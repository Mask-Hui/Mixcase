Particularly when the news is so terrible as it is this morning. They found that missing 11-yr old girl in florida, dead. I guess after elizabeth smart was found alive i have higher hopes. But there was no happy ending this time. Makes me sick that people can do that to other human beings. Top that with the suicide bombing in moscow today killing around 40 people. We hear stuff like this all the time. Israel, afghanistan, iraq. Can't believe how good we have it here in canada."

Unfortunatly the urllink busselton jetty was damaged in a recent storm so we couldn't go down to the underwater aquarium at the end but we did get to admire the huge jetty.

Most of the time however, fear creeps up with sure-footed grace, moving to the corners of a mind inclined to doubt because of its humanity. And i guess, i'm not very lucky today. Is it really worth being strong, and being proud if the price it demands are insecurities that cannot be assuaged by the light of consolation? and still, how could i not be strong or proud, when too many times, vulnerability was met with nothing but rejection or disdain?"

She also usually will eat cheese when it is offered, and she eats a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch. Most of her calories are coming from bread, fruit, and vegetables. My questions is this, how do vegetarians get the protein they need? i know that soy (tofu) is a good source, but i really doubt she will eat it."

Aep can capture the economics of future gas deliveres to entex associated with this capital expenditure. 2. Captures the leverage that aep will have in the entex audit.

Pros: combat system, raids, dungeons, housing, cash shop that isnt p2w, lore, visuals. Combat : after playing wildstar, i can not go back to a tab targeting mmo again. It is so much fun just to attack things. Dungeons and raids : raids are one of the most fun i have had in any mmo and the dungeons are really cool too. Housing : housing was something i thought that i would never touch but it is sooooo customizable that i have lost countless of hours in housing and there are soooo many housing options it is insane."

Although this game isn't as story heavy, it did give birth to one of the most good popular games of 2011. I still play this game and beat it when i am feeling bored and i love to come back and to see what gave birth to a legend and what is a legend. Gameplay: portal's gameplay is quite simple, to explain at least. You use portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate a part of the puzzle. Two buttons are in the game, one that you press and one that you need a cube to put on."

Money just lets you obtain them faster. Limiting how much stuff you can have at once feels like a fair monetization system. After all, if you have played enough to need more inventory space, you should probably offer some cash as thanks. That said, it is possible to earn the cash currency through trading."

That said, it ends on a cliff-hanger, which alludes to a episode 2, meaning there's another episode to fill in the gaps. Personally, i can't wait for episode 2, the ending left me awestruck by the sudden turn of events. Overall, i enjoyed reading this visual novel, looking forward to what happens in the next episode."

While fans of the original series may be upset at the change to their beloved character, it\u2019s certainly for the better; and this new game by ninja theory proves it. Dmc serves as the perfect point for newcomers to jump into the series. It shows the origins of an arrogant, cynical dante, and it chronicles his journey from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear, narrative arc for the new dante, making him a compelling character to watch.image the story follows dante as he\u2019s introduced into the corrupt world he willfully chose to ignore. Mungus, demon leader of the media-controlled world, sets out to destroy dante, a surviving member of the sparda family, and the only man who can stop the tyrannical rule of mungus.

When agents of mayhem eventually releases, i'm hopeful that volition will have developed it with their strengths in mind, and not their weaknesses. Saints row: the third is at its best early on.

Each lit light node upgrades your jump height a bit, and if you manage to touch all of them in the room without leaving, they stay lit forever. After a few rooms you find your first power up, teleport, which changes the game (and puzzle) mechanics quite significantly. You see, while you can teleport freely, you require at least one lit light node to do so, and teleporting clears a 3x3 grid around you - so if you were standing on a light node, it will deactivate."

It's a good game to play casually. Though i doubt it will hold your attention beyond a few months unless you just really like grinding.

The devs are very active in the community, and it really shows in the various discussion forums and dev diaries. There is a fairly steep learning curve to the game's mechanics of which i am still trying to learn; however, this breadth of strategy allows you a myriad of ways to reach goals and take advantage of certain situations. The game, in my mind, is almost infinitely replayable."

As usual would suggest using a gamepad but personally i had no problems with a keymouse/mouse setup, both completely rebindable. Price is about right and wouldn't have been unhappy about a purchase. More then half the dlc is included free, which is still plenty to play with. Recommended game to all jrpg/anime/visualnovel fans, provided you don't mind long breaks between the action. Cheers.

The game doesnt have a huge array of objects so i really hate when values make certian objects irrivelent, for example exalt laser weapons are really cool looking in compairson to the clunky versions of xcom's laser weapons so they are now one point better than plasma weapons which makes them very valuable and creates a fourth tier weapons. Some may debate that it's cheating but up the difficulty level and it becomes enrichment. Right now it is unclear wheather fraxis is working on what is a mojor expansion or perhaps xcom2, but they have made it clear it is their 'next big project' and it is a continuation of xcom eu/ew."

Such enthusiasm is unlikely to dampen any time soon and experts predict that by the end of next year the numbers will have risen to more than eight million, or more than 30% of homes.

        "HWT_sentence": "Pension hitch for long-living men male life expectancy is much higher than originally estimated, leading pension researchers have said. The pensions policy institute (ppi) said life expectancy for unskilled and professional men has been understated. Life expectancy at birth is 71 years for a manual worker and 79 years for a professional - a gap of eight years. But if measured at age 65 instead, the ppi said, a manual worker will live to 81 years and a professional worker to 86 years - a gap of just five years. The ppi's estimate is higher because it excludes people who have died before they reach 65 years of age and also takes into account ongoing improvements in life expectancy. The government has ruled out raising the state pension age, because it says it would penalise lower-skilled workers who generally have lower life expectancies."

The commission's decision gave the same legal protection to feta as to italian parma ham and french champagne. But critics of the judgement say feta is a generic term, with the cheese produced widely outside greece. The commission's controversial 2002 ruling gave \"protected designation of origin\" status to feta cheese made in greece, effectively restricting the use of the feta name to producers there. From 2007 onwards, greek firms will have the exclusive use of the feta label and producers elsewhere in europe must find another name to describe their products."

This means the expected hash values need to be adjusted in the binary executable, hence combining sc with other protections is limited due to this adjustment step. However, obfuscation protections are often necessary, as sc protections can be otherwise easily detected and disabled via pattern matching. In this paper, we present a layered protection using virtualization obfuscation, yielding an architecture-agnostic sc protection that requires no post-compilation adjustment.

In this limit we find that, at leading order, the van-der-waals forces are fully-resonant and grow linearly in time, being different upon each atom. The resultant net force upon the two-atom system is related to the directionality of spontaneous emission, which results from the violation of parity symmetry."

In this work, we study propagation heuristics that guide developers to find the actual impacted units and termination heuristics that help to decide whether the estimated impact is complete.

Variable selection in the presence of both missing covariates and outcomes is an important statistical research topic but has been less studied. Existing literature focuses on parametric regression techniques that provide direct parameter estimates of the regression model. In practice, parametric regression models are often sub-optimal for variable selection because they are susceptible to misspecification. Machine learning methods considerably weaken the parametric assumptions and increase modeling flexibility, but do not provide as naturally defined variable importance measure as the covariate effect native to parametric models. We investigate a general variable selection approach when both the covariates and outcomes can be missing at random and have general missing data patterns. This approach exploits the flexibility of machine learning modeling techniques and bootstrap imputation, which is amenable to nonparametric methods in which the covariate effects are not directly available."

The force varies over several orders of magnitude, which poses a serious challenge for the usual machine learning models. To overcome this difficulty, the magnitudes and the signs of the force are separated and modelled separately.

These discrepancies can be explained if there exist extra vector-like quarks at the tev scale, which have large enough mixings with the lighter quarks."

        "HWT_sentence": "Signal separation and extraction are important tasks for devices recording audio signals in real environments which, aside from the desired sources, often contain several interfering sources such as background noise or concurrent speakers. Blind source separation (bss) provides a powerful approach to address such problems. However, bss algorithms typically treat all sources equally and do not resolve uncertainty regarding the ordering of the separated signals at the output of the algorithm, i.e., the outer permutation problem. This paper addresses this problem by incorporating prior knowledge into the adaptation of the demixing filters, e.g., the position of the sources, in a bayesian framework."

One of the most prominent ideas in the field is a model of quantum playing a 2x2 game introduced by j. Eisert, m. Wilkens and m. Lewenstein. The scheme assumes that players' strategies are unitary operations the players act on the maximally entangled two-qubit state. The quantum nature of the scheme has been under discussion since the article by eisert et al. Came out. The aim of our paper is to identify some of non-classical features of the quantum scheme."

Here two physical rc systems based on a single magnetic skyrmion memristor (msm) and 24 spin-torque nano-oscillators (stnos) were proposed and modeled to process image classification task and nonlinear dynamic system prediction, respectively. Based on our micromagnetic simulation results on the nonlinear responses of msm and stno with current pulses stimulation, the handwritten digits recognition task domesticates that an rc system using one single msm has the outstanding performance on image classification. In addition, the complex unknown nonlinear dynamic problems can also be well solved by a physical rc system consisted of 24 stnos confirmed in a second-order nonlinear dynamic system and narma10 tasks."

About the size of the great wall of china, this would hardly be an invisible structure. And yet it's made from parts that are invisible, or near-invisible, to the naked eye: bacteria and grains of sand.now, as architects we're trained to solve problems. But i don't really believe in architectural problems; i only believe in opportunities. Which is why i'll show you a threat, and an architectural response. The threat is desertification. My response is a sandstone wall made from bacteria and solidified sand, stretching across the desert.now, sand is a magical material of beautiful contradictions. It is simple and complex."

But what did he appeal to? he did not, happily, follow in the footsteps of his predecessor, and tell us to just go shopping. Nor did he tell us, \"trust us. Trust your country. Invest, invest, invest.\" instead, what he told us was to put aside childish things. And he appealed to virtue. Virtue is an old-fashioned word. It seems a little out of place in a cutting-edge environment like this one."

To turn a plant into something resembling milk, it must be either soaked, drained, rinsed, and milled into a thick paste, or dried, and milled into flour. The plant paste or flour is then fortified with vitamins and minerals, flavoured, and diluted with water.the result is a barrage of options that share many of the qualities of animal milk. So which milk is actually best for you?"

We are all familiar with these mundane, everyday objects. The fact that some of the victims carried personal items such as toothpaste and a toothbrush is a clear sign they had no idea what was about to happen to them. Usually, they were told that they were going to be exchanged for prisoners of war.these items have been recovered from numerous mass graves across my homeland, and as we speak, forensics are exhuming bodies from newly discovered mass graves, 20 years after the war."

As firefighters, my team and i are tasked with saving lives and property from such disasters as car wrecks, house fires and also life-threatening medical emergencies. I am a woman leading a department in a male-dominated profession.and 10 years ago, i decided to increase my medical knowledge and i received a nursing degree. That was because it became clear that the next big threat facing not only my city, but other cities around the country, was not the one-and-done disaster, where you can ride in like the cavalry, as a firefighter, put out the fire and leave, feeling like you have made a difference and everything is ok."

But if you get the grade \"not yet\", you understand that you're on a learning curve. It gives you a path into the future. \"not yet\" also gave me insight into a critical event early in my career, a real turning point. I wanted to see how children coped with challenge and difficulty, so i gave 10-year-olds problems that were slightly too hard for them."

I'm going to talk about a new, old material that still continues to amaze us, and that might impact the way we think about material science, high technology \u2014 and maybe, along the way, also do some stuff for medicine and for global health and help reforestation. So that's kind of a bold statement. I'll tell you a little bit more. This material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true. It's sustainable; it's a sustainable material that is processed all in water and at room temperature \u2014 and is biodegradable with a clock, so you can watch it dissolve instantaneously in a glass of water or have it stable for years. It's edible; it's implantable in the human body without causing any immune response. It actually gets reintegrated in the body."

You know, back in the late '80s, this big mac clamshell was the symbol of a garbage crisis. People were really angry. For example, thousands of students, young students around the globe were sending letters, blaming mcdonald's, because we were using millions of these at that time. Now, no one at mcdonald's knew anything about environmentally friendly packaging, including me. The last 10 years, i was in charge of logistics and truck drivers."

That's a cool invention, literally. In africa, if you run out of your cell phone battery, don't panic. You will find some resourceful entrepreneurs who can recharge your cell phone using bicycles. And since we are in south america, let's go to lima in peru, a region with high humidity that receives only one inch of rainfall each year.

And that is the time that my brave parents rented an rv, packed it with me and my brothers, and drove west from our house in minneapolis, out to yellowstone national park. We saw all the sights, like the geysers, we stopped at the badlands, but more than any of the places, i remember this as an adventure.this was my introduction to the wild west. But it wasn't until i got older and i learned more about the national park system that i realized just how lucky i was. One, to have that experience, but also that, hundreds of years ago, people had the foresight to set aside the very best places, the very best ecosystems in the country, for everyone. And for future generations."

This little metal ball, smaller than two feet in diameter, launched a space race between the u.s. And u.s.s.r. That would last for eighteen years and change the world as we know it. Sputnik was actually not the first piece of human technology to enter space. That superlative goes to the v-2 rocket used by germany in missile attacks against allied cities as a last-ditch effort in the final years of world war ii."

What i remember the most is, as i put my head in the water and i was trying really hard to breathe through the snorkel, this huge group of striped yellow and black fish came straight at me ... And i just froze. And then, as if it had suddenly changed its mind, came towards me and then swerved to the right and went right around me. It was absolutely mesmerizing.
