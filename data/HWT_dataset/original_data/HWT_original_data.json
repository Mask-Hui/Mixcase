And seeing these young people from new york city go on to not just become college students but to participate in study abroad programs and to then take jobs around the world was incredibly gratifying.when i think of my kids and all the doctors, lawyers, teachers, social workers, journalists and artists who came from our little nook in new york city, i hate to think of what would have happened if we hadn't invested in the middle."

        "HWT_sentence": "In 2015, the lhc will almost double the energy of the colliding protons, and these more powerful collisions will allow us to explore further the particle world, and we will certainly learn much more.but for the moment, since we have found no evidence for new phenomena, let us suppose that the particles that we know today, including the higgs boson, are the only elementary particles in nature, even at energies much larger than what we have explored so far. This is tiny when expressed in familiar units, because it's equal to something like 10 to the minus 22 grams, but it is large in particle physics units, because it is equal to the weight of an entire molecule of a dna constituent.so armed with this information from the lhc, together with some colleagues here at cern, we computed the probability that our universe could quantum tunnel into the ultra-dense higgs state, and we found a very intriguing result."
