In their farewell two-disc set, five iron combines an all-new full-length album ('the end is near' - disc 1) and a complete live recording of their final concert ('the end is here' - disc 2). Having attained a huge cult following among america's youth, i don't think i can fully describe the impact five iron has had over the years. I'll let this review speak for me: by aleem hossain 'it\u2019s impossible to do the album justice in a short review as it is quintessential of everything fif has stood for."

Beliefs are soon shattered, confusion exists. Faith so shallow, praying for bliss. The mists of the path, foggy and dense, lessons of suffering, joy sings from the fence. Slowly i learn, why must i suffer? to give so easy, to receive is tougher. Open the heart, risk to be taken, balance of two, not be forsaken. Alone i now sit, life scattered and tattered. Of my own making, does it really matter? strength from within, now i must find. Depend on one self, god in due time."

That tradition has died, but we get nostalgic every now and then. Last night was one of those times. Of course, after we finish up the margaritas, she leaves to go see her boyfriend and i'm left w/ nothing to do for 2 hours (till the boy goes to work & she plans on hanging out w/ me again)."

'my child,' he said in somber tones, 'for miles i carried you alone. I challenged you to walk in faith, but you refused and made me wait.' you disobeyed, you would not grow, the walk of faith, you would not know, so i got tired, i got fed up, and there i dropped you on your butt.

Mind you,i played through the offline training mode and it was stuttering/lagging as well (how does that even happen?). Couple that with the poor ping,and it just ruins the game. .

I quite hate pre-quals as it's technically going backwards in a story and not forwards (this is an issue for every pre-qual). Granted it offers more storywise. The combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as arkham city managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013) there is a game breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story not effected). Some gadgets are put at a rediculous hotkey that makes your hand have to travel the whole keyboard to get to it.

It is so much fun just to attack things. Dungeons and raids : raids are one of the most fun i have had in any mmo and the dungeons are really cool too. Housing : housing was something i thought that i would never touch but it is sooooo customizable that i have lost countless of hours in housing and there are soooo many housing options it is insane. Cash shop: the cash shop has some cool and intersting costumes, mounts and things such as rng tokens, flasks (for leveling etc) but is does not have any p2w items."

This may be one of the only multiplayer games where killing an enemy feels extremely rewarding, because the weapons are slow but powerful. Sadly, there is one fault of the game.

It can be an instakill with a headshot, which are easy to land with it with enough practice. Still, the game is fun and i will play it a lot more over the next few weeks."

It is an odd mix between a classic 2d platformer and an moba, and does it with style. I found myself enjoying characters that i wouldn't enjoy in other moba games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a go anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked from playing games. The art style and interface is oddly charming. As such, i now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game. As for the audio, the voice acting is grin-worthy, with music and effects adding to the 80's cartoon vibe."

Half the story relies on shock factor. I was not shocked nor emotionally moved in any way by this. Maybe i'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simple to warrant a reaction out of me. As for the other half of the game, it tries to paint a picture (literally) of a person in mental decline. It deals with obsession, hallucination, depression and a few other things. In theory it is a cool idea. But the 'game' took me 10 minutes to complete, and that is with reading and taking in every little bit of information i could. 10 minutes is not enough time to even brush the surface of one these mental illnesses, let alone all of them present."

If you look in the discussion threads, you can find a patch but even then, it's too glitchy. Brace yourself for inconsistent collisions. You can shoot through some fences, but not other, identical fences. The shooting was never tomb raider's strong point but for a 2006 game, it feels a little like a dreamcast game like dynamite cop.

As an example let's say you have a choice of three combat skills which are +5% fast attack damage, +5% strong attack damage or +2% crossbow critical chance. The fast and strong attack options are going to be good depending on how you play, and putting points into one or the other will further sculpt your style of play down that path, so this feels organic and works well."

I'm not intriqued by the story at all, the gun play is terrible, the mouse will show up on screen along with the cross hair and distract you constantly, the mouse sensitivty is horribly low for a game where you have not much health. Overall, is it worth your dollar, not really in my opinion, but i like more sensible comedy rather than hey lets talk about \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 and \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. The graphics aren't impressive, at all."

Not very original though and a bit limiting when it comes to pathing. If i want to jump off a hill, i should be able to! or go down the stairs the way i want it etc. As mentioned, the combat is awesome and as a soundtrack lover, i also loved the music. I'd give the game a solid 7 out 10."

Winn-dixie, once among the most profitable of us grocers, said chapter 11 protection would enable it to successfully restructure. It said its 920 stores would remain open, but analysts said it would most likely off-load a number of sites. The jacksonville, florida-based firm has total debts of $1.87bn (\u00a3980m). In its bankruptcy petition it listed its biggest creditor as us foods giant kraft foods, which it owes $15.1m. Analysts say winn-dixie had not kept up with consumers' demands and had also been burdened by a number of stores in need of upgrading."

In this paper, we conduct a systematic analysis of how to make and evaluate probabilistic forecasts from such simulation output. Based on proper scoring rules, we develop a notion of consistency that allows to assess the adequacy of methods for estimating the stationary distribution underlying the simulation output. We then provide asymptotic results that account for the salient features of bayesian posterior simulators, and derive conditions under which choices from the literature satisfy our notion of consistency. Importantly, these conditions depend on the scoring rule being used, such that the choices of approximation method and scoring rule are intertwined."

Here, we studied the fluorescence anomalous saturating effect of the nitrogen vacancy defect in diamond. The fluorescence reduction was observed with high power laser excitation. It increased the nonlinearity of the fluorescence emission, and changed the spatial frequency distribution of the fluorescence image. We used a differential excitation protocol to extract the high spatial frequency information. By modulating the excitation laser's power, the spatial resolution of imaging was improved approximate 1.6 times in comparison with the confocal microscopy. Due to the simplicity of the experimental setup and data processing, we expect this method can be used for improving the spatial resolution of sensing and biological labeling with the defects in solids."

Using these, we bootstrap various matter-coupled gauge-theory and gravitational scattering amplitudes, and conjecture that topologically massive gauge theory and topologically massive gravity are related by the double copy. To motivate this idea further, we show explicitly that the landau gauge propagator on the gauge theory side double copies to the de donder gauge propagator on the gravity side."

Such data are commonly found in spatial applications, such as climatology and criminology, where measurements are restricted to a geographical area.

A simple approach to modeling such data is through the use of mixture models, especially nonparametric mixture models. Mixture models, while flexible and theoretically well-understood, are unsuitable for settings involving complicated constraints, leading to difficulties in specifying the component distributions and in evaluating normalization constants. Bayesian inference over the parameters of these models results in posterior distributions that are doubly-intractable.

Continuing this analogy, when two atoms are close enough to form a molecule so that their orbitals start overlapping, the orbitals' energies start to split into bonding and anti-bonding states made out of hybridized orbitals. The same concept is also applicable for two fused core-shell nanocrystals in close proximity. Their band-edge states, which dictate the emitted photon energy, start to hybridize changing their electronic and optical properties.

As a practical example, we use the theory to describe the interaction of two crossed plane waves and a prolate spheroidal particle.

The addition of such a shear load accelerates frictional aging while the aging rate of the real area of contact is unaffected. Moreover, a negative static shear - pulling instead of pushing - slows frictional aging, but similarly does not affect the aging of contacts. The origin of this shear effect on aging is geometrical.

And in these bustling streets of our guts, we see a constant influx of food, and every microbe has a job to do. Here's a cellulolytic bacteria, for example. Their one job is to break down cellulose, a common compound in vegetables, into sugars. Those simple sugars then move along to the respirators, another set of microbes that snatch up these simple sugars and burn them as fuel."

But now, they must divvy up the booty according to the pirate code. As captain, amaro gets to propose how to distribute the coins. Then, each pirate, including amaro himself, gets to vote either yarr or nay. If the vote passes, or if there's a tie, the coins are divided according to plan. But if the majority votes nay, amaro must walk the plank and bart becomes captain. Then, bart gets to propose a new distribution and all remaining pirates vote again."

That's what journalism is for.that's the beauty of journalism: to question and challenge the powerful. Of course, we have the obligation to report reality as it is, not how we would like it to be."

Now we can do it at a level greater than 99 percent accuracy. This is called image classification \u2014 give it an image, put a label to that image \u2014 and computers know thousands of other categories as well.i'm a graduate student at the university of washington, and i work on a project called darknet, which is a neural network framework for training and testing computer vision models. So let's just see what darknet thinks of this image that we have."

        "HWT_sentence": "Three years ago, i started building a decentralized web because i was worried about the future of our internet.the current internet we are using is about gatekeepers. If you want to reach something on the web, then you need to go through multiple middlemen. First, a domain name server, then a server hosting company, which usually points you to a third party, to a web hosting service. And this happens every time you want to reach a website on the web.but these gatekeepers are vulnerable to internet attacksand also makes the censorship and the surveillance easier. And the situation is getting worse. Everything is moving to the cloud, where the data is hosted by giant corporations."

Since hpv is often transmitted through sexual activity, this usually means the cells of the vagina, vulva, penis, anus, mouth and throat. We can test for hpv in cells from these areas, but while testing for the virus is scientifically possible, it isn\u2019t common."

We call them the elders because a half a billion years ago they tripled the amount of oxygen in the air, which led to an explosion of life, which led to all of us. We call them the elders, but you probably know them as plankton. (laughter) now, simone is a physicist, and i'm an inventor. A couple of years ago, i was giving a talk about an invention i made \u2014 it was a 3d microscope. And simone was in the audience. He realized that my microscope could solve a big problem he was having."

And the way that we're going to uncover this vestigial organ of america past is by asking this question: why? as we all know \u2014 (laughter) we are in the middle of another presidential election, hotly contested, as you can see. (laughter) but what you may not know is that american voter turnout ranks near the bottom of all countries in the entire world, 138th of 172 nations. This is the world's most famous democracy. So ... Why do we vote on tuesday? does anybody know? and as a matter of fact, michigan and arizona are voting today."

So, music videos are something that i always found interesting, but they always seem to be so reactive. So i was thinking, can you remove us as creators and try to make the music be the voice and have the animation following it? so with two designers, tolga and christina, at my office, we took a track \u2014 many of you probably know it. It\u2019s about 25 years old, and it's david byrne and brian eno \u2014 and we did this little animation."

The ability to program electrons on a material called silicon made possible technologies, companies and industries that were at one point unimaginable to many of us, but which have now fundamentally changed the way the world works. The first half of this century, though, is going to be transformed by a new software revolution: the living software revolution. And this will be powered by the ability to program biochemistry on a material called biology. And doing so will enable us to harness the properties of biology to generate new kinds of therapies, to repair damaged tissue, to reprogram faulty cells or even build programmable operating systems out of biochemistry."

And space is limited, so at every table, one pair of players practices forehands, another practices backhands, and every now and then, the balls collide in midair and everybody says, \"wow!\" then, choosing lots, we select partners and play doubles. But i honestly couldn't tell you who's won, because we change partners every five minutes. And everybody is trying really hard to win points, but nobody is keeping track of who is winning games."

One is imposed on the environment, the other creates it. One is designed for nature, the other is designed by her.michelangelo said that when he looked at raw marble, he saw a figure struggling to be free. The chisel was michelangelo's only tool. But living things are not chiseled. They grow. And in our smallest units of life, our cells, we carry all the information that's required for every other cell to function and to replicate.tools also have consequences. At least since the industrial revolution, the world of design has been dominated by the rigors of manufacturing and mass production."

Making sense of those things is a very difficult thing to do. And when i was 12, i became an actor. I was bottom of the class. I haven't got any qualifications. I was told i was dyslexic. In fact, i have got qualifications. I got a d in pottery, which was the one thing that i did get \u2014 which was useful, obviously. And so concern is where all of this comes from."
