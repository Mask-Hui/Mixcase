I know that indicates i'm thinking wrong about things, but until i can get my mind around the right way to go about picturing myself, at least i'm happy. I saw this movie yesterday called 'the grass is always greener'. Fantastic. Also: i love it how the economist and the wall street journal can say the same thing about the economy, i mean recite the same facts, but convince you of opposite states of affairs at the same time. It really goes along with donald davidson's thesis about paradigms and evidence. Melech rachaman, rachem aleinu. Tov umeitiv hidaresh lanu."

She was born at 12:30 in the afternoon and weighs 8 lb. 2 oz. That's a very happy and exciting thing! it's a second child for jen and adam, and a little sister for their almost-3-year-old son, connor. Our church has been working through the 40 days of purpose, based on the book 'the purpose driven life' by rick warren. I've been leading a weekly small group in my house; we met tonight. It was really good. I am seeing a lot of growth in all the people who have been attending - a lot of this was shown in the prayer time, which was a really wonderful time of worship. I've been getting a lot out of it, too. A lot of the stuff i'm 'learning' i was already aware of, but never really 'got'."

My perception of this character can be whole lot different from someone else's view. Roark, precisely, is a super thinker and to-the-core rationalist. Narrated as an athesist, more aptly an intellectual athesist*. He choose architecture to be his reason to live, and he stood by his decision. And me, anything but what i have said above. Follower of intutions and a believer of destiny. Personality and acumen can be sharpened by constant thinking and be refined by reading good books.

But global sales of recorded music were flat in 2004, with growing sales in dvd music videos offset by online and physical piracy in major markets. The uk music industry recorded an overall 3% increase in volume sales, mostly due to its robust albums market. However, world music sales declined by 1.3% to $33.6 billion (\u00a317.7 billion)."

With a meta-learning framework, quick adaptation to each task and its effective backpropagation are important since the model is trained by the adaptation for each epoch.

Iot apps subscribe to events and upon receipt, transmit actuation commands which trigger a set of actuators. Events and actuation commands follow paths in the iot ecosystem such as sensor-to-edge, edge-to-cloud, and cloud-to-actuator, with different network and processing delays between these connections. Significant delays may occur especially when an iot system cloud interacts with other clouds. Due to this variation in delays, the cloud may receive events in an incorrect order, and in turn, devices may receive and actuate misordered commands. In this paper, we first study eight major iot platforms and show that they do not make strong guarantees on event orderings to address these issues. We then analyze the end-to-end interactions among iot components, from the creation of an event to the invocation of a command."
