I could tell by the menu screen this game was going to be creepy. First night: i look at my cameras and notice the bear is starting to move a little. I start to think everything is ok but its been awhile since i checked my cameras. I glance down at my camera and see there is no bunny. It takes me a second to process it and i pull up the camera a second time to confirm that the bunny is gone. Now i'm starting to hear things in the hallway and i start to press my light in small flickers trying to conserve power. I turn the light on and then the bunny is right there leaning in the room and i about have a heart attack as i reach and slam the door button down. When 6 clock comes around and you still have enough battery to keep your door closed it will be such a relief. I made it to night 3 on my first go but didnt press the door quickly enough and its really scarry if you dont :(
