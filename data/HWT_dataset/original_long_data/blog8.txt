This is kind of a continuation of a previos story line in my blog and has to do with my job. If my readers will remember i have been in trouble with my boss for not doing a good job and coming in late and basically being a bad horrible person. Well imagine my surprise when i came to work today to find a 'spirit award' sitting on my desk. These are given out to employees that capture the spirit of the hospital workplace and go above and beyond what is expected of them. Do they know who they gave it to? the best part is that it can be handed out by any manager and i got one from my bosses boss. This doesn't change my work situation at all, but man was i surprised.
