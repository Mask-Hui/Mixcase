So i've worked a variety of shifts before but never actual shift work. Let me tell you people that have not had this wonderful experience for yourself... It sucks. My mind is so messed up i don't know when it is day and when it is night or wether or not i should be awake or asleep or tired or not. Time or day, sun or moon, light or dark... Doesn't matter. I just worked 3 nights (11:30pm-7:30am) then one day off then 1 day (7:30am-3:30pm) then 3 evenings (3:30pm-11:30pm) then one day off then 1 night (11:30pm-7:30am) my mind is in a muddle! i like my new job a lot. It is very interesting. Everything was going great up until my shift tonight when... Some crazy bastard threw up on my desk... The joys of working in health care :(
