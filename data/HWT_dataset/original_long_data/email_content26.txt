Please confirm your interest and availability to set aside 30 minutes, or so dec 6, 7 or 8, for me in houston this week. I am in a final phase of an expat re-assignment or relocation and would like to discuss with you: enron's pricing, structuring and position-taking capability for south america etc.,.. Expected to be in place from the year 2000, at least in power in brazil. Failure/successes and immediate opportunities in the enron brazil and south america core (gas, power) and multiple commodity commercial effort(s), including e-business/networks issues. Finance expertise - the critical role that functional groups like enron metals' (trade and structure finance group) and the global markets insurance/global risk groups will (need to) play in helping develop critical, internal enron finance, risk assessment and mitigation expertise to support the competitiveness and viability of closing commercial transactions in south america and elsewhere my priority to help form and be re-assigned to a "bundle products" origination business unit designed to initiate transactions which specifically and formally leverage synergies across enron business units - to potentially include in brazil, at least, power, pulp & paper, steel networks, crude and products, and insurance/global risk. Please find attatched files which detail some of my ideas for developing the core gas and power trading and origination efforts and including the bundled product unit. The files were appropriately forwarded to dave/john. I have also attatched my cv should you be interested to review my background and experience and mention, as a reminder, that a meeting is critical in potentially determining the outcome of my expat re-assignment or re-location process, needed to be concluded this month, dec 2000. Thank you for any efforts extended in my behalf.
