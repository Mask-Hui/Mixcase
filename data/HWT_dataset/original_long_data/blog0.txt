Since i have not been blogging for very long, you have not realized everything that has gone into my efforts to break 80 on 18 holes over the past 2+ years since i broke 90. Today all of those struggles finally came to fruition as i made about a 5 footer for a 78 on the last hole. I had to go 27 holes to get it, and it was hot out today. I think 92ish, with more or less no wind. So i am quite happy right now. Honestly, i think i will be satisfied with my golf 'career' from now on, as i hold no expectations of breaking 70 or anything. I am kind of busy right now, so this is a short post, but i just had to get this out there and spread the good news!
