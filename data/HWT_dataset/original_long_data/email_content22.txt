How about them lakers !!! there is only one thing i can say..... Or maybe 3 words. Men against boys !!. Didn't they just kick ass! they are peaking at just the right time. The dodgers are in first place and the kings have gone beyond everyone's expectations. Life is good in southern california. On the down side, ramon got admitted into the hospital over the weekend. It started out as a problem with very low blood sugar but then escalated into a weak heart problem with very shallow breathing. They have him on a respirator and plan to wean him off of that this morning. Cita is all stressed out but thank god that one of her neighbors is spending the night with her. We're getting an update today on some tests performed on ramon, so we'll know alot more. Cita is doing fairly well. I took her for a four hour heart exam last week and it revealed that her last heart attack caused some arterial damage. The doctor said that if she was younger, he would perform angioplasty. In any case, her spirits are remarkably high and is still mentally sharp. On another matter, i got a call last friday from ford motor credit regarding your account. They left a number and asked if you could call them because "they have not been able to reach you". The number they left was 877-873-0085. Apparently, you left me as a reference on the application. Hope you are doing ok and am looking forward to seeing you in june!
