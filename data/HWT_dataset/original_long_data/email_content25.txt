This announcement has not gone out for that reason. We have had a number of discussions about it since this was drafted and there seems to be some concern about it being inside one of the business units since it is supposed to handle investments across the company and would be bringing the ebs assets with it. Your suggestion that it might report to andy has some merit, but there may be other options. What would you think if we established an investment committee consisting of me, rice, and delainey and made garland responsible to that group. We would have all of the relevent business units represented and the p&l would ultimately be allocated to the one in which the investment originated. Do you think that would work? it might go a long way to satisfying all constituents.
