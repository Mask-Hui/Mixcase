Hey there guzman! you said you didn't have my e-mail, so here ya are bro. So, did you go to game 3 the other day? i didn't get to watch it 'cause i went abalone diving in fort bragg. I did however see they had a significant lead toward the end of fourth (as i stopped in a mini-mart to get a coke). Maybe you could fill me in on the details...did you get a chance to talk with kobe after the game? friday they're gonna cut the dead wood out of my elbow. Hopefully it won't take long to heal up, and then i'll be headed up that way, to corvallis, to look for a place for the summer. I took my subject gre on saturday and felt pretty good about it. Of course, they make you wait six weeks to get the results back from a scantron test. We must be in the computer age. Well alright then, i'll let you get back to work so that the citizens of this great nation don't miss out on any great power bargains. Let me know when you have your days off. Stacey is graduating on the 19th, so i'll be in sacramento then...but after that i'll probably be heading up that way to have a pitcher at clods.
