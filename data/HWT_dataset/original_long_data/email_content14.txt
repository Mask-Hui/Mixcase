In response to glen hass' voicemail identifying his concerns regarding the remaining mainline capacity going west, i have included additional data on the revised file attached below. Only the second worksheet entitled 'tw primary holder' was modified. I have added the remaining contract data where capacity is held in arizona. I have also provided sub-totals and totals where applicable for ease of verification. Please feel free to contact me if you need additional information. I will continue to check my voicemail/email periodically during my vacation.
