Wow! how about this...maurice clarett can urllink enter the nfl draft . Will this be agood thing or a bad thing? i've read several opinions on this and i think i have to agree, that this is a wrong decision. The nfl has very clear guidelines and on when they will accept a player and they are not discriminating. Urllink whatever happened to good common sense ? here's urllink one guy that thinks it won't make a difference to the nfl. What do you think?
