I'm an old man and not very good at most games. I had to play this game at the lowest setting and did not die too many times. Well, several times towards the end, but i finished the game. It took me 14 hours (i know...i said i'm old) and i have to say that i was very impressed! i purchased the prima guide and reviewed it before and during the game and was able to get a lot more out of the game than i would have otherwise. Those who are giving this game a low rating are probably just rushing from point a to point b so fast that you can't possibly appreciate all of the differences and subtle nuances. Plus...the guide helps with skillshots, collectibles and achievements. How about looking for the good in something rather than always looking for the bad? i really liked this game including the crude humor. I think it's a solid 10!
