While I personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't absolutely terrible. The gunplay is alright, so long as you have the money to purchase gun parts, which would be my main complaint with this game: it's pay-to-win. If I could get past that, the game would be enjoyable, as the Hardsuit is fun to use and HRV is an excellent idea. I'd take this game over any Call of Duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransanction format is off-putting for me. If you are alright with this model, then by all means, have fun. But if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, just let this one slide; it's not our cup of tea.
