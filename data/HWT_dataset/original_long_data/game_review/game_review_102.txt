-randomly generated levels that have no coherent direction or personality -terrible frame rate issues with awful stuttering -muddy as can be textures and visuals with terrible post process effects like chromatic aberration -game crashes that are caused during multiplayer than can make your progresss be totally lost on a level -guns feel like air rifles -humour that a 6th grader would find a bit brash how the ♥♥♥♥ did this come from the same people who made shadow warrior 2013? very suprising how little this game has tried to improve, if anything, its a digression, go buy shadow warrior 2013, or the new doom far better titles than this pile of barely playable junk
