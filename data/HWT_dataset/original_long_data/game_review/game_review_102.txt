-Randomly generated levels that have no coherent direction or personality -Terrible frame rate issues with awful stuttering -Muddy as can be textures and visuals with terrible Post process effects like Chromatic Aberration -Game crashes that are caused during multiplayer than can make your progresss be totally lost on a level -Guns feel like air rifles -Humour that a 6th grader would find a bit brash  How the ♥♥♥♥ did this come from the same people who made shadow warrior 2013? Very suprising how little this game has tried to improve, if anything, its a digression, go buy shadow warrior 2013, or the new DOOM far better titles than this pile of barely playable junk
