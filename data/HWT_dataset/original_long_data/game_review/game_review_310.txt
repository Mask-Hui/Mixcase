I was negatively biased towards this game before i played it. Wasn't even sure about buying. I dunno, the whole portal gun and portals thing seemed weird to me even though i like science fiction. Boy was i wrong. The jokes and voice acting in this game is phenomenal. Just amazing. It's not cheesy (ok it's sometimes cheesy). And different story characters have all their own sense of humour. Those different characters do really have different personalities. And the level design; it's just rad. Btw i never played the first portal game. One of these days, i'm planning to if i can spare the time. I would never have played it if i hadn't played the sequel. So it's that amazing. What are you doing in this game? it's actually the sequel to the first portal game like i said. But basically, you are trapped inside a training facility. A training for puzzle solving. The thing is, the facility is offline, and nothing is working. It's derelict. And the show runner is nowhere to be seen. Then you are woken up in the middle of all this, by your only friend. Together you try leaving it while solving puzzles that concern teleportation and portals. Then things happen. And everything turns weird. Like i said, there is a lot more to it than this, but this is all one can reveal without spoiling it. This game would be a solid 10/10 which i wouldn't rate for the 90% of other games in my library. + there is online co-op and a mod for local co-op + challenge mode + download community-made levels + hilarious voice acting and jokes + seriously intriguing story + i never thought robots' personalities would be so awesome. Oh wait + time travel + ripping your hair off during puzzles + resist temptation for walkthrough videos + co op is amazing (laughed a bit too much) + single player is amazing + teleportation makes sense and no sense at all at the same time + nice music + nice graphics 10/10 would love glados to the death again
