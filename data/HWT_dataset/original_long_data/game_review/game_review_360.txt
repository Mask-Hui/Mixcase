This game have interesting concept very similar to Surgeon Simulator, but the gameplay is a little hard to get used too without giving it proper time to adapt and may give you the wrong impression. This is a low budget game, so look at it was that and dont expect something diferent or you will be frustrated, its enough to give you some entertainement for few hours with some hilarious moments. I still found it fun enough to recommend it, but if you rage to easly, stay way from it bc 4 achievements is the only thing you will get from the game until you uninstall it.
