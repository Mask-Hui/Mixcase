This is easily the best online co-op game of the modern era. Great graphics, fun gameplay, and an outstanding sountrack make this all the better. If you're this far into reviews for this game, you've likely seen people complaining about 'boo hoo hoo they added pay-to-win' (which, i'll get in to later) and 'boo hoo hoo DLC :(((('. Well, ignore them. DLC is by no means as 'pay to win' as people make it out to be (well, the Courier pack sorta is, but whatever) and you can go extremely far in the game without them. I made it all the way to level 100 before dropping a dime on DLC. And as far as 'pay-to-win/microtransactions/i'm-blowing-a-minor-issue-out-of-proportion' goes, I think that the drill/crate system changes nothing. The stat boosts of the skins are so minor that they're downright inconsequential, and the only reason I ever bought any is because I wnated to see what the big fuss was about. Plus, and if I've said this once I've said it a thousand times, DRILLS ARE NOT ♥♥♥♥ING MICROTRANSACTIONS. OVERKILL does not sell drills anywhere (they formerly did and immediatley stopped), and if anything, the drill and crate system created a way for the community to monitor itself and buy and sell like any good capitalist would. So, I say to all you who cried like a babby once OVERKILL added in crates and drills: Shut up and shame on you for attacking the good name of this game.  TL;DR: Buy this game if you like good video games and have no problem wating for sales to happen.
