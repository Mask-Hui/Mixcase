Ok so i hate zombie games like really they are boring to me but this ♥♥♥♥ right here.. Pros: great world design story crafting parkur! actully scary at night.. Cons: skill tree is not so great after 3~4 hours of gameplay you get bored climing is still buggy in some parts... I rate 9/10 and im waiting for the dlc freat game overoll! good job to the creators!
