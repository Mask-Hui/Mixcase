Ok so i HATE zombie games like really they are boring to me but this ♥♥♥♥ right here..   Pros:  Great world design  Story  Crafting Parkur!  actully scary at night..   Cons:  skill tree is not so great  after 3~4 hours of gameplay you get bored climing is still buggy in some parts...   I rate 9/10  and im waiting for the DLC  freat game overoll! Good job to the creators!
