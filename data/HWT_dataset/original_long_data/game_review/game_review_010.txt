I was pretty underwhelmed with this game. I wouldn't really classify it as adventure, rpg, or simulation (as steam does) but indie and casual sure fit. It's just a digital choose choose-your-path book with an arbitrary and random mission selection element thrown in. Also, my first monster looked stupid.
