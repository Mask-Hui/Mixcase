I was pretty underwhelmed with this game. I wouldn't really classify it as Adventure, RPG, or Simulation (as Steam does) but Indie and Casual sure fit. It's just a digital choose Choose-Your-Path book with an arbitrary and random mission selection element thrown in. Also, my first monster looked stupid.
