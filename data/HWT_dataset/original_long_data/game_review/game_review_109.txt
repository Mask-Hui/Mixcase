The water is cool i will give them that but the fps on this game is sh$@. I don't know what the fps actually is but it dosnt seem like 60 and at times is like under 30 i think (yes my pc should be able to play this well past 60) it drops in places and dosnt run well in general which is fine if you have a high end pc but be warned. It loses save files which is sad because i'm not going to go back and redo somthing that i didnt enjoy that much in the first place. I dont think the game is bad to say but its not very clear on what to do or where to go. Theres lots of platforming stuff i don't think fits the game. I don't want to uber biased because i lost my save file. ( not sure how it got lost in the cloud i don't think it uplodes right honestly. I have come across countless buggs. The first cutscene is where it goes to $@#$. I don't usally write bad reviews but ive tryed this on a few dif computers and the buggs and framerate is the same even when testing it on a old computer. Theres not much positive to say honestly :( i can't recommend this at full price but for what i payed which was like 40 cents sure why not.
