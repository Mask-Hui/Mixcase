Great ww2 game ! but, comparing to coh 1 prequels has less to offer, the game engine is pretty the same and that's bad, for a 2013 game. Maybe, this coh 2 should be an expansion to the original coh 1. Come on, look to all the differences between starcraft 1 and 2 and even so, the community was not very satisfied.
