Fantastic strategy game. I find it a good compliment to Total War, as Total War focuses on the military aspect of things and pretty much assumes you have complete domestic control, whereas Crusader Kings 2 doesn't have a very good military system but the political and intrigue components are well beyond any other game out there.
