Warframe is a fun game for the first few hours of play. After those few enjoyable hours you'll begin to see that the only thing left the game has to offer is repetition in it's combat, enemies and game play. The one major high point for the game is that the developers are working hard and do semi-frequent updates that generally include a lot of content from sweeping changes to some of the game's systems, new warframes and other tweaks/features. It's a good game to play casually. Though i doubt it will hold your attention beyond a few months unless you just really like grinding. The upside to all of this is that the game is free so i'd recommend trying it out. If you're looking for a quick fix, try it out. There are better games out there.
