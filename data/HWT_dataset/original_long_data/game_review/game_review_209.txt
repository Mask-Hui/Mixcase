1000 amps is a neat little puzzle metroidvania. There are about 150 rooms in the game, each one has a variable amount of light nodes that you activate by touching. Each lit light node upgrades your jump height a bit, and if you manage to touch all of them in the room without leaving, they stay lit forever. After a few rooms you find your first power up, teleport, which changes the game (and puzzle) mechanics quite significantly. You see, while you can teleport freely, you require at least one lit light node to do so, and teleporting clears a 3x3 grid around you - so if you were standing on a light node, it will deactivate. The game keeps adding game and puzzle elements constantly, and barring one or two times i was stuck in a room (sadly, the game will not tell you outright if you have all the needed power ups to clear a room), it's been a joy to play so far.
