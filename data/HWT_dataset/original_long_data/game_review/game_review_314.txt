The beautiful artstyle with an innocent soundtrack really sets the mood for the game and really hooks you with continuing the story. The leveling and combat system is straight forward enough to allow for casual players to pick up easaly, but the timing mechanic weaved into the combat allows for precision mastery for more intermediate players. 15$ or below for this game would be a steal. 9/10
