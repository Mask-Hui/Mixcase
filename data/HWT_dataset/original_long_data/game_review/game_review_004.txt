Escape dead island is a spinoff game in the dead island series. It's a hack n' slash/ steath game which is in my opinion one of this years best games. I know that's a bold statment but the game's launch was good, it has a compelling story, and still manages ti have really good psychological horror themes ( it isn't scary at all ) but in summary this is one of those over looked games that is great 8.5/10
