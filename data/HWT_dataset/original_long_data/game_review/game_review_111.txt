Absolutely love the game but on a half decent machine im getting frame by fame fps on some fights on lowest settings. This is simply not acceptable. Trying to compete on the ladder when one hit means the difference between 1st and 5th position and i have to do bosses at 4 frames a second is more frustration than it is worth.
