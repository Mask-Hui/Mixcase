Good Game Vinci Games! Graphics and monsters are what I like most here. Graphical effects are huge advantage of this game, especially lights. Really scary atmosphere due to amazing sounds. Like weapons. I will definitely continue playing. For future, please optimize it a bit and fix few minor gameplay issues - will be cool.
