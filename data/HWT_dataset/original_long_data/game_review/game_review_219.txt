Really intresting games, i will buy for sure the DLCs when they will add some other thing to the game that seems unraveled to me ( still 2 rooms in the academy that cannot be opened )   By the way still a great game, great OST and great puzzles!! Well done devs, i'll be looking forward to your next works!!  TRY IT!
