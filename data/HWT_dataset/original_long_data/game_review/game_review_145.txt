Alright. Let me explain a few things, as a person very intrested in politics, I was very interested in this game when I first heard about it. I thought, 'Oh wow! A simulator of the road to becoming president! That sounds fun!' Well, it really wasn't.   The game starts you off and says you need to pick a side: republican or democrat, there is no independent, or third party. A little dissapointed, but still optimistic, I carried on to see what I could do.  I will give the game credit, the character customization, although limited, is pretty fun to mess around with. It's the only time its an option to wear your head or not in a campaign. Literally.  In the game, it gives you certain issues to deal with, which are understandable, and you decided how you feel about them. This part was ok.  An issue, however, was that it's a 1v1. There are only two competitors, 1 republican, 1 democrat. There was no mention of having multiple campaigners at the same time.  Another issue was something probably not intended, many times I experienced bugs which disabled me from continuing my turn, requiring me to leave the game and then reenter in order to continue.  And the last and final issue: the game just doesn't seem that interesting. Sure, I bet some people love it. Myself, I could only contain my excitement for one game. After that, it's easy to lose interest.  It is notable that I may be a LITTLE biased because I lost the election by electoral vote, not popular vote, to Hillary Clinton (Screw you Hillary) because of California (you too, California, you traitor) which switched on me at the last minute, but all in all, I don't recommend this game. If you enjoy it, sure, go ahead and do so. Just beware those purple states. Those will hit you hardest.  Don't buy this game, it's not worth it in my opinion. Use that $10 on what's really important: Buying electoral votes.
