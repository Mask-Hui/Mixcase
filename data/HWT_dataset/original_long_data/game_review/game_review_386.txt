Sid meier's civilization beyond earth is a turn-based game in which you build your civilization to a certain goal or 'victory'. In previous games you were set on the earth's timeline going through periods like the stone age, medieval age, and the modern age; however, in this game you are set in the future on a mission to colonize a new planet. What i enjoy about this game is 2k took a new approach to the game and added some new mechanics such as the affinity system and orbital layer. What i didn't enjoy was that with these new mechanics the game could be overwhelming at times. What think could be improved on this game is that they could maybe incorperate some new artwork in the game such as the enviroment you experience when communicating with another leader. If you enjoy a slower paced, immersive strategy experience, then this is the game for you. -4/5 seige worms
