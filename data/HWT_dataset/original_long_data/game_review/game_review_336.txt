If you can overlook the bugs (which I personally only had two: one minor and the other quite annoying)  EDIT: both bugs are resolved one fix increased my fps from 60-90 to 80-120  and are looking for a space exploration game, I can definitely recommend this.   Since most of these reviews are about specs, I'll include mine:  i5 6600K (~200€) Radeon RX480 (~200€)  Z170 Pro - Gaming (~150€) 16GB DDR4 Ram (~70€)  ~650€ is definitely within the medium price range though, granted, this rig is quite new.  almost constant 60+ fps on high settings vsync enabled  I genuinely can't believe 90% of the comments saying they're rocking an overkill setup and get 20fps.   I have no doubt that the bugs will be fixed within a certain timeframe.  There are a few things I would have expected to be a little different but all in all it provides a very unique and chill exploration experience.
