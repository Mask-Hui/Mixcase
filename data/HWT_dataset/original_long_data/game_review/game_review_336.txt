If you can overlook the bugs (which i personally only had two: one minor and the other quite annoying) edit: both bugs are resolved one fix increased my fps from 60-90 to 80-120 and are looking for a space exploration game, i can definitely recommend this. Since most of these reviews are about specs, i'll include mine: i5 6600k (~200€) radeon rx480 (~200€) z170 pro - gaming (~150€) 16gb ddr4 ram (~70€) ~650€ is definitely within the medium price range though, granted, this rig is quite new. Almost constant 60+ fps on high settings vsync enabled i genuinely can't believe 90% of the comments saying they're rocking an overkill setup and get 20fps. I have no doubt that the bugs will be fixed within a certain timeframe. There are a few things i would have expected to be a little different but all in all it provides a very unique and chill exploration experience.
