Tldr: buy on a sale but totally worth it. Great music, art, and story. A little short but the scare was lost to me about 60% of the way through the game so that might have been a good thing that the game was short. Dlc was maybe 30 minutes at max and i went into every room. Would love them to make a simlar game just add more 'twists' and not give away the story so soon.
