Screw Jesus; this game was 30 minutes long with most of it being load times and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ live action footage of a 'story'. And the gameplay sure as hell does not make up for it. I hope this game was a joke, because the only reason anyone would buy it is for a joke. Someone gifting it to me like it's Bad Rats is a clear sign of that.
