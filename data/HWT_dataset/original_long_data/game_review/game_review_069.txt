I have spent many hours playing this game as it is a thouroughly enjoyable tactical and strategic syfi game. In fact I have gone to the trouble of learning how to hack the game and change various objects. The game doesnt have a huge array of objects so I really hate when values make certian objects irrivelent, for example Exalt laser weapons are really cool looking in compairson to the clunky versions of XCOM's laser weapons so they are now one point better than Plasma weapons which makes them very valuable and creates a fourth tier weapons. Some may debate that it's cheating but up the difficulty level and it becomes enrichment.  Right now it is unclear wheather Fraxis is working on what is a mojor expansion or perhaps XCOM2, But they have made it clear it is their 'Next big project' and it is a continuation of XCOM EU/EW. I eagerly lookforward to what they have in-store for us fans!
