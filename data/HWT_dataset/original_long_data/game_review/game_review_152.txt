My stats (at the time of writing this review): - 8.6 hrs to get to the end - 10 collectibles found out of 25 - zero achievements out of 15 what i liked: - visuals up until the last level (ice caves) - story is not that great, but the ending (after the closing credits) kind of made me not regret so much spending my time playing this game what i disliked: - visuals in the last level are uninteresting - gameplay in the last level gets much harder making it become a frustrating experience of having to do a lot of things over and over again until you get it right - achievements are too hard. There are 13 (out of 15) that only less than 2,1% of players achieved! replayability: - i'm not really into playing games over and over again just because of collectibles and achievements but because the game is pleasing and fun. Since the last level (ice caves) got on my nerves i'm definitely not playing it again. Recommending the game or not: i hate it when games become a frustrating experience. I don't think that a precise timing to push buttons makes a game fun.
