My first impressions were pretty 'bleh' for the game. That said i came back and played again later and found the game simple but enjoyable. In terms of pacing and 'realism' it is like game dev tycoon. This does not give you any idea of the real world. But as just a fun time waster? a mobile style game that works well on pc? yeah.
