Who wouldn't want to wear a fez? :d this puzzle platforming game stars a little guy with a fez who goes around collecting little bits to form a cube and navigating through a fairly large branching map. This game is quite amusing and running through it to complete the game was quite a bit of fun. ^_^ it can become semi-frustrating if you want to get all the cubes and achievements though. To get all the cubes you'll need to crack codes that you'll have to decipher. These can take a few seconds or frustrate you into looking into a guide (*raises hand* i gave up. -_-). The guide, 'a complete guide to fez!!!' by daawesomenerd http://store.steampowered.com is fantastic and super helpful/easy to follow. But if you think about it long enough and really like challenging puzzles i bet you can get them yourself. :) as far as replayability, i personally think it can be somewhat replayable (because of the codes), but since you have been through everything once you may want to give it some time before you play it again. Definitely worth the ~$4 i spent on it though. :) hope you enjoy the game! :d this took me about 10 hours to complete and i'm not a hardcore gamer, but i do like puzzles. I also used the guide for most of the codes because i couldn't get them myself. :( so use that info on maybe determining how long it would take you? otherwise this section is just useless info and you just read my ramblings. :p sorry!
