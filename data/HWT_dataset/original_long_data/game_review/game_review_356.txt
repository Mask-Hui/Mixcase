Do I even need to explain why Portal is amazing? Portal is a puzzle game, it gives you a concept then gets out. It is an amazing way to test your mind while still being fun. Although this game isn't as story heavy, it did give birth to one of the most GOOD popular games of 2011. I still play this game and beat it when I am feeling bored and I love to come back and to see what gave birth to a legend and what is a legend.   Gameplay: Portal's gameplay is quite simple, to explain at least. You use portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate a part of the puzzle. Two buttons are in the game, one that you press and one that you need a cube to put on. There are also lift pads is what I will call them, they take you across the map. Also, there are energy balls (xdxdxd) that kill you if you are hit by one. Lastly, there is DEADLY GOO!! Simple, you fall in, you die. Easy. Not so easy.   Story: To be honest not much story is in this Portal game. Well, at the time. Now theories are everywhere because of the second installment. Anyway, the story basically is that you are a test subject that volunteered a long time ago to test some new gadgets the factory was making. Then GLADOS, the AI that you fight against went rouge and killed everyone working there. You, now go through HER tests and then end up -SSPPOOIILLEERRSS-  Conclusion: Buy Portal.
