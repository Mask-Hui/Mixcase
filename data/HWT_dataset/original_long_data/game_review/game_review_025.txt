Story: the story revolves around hikaru, who mysteriously gets body swapped with his two crushes after a strange headache. He is now tasked with fixing their lives, or he might never get back to his own body! art: the art is well done and the style is consistent, there are a decent number of cg's that art doesn't feel re-used unless when necessary. Length: this visual novel will take you around 1.5-2 hours to complete soundtrack: the soundtrack is decent, there are a couple of tracks that sound good on their own, everything syncs up with the mood of the scene. Overall: i would recommend highscool possession to fans of slice of life or mystery vn's. It has an interesting story that compels you to complete it, and contains multiple endings.
