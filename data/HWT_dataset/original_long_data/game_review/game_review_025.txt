Story:    The story revolves around Hikaru, who mysteriously gets body swapped with his two crushes after a strange headache. He is now tasked with fixing their lives, or he might never get back to his own body!    Art:   The art is well done and the style is consistent, there are a decent number of CG's that art doesn't feel re-used unless when necessary.    Length:    This visual novel will take you around 1.5-2 hours to complete    Soundtrack:    The soundtrack is decent, there are a couple of tracks that sound good on their own, everything syncs up with the mood of the scene.    Overall:   I would recommend Highscool Possession to fans of slice of life or mystery VN's. It has an interesting story that compels you to complete it, and contains multiple endings.
