I loved the original ROTT. None of my friends ever played it, or had even heard of it. I slogged through all the levels, mused at the hilariously over-the-top violence, insanely ridiculous but satisfying weapons, and excellent MIDI score, as well as clever gameplay mechanics of El Oscuro, the final boss. Of course I was stoked when the rumours of a ROTT remake came true.  I really wish I could say I loved this game. It's a great homage, but halfway through it begins to fall apart. Terrible glitches, insanely buggy architecture and errors that force you to constantly restart (even going so far as to penalize you for quick loading), anti-climactic boss fights that are a consistent letdown...I'm almost at the point where I regret buying it. I regret telling my friends about it. The Oscuro boss fight was an utter joke of a slogfest, something akin to the devs pounding your face into a brick wall painted with broken glass. It wasn't interesting, just a ♥♥♥♥ing pain in the ♥♥♥ marathon of bad game design.  Suffice it to say I will not be buying any of their subsequent games. I loved you, Apogee, but you broke my heart for the last time.
