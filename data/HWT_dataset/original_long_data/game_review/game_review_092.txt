Awesome atmospheric space horror FPS game and one of the scariest I have ever played (together with Dead Space), the darkness in it is literally unseen anywhere else and the feeling of despair totally gets you, needless to say you even visit Hell at some point.  The variety of scary demons coming from Hell to halt your progress is impressive, but even more impressive is the variety of weapons you get to stop them: from classic pistols, shotguns and machine guns (with my favorite being the double-barreled shotgun, found only in the expansion, Resurrection of Evil, though) to awesome futuristic weapons like the Plasma Gun, Grabber Gun (again found only in the expansion) and my personal favorite: the Big ♥♥♥♥ing Gun or BFG, as it is commonly known!  Unlike it's two predecessors, which were less scary and more fast-paced mindless shooters, Doom 3 inverted these two factors, resulting in a slower and scarier FPS game. While still remaining awesome, it is not for the everyone and especially the weak of heart.  For a more hardcore and immersive experience you can also play it alone, in a dark and silent room, just remember to check your sanity once in a while!
