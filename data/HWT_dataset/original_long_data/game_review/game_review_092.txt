Fun and addicting game, often found that I lost track of time while playing. You kind of get that Super Smash Bros feel with the unlockable characters which drives you to play more and each character has their own unique stats and skills to further increase incentive to get them.  There's plenty of replayability however I don't feel the game is worth the full price of $10. There is simply not enough content to market this game at that price since there are only 10 characters and once you have all of them unlocked your only reason to play is to unlock the other power-ups that have a chance of spawning or Monster Logs for some lore on the monsters you're fighting.  I recommend this game only if it's on sale.
