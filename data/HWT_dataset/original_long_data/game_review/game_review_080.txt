I'll admitt i wasnt sure what i was thinking when i bought this game. In fact, i remember being pretty certain i was wasting my money, and judging from the trailer i was about to waste some good money on a glorified spot the difference game. Thankfully i was both undeterred and wrong. This game is seriously addictive, with a constantly changing set of rules, reoccuring characters, intense story and high pressure moments that you can only hope to keep up with, rather than prepare for. I find myself more and more these days being sucked into indie games rather than aaa titles, and it's because of games like papers, please that this is happening. I'm spending a fraction of my money on a more in-depth story and experience whilst getting something much more replayable. As a result i'm getting much more use of games like this per pound/dollar/euro spent. If you're getting to this stage in your gaming life too, then papers, please is perfect for you. Get through the first few beginner days and experience the pressure of all the checks you need to do all whilst attempting to maintain a quota of customers in a day so you can feed your family. And remember: trust no-one!
