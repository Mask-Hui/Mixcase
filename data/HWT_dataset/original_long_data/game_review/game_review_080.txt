This game was a surprising gem. One often sees rave reviews of certain products that are often misleading. In this case, the reviews reflect the fun of this neat little game. It is an odd mix between a classic 2d platformer and an moba, and does it with style. I found myself enjoying characters that i wouldn't enjoy in other moba games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a go anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked from playing games. The art style and interface is oddly charming. As such, i now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game. As for the audio, the voice acting is grin-worthy, with music and effects adding to the 80's cartoon vibe.
