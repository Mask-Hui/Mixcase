Ah, Zenozoik! How I love to wander your bizarro lands, taste your hallucinogenic sweat - and beat the crap out of your adorably crazy inhabitants.  Couple of hours to complete, possibly years of love and inspiration. Seriously, Zeno Clash simply breathes creativity. Like your favourite choice of stimulant it invades your imagination and has you craving for more...but without all the unfortunate side-effects!  Notice also that it is an astonishingly fun 1st-person beat'em up - haven't seen many of those around.  +Style: Interactive Art! +Soul: Would go on vacation there. Also I am kinda in love with Deadra. +Fun: Buddy and Terry in Wonderland. -Content: Doing well but not doing much.
