There are many old school (sounds corny) shooters out there but rise of the triad is one of the best. Here's why. First there is a points system so you can set yourself up higher. You can also do this with the achievements. You get points based on the coins you find, how well you kill enemies, and the difficulty you are playing on. Second it's challenging. This mostly comes from the traps at first (leon s kennedy probably played this game before rescuing ashley in europe) but later on you find yourself facing tougher enemies. You will feel satisfied when you beat the final boss. Third you are encouraged to use powerful weapons. Frequently you will find a powerful weapon that has about 8 shots. So you will these shots immedieatly instead of saving it because you will more than likely find another powerful weapon a minute later. Theres also plenty of fun powerups and powerdowns fourth it has autosaves so you don't have to predict how the level is gonna be and use a quicksave in a bad spot (quicksaves give a penalty) this game is different because it requires you to dodge traps. Once you get used to it you will have the reflexes of a quicktime event. So if you are looking for an old school shooter try this one out. You will only be dissapointed if you don't like a challenge (you can always try easy)
