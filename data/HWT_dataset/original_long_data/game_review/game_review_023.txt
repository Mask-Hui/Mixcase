Excellent game, very addictive, especially with friends but the ranking system is utterly broken!  Please Psyonix copy the ranking system of CS:Go and skip this linear ranking system which gets abused by smurfers and on-purpose-downrankers !     &gt;&gt;&gt; How it works now:  High rank + Low rank (two friends in the same lobby, one player is downranking on purpose by leaving matches with foreign players) will end up with low-mid rank enemies.    &gt;&gt;&gt; How it should be:   High rank + low rank = high rank enemies    Today they reset the ranks of all players, great job Psyonix! Have fun playing against Allstar opponents, as a silver guy.
