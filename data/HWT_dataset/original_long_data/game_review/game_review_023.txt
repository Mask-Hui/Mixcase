Excellent game, very addictive, especially with friends but the ranking system is utterly broken! please psyonix copy the ranking system of cs:go and skip this linear ranking system which gets abused by smurfers and on-purpose-downrankers ! &gt;&gt;&gt; how it works now: high rank + low rank (two friends in the same lobby, one player is downranking on purpose by leaving matches with foreign players) will end up with low-mid rank enemies. &gt;&gt;&gt; how it should be: high rank + low rank = high rank enemies today they reset the ranks of all players, great job psyonix! have fun playing against allstar opponents, as a silver guy.
