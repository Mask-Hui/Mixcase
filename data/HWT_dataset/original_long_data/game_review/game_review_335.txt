I'm really sorry, i try to be supportive of free-to-play games and indie developers, but i really didn't enjoy this game. The description sounded right up my alley, but the execution has done nothing for me. I love puzzle and exploration games, but i found this game to be completely unintuitive, and even after looking up how to progress i still just simply didn't find the gameplay itself fun. It also completely lacks a pause button, or if it does have one i never found it. Considering that a lot of sequences in the game are timed, this seems like a critical oversight. I also feel like this game is a lot more cut scene than it is game, and i end up just sitting around drumming my fingers a lot. I may come back to this game some other time for another shot, but at least as of now, it's left a very bad taste in my mouth.
