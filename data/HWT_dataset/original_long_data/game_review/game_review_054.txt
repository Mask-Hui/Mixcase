As an average dota2 player, the best advice i can give for anyone who wants to play this game is... Don't, don't even consider it. Dota2 is bad for your general well-being. You know should stop playing dota2 when: 4/10 of your dreams involve some sort of dota2 reference. You actually use phrases like 'gg' and 'wp' outside the game you are warning people not to play it, like it's some sort of disease. You actually start to consider learning russian so you can enjoy the game more. You actually consider moving to russia (no offence to russia) you know every item, hero and play style in game till a new meta is revelled. You have spent more time on dota2 in a day then you’ve slept, eaten and worked in. You see yourself getting dumber. There is only one real benefit of playing dota2, and that is it the simple fact that nobody in your entire life with be able to ♥♥♥♥ you off because you’ve experienced playing this game. Lost your job? shrug it off. House burnt down? no biggy. Lost both your job and your home? it’s just banter. You’ll never be angry again, it just won’t happen. You’ll lose the ability to be mad, it may even upset you. Dota will have you so mad, upset and confused that you’ll just stop caring. No game should be able to do this.
