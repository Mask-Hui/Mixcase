I played this for less than 2 hours and won't be playing it again. I bought it on the recommendation of some friends but unfortunately it's not my type of game. I can definitely see its appeal for certain people, however it was a frustrating game for me precisely because you cannot save your progress and that it's about seeing how long you can survive. I'm not good at those sorts of games, so if you're like me don't buy this.
