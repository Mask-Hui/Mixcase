Amazing game. I donâ€™t recall any other game in the last few years that glued me to the monitor for so many hours. This game is similar to jagged alliance series and heroes of m&amp;m iii (turn based combination, but in many aspects unique). This is not another hyped one day game - it is complicated, rich in choices and quests, addictive and rich in plot story. I recommend this game particularly to all fans of pirates/caribbean/16th &amp; 17th century exploration lovers.
