So apparently, the people who made this VN were big fans of key, it was pretty fun to see all those references.  Cons- Definetly falls short compared to big companies VNs, as the choices provide nothing to the story and the general storyline is very confusing. I also feel they built up so much story... for something not that big of a deal. But ah well, that might just be me who's spoiled by big companies' VNs.  Pros- Beautiful artstyle that I found really cute and unique, relaxing music, and half a comical story with lots of VNs and animes references.   Also the diary part after you finally get to the ending helps a lot understanding the actual plot.    It's a cute read if you enjoy short love stories.
