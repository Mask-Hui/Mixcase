So apparently, the people who made this vn were big fans of key, it was pretty fun to see all those references. Cons- definetly falls short compared to big companies vns, as the choices provide nothing to the story and the general storyline is very confusing. I also feel they built up so much story... For something not that big of a deal. But ah well, that might just be me who's spoiled by big companies' vns. Pros- beautiful artstyle that i found really cute and unique, relaxing music, and half a comical story with lots of vns and animes references. Also the diary part after you finally get to the ending helps a lot understanding the actual plot. It's a cute read if you enjoy short love stories.
