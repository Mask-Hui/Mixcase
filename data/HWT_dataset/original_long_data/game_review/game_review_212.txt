Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember (at least in the uk) watching the ever-irritating timmy mallet just for the five minute transformers cartoon. The voice actors for optimus, megatron, bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognisable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very generation one. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike high moon's excellent war for/fall of cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g. Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster. There are plenty of side missions available, and some of the main game's brief forays into side-scroller, gta1 top-down, and take-out-the-horde-with-a-turret-gun are nice changes of pace.
