♥♥♥♥♥♥ resolutions, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ textures, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ engine, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port. ♥♥♥♥ story, decent gameplay, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ attack animations for some attacks, enemy AI is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ too.  I'm not all too sure what it does to make up for all its ♥♥♥♥♥iness, but it still a decent game when bought at 5 bucks. Anything above that is a ♥♥♥♥ing rip off though. I feel bad for anyone that paid full price for this. So it mediocre overall, buy it if you're bored and have some money to spend I guess.
