Best strategy game ever made. Nothing even comes close to how good this game is in scale, control scheme, realism, and thoughtful gameplay.  Playing this game should be a mandatory part of high school education. It illustrates in no uncertain terms just how important it is to perserve the peace in the world. When you see squads of infantry with names and faces getting turned into minced meat by 203mm artillery because you ordered them to hold a town at all costs... ... That will make you think twice about voting for stupid politicians and supporting militarist and nationalist policies.
