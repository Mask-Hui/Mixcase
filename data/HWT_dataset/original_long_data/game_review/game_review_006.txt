For the most part i love this game, but jesus it can be frustrating. I wouldn't even care about the difficulty if it made sense. Viable tactic: stand in front of door and murder everyone who walks through as the bodies pile up and no one's aware. Non-viable tactic: try to quietly sneak up on a guy with a knife for a quiet takedo- 360 noscoped shotugn takedown get owned soooooon i have esp don't you ever try 'n sneak up on me boy ugh...
