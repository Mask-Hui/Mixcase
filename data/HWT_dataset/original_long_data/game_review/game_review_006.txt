The Good    very strong atmosphere; the visuals, the sound and the writing complement each other in creating an atmosphere that is not only eerie and scary, but also very sad and occasionally disturbing   jumping off of the previous point, the writing in this game was a big surprise for me; while there isn't much of a main story going on at all, the way the conversations with the lost souls slowly reveal the most horrible things about the persons' lives was very intriguing and often quite chilling   exceptionally well done in-game log; information on anything and everything you come across in the game, be it NPCs, scrap notes or dug up items, is saved permanently in your log, with a description and an indicator that tells you whether or not you've already discovered everything there is to discover about it; very useful, especially later on when you re-visit old locations   the 'Listen' mechanic, which helps you find your way around the forest to all the points of interest related to any ongoing investigation, is pretty unique and had me engaged with the game in a way that a sole reliance on the map wouldn't have     The Meh    while I did enjoy the design of the 'daytime' enemies, the wraiths and the spectres, I felt like having comically cliched skeletons and giant spiders attack you at night was both, a bit lazy and, sadly, detrimental to the serious tone and otherwise dreary atmosphere of the game    I didn't enjoy the combat too much; taking out enemies from a distance is okay, but once they gang up on you (which happens frequently, and especially the nightly spawns cannot be sneaked up upon), it all turns into an often frustrating mess; a big part of the problem is that the AI often resorts to simply running straight towards you, attempting to hurt you with melee attacks, while you try your best to keep them at a distance with an arsenal of (deliberately) slow, ranged weapons; you do have a melee attack of your own, but it's depressingly inefficient, as are the explosives you find, which will often do splash damage to yourself or simply miss the quickly approaching and dodging enemy entirely; there's a 'last resort' type of weapon in the form of a very deadly tomahawk, but those are in extremely short supply (by the end of the game, I was able to carry only a maximum of three)   I wish the actual investigations were a bit more involving than just picking up clues that are strewn all across the forest; maybe the dialog system could have been made a bit more complex with multiple dialog trees and investigative questioning     The Ugly    I feel like Betrayer's biggest problem is that it quickly gives off the impression that the developers were padding things out; the 7 main maps could have easily been compressed to 5 or even just 4, with multiple investigations per map and fewer 'filler' chests and buried treasures; I sometimes felt like I was doing busywork, which truly hurt the sense of immersion that's so crucial to the enjoyment of this game      Overall  Betrayer was a pleasant surprise for me. I don't know what I was expecting, really, but it certainly wasn't something so engrossing and well-written as this. It's a bit of a shame that the game overstays its welcome by a few hours, since the most fun I had was early on when I was figuring out the mechanics of this strange world and unraveling its mysteries. Later on, I often found myself just checking all the spots on the map in order to move on. However, I will say that the final map and its related investigation managed to bring back much of the game's initial charme and atmosphere. I just wish they had cut out some of the filler in the middle.  Either way, though, as far as spooky indie games go, this is a big 'Recommend', with the hopes for a tighter Betrayer II that focuses much more on the investigations.  Also, I noticed that many commenters have criticized the game's ending for being a letdown. I don't really agree. The ending (both in terms of plot resolution and gameplay) is pretty much in line with the rest of the game, in my opinion. .:very mild, nonspecific spoiler:.   It doesn't answer any big questions, but the game never leads you on to believe that it ever will.
