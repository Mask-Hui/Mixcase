For the most part I love this game, but Jesus it can be frustrating. I wouldn't even care about the difficulty if it made sense. Viable tactic: stand in front of door and murder everyone who walks through as the bodies pile up and no one's aware. Non-viable tactic: Try to quietly sneak up on a guy with a knife for a quiet takedo- 360 Noscoped shotugn takedown GET OWNED SOOOOOON I HAVE ESP DON'T YOU EVER TRY 'N SNEAK UP ON ME BOY Ugh...
