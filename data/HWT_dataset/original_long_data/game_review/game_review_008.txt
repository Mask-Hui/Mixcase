In previous Dishonored 1, it is just Corvo but i played several time to find the best route in each district. As for Dishonored 2, either Corvo and Emily can be selected to play throughout the gameplays in different style of assasination and shealth. The storyline is still rich while i played till mission 4 and lots of routes can be chosen to reach the primary goal. This is basically Dishonored trademark.  I do not realise the new patch had installed in the game while i played the game. The performance seems smoother as i played last two days ago. No crash at all in my current settings (not high settings) from previous patch till now. The main screen of Corvo and Emily also look a bit sharper as previously and smoother performance. Everything is great so far. I hope it will stay like till the end.
