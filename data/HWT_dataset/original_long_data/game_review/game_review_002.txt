Not worth the money, all of the features you wanted didn't make it into the game. It comes down grinding boring gameplay to make your inventory in your various equipment bigger. The mountains are hills the oceans are lakes, the animals all behave the same. Nothing is on an actual universal scale except my disappointment.
