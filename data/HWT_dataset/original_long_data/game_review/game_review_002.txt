I was skeptical on purchasing this game because I never was really a bit MMO fan. I really did like Skyrim, and heard this wasn't exactly the same, but similar.  I am pleasently suprised. Great combat system. You got the whole hack and slash like Skyrim then hot keys for your spells. Makes you feel like a battle mage. I always hated how much you had to switch your equoment around in Skyrim and this game fixes that issue I had.  You still get the same feel of doing what you want and leveling up for it instead of just spending points on skills for leveling. Really gives you an option to try new things. For each class there is a few routes you can take for it, and you can use whatever weapon you want for it. Basically you get to play the character you want to play instead of feeling stuck into a role. You also get rewarded for playing your hand to hand combat skills which I like. It's not just a bunch of clicking on hot keys.  The quests are nice and comparable to Skyrim as well. There is stories that fit into the lore, and avoid doing the whole collect this many or kill this many creatures.  Graphics are pretty nice as well. You'll notice it is a lot less 'cluteered' than Skymin, but I kind of expected that from a MMO.  Can't wait to play more.  Thumbs up.
