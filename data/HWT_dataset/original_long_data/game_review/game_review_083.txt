Classic games, pretty fun if you like RPGs, I suck so I had to use the supercharge mode and stuff like that so atleast they have that in there for noobs. Tidus is a great bloke and quite a good character. FFX-2 is kinda weird but it's still pretty good    kind of annoying though how you only get to see Tidus again if you get a perfect ending    overall pretty damn good games and I'd recommend em.
