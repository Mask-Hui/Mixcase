Classic games, pretty fun if you like rpgs, i suck so i had to use the supercharge mode and stuff like that so atleast they have that in there for noobs. Tidus is a great bloke and quite a good character. Ffx-2 is kinda weird but it's still pretty good kind of annoying though how you only get to see tidus again if you get a perfect ending overall pretty damn good games and i'd recommend em.
