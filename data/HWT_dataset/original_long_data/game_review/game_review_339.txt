I'm 2 hours in and am dying from this game. SO FUNNY. Gameplay is also solid, art design is beautiful, music is surprisingly high quality and appropriate, the story/world has me interested, and the puzzles are fun. But the best thing about this game beyond all that is the comedy. If you've played any RPG since the dawn of video game RPGs you will laugh at the various jokes, parodies, and references; if you've never played an RPG before then you should still enjoy the game for its humor. If you played Final Fantasy 7 or X you absolutely need to play this game, without giving too much away...  I had to actually stop playing after 2 hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much.  What a delight so far. I'm excited to keep playing--the only thing I dread is that this game might end long before I'm ready for it to. But that might be more of my wanting this game and humor to go on forever.  UPDATE: Finished the game. What a delightful ride. The combat wasn't always great but I'd give it a solid 7/10 throughout. Let's be honest--you aren't playing this game for the gameplay so much. You're here for the jokes. And on that front, this game delivers big time.
