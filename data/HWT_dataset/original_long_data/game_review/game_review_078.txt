So far, I have to admit the game is fairly addictive and fun. I enjoy the flexability of being able to build out some of the units and the quests. I also like how you can better balance the play. It is like a cross between Civ and Might and Magic heroes, as another person stated. It also does combine the best features of both. I would recommend the game only if you have patience. If you do not like to wait for things to build or are addicted to instant action, then this is not the game for you. However, if your patient and you plan your actions accordingly, the game is very rewarding.
