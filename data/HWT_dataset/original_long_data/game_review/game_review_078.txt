I played this game back in the early stages. It was laggy and repetetive with no progression. Now it's a fairly fun hacky/slashy game. If you like RWBY then this game is probably worth the price. Otherwise there are cheaper alternatives. Darksiders maybe? I've never played it but it's usualy on sale for about $5.00.  Although if this game implemented a good weapon customizer it might be worth the $25.00 tag to non-rwby fans.  -  P.S. Plox implement Neo.
