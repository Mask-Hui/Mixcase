I was playing as franklin (the black character) and standing in front of policemen. After standing there for 20 seconds, the police started to shoot and arrest me when i was harmlessly looking at them. I really like the way gta 5's ai is so advanced and relevent to the way things actually work in real life (sarcasm)
