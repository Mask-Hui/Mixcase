I was playing as Franklin (The Black Character) and standing in front of policemen. After standing there for 20 seconds, the police started to shoot and arrest me when I was harmlessly looking at them. I really like the way GTA 5's AI is so advanced and relevent to the way things actually work in real life (Sarcasm)
