(1/5) Where to start... Okay, this game is only okay in my mind. There is a lot of hype for the ACreed Series that just doesn't seem to hold up to the expectations that the games are put up to. I can easily see that a lot of work was put into this game, but the controls feel way off and need to be reset and even then it is difficult to understand how to do some of the things.
