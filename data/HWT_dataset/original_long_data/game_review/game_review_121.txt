The game is awsome, no doubt about it, perfect rpg. But it freezes my entire system after one specific fight in chapter 4, it´s really disappointing not beeing able to finish the game because of that, i have all the recomended system requirements, but loading takes too long and this one cutscene appears to be requiring more memory than recomended. I dont know... Seems like many people are having these sort of problems but i´ll change my review to positive if someone helps me fix it
