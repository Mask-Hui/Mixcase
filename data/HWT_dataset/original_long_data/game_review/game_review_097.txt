Had problems playing it. lower FOV and it got a minor headach. Expanded the FOV and started to get a bar going across the middle of the screen. On top fo that the controls just eel like made for a controler when using M+KB. Switched to my controler and the camera kept moving weird. Maybe a good game for others but it doesn't agree with me.
