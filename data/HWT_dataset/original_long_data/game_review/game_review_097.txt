Had problems playing it. Lower fov and it got a minor headach. Expanded the fov and started to get a bar going across the middle of the screen. On top fo that the controls just eel like made for a controler when using m+kb. Switched to my controler and the camera kept moving weird. Maybe a good game for others but it doesn't agree with me.
