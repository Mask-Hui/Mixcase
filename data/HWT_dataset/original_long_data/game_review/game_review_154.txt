I really enjoyed this game. It drops you into a land where you know nothing and the story gradually unveils, and you slowly learn about your past and who you were. This game is less of a horror game, and more like a mystery thriller. You do not need cheap jumpscares and loud noises to make the game creepy, as Port of Call demonstrates. The ending leaves you in awe, and makes you wish that there was more to play. This game really demonstrates the interactive level all games should come down to, and other games should learn from this one, as the experience is one I will never forget.
