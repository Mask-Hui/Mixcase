I played this game on the ps3, it is nothing compared to the pc. Two more NPC's, fishing, more armor and content. This is for those people who love mine craft but wan't a better challenge. Constant update notice on the terraia website as well as consistent feed back from the devs making it a good game to both play and talk about. I especially enjoy the rarity in some items and creativeness of the community, where only the sky is the limit and fun is imminent. Must play 10/10.
