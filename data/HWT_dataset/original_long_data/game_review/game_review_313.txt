I had originally bought this game in early development, when the only currency was spacebux, and there was no 'Tech Tree'. This was when the game was good. All of the guns at this point were equally overpowered, so there was no problems with imbalance; Everyone could kill everyone at any time. Also, the game used to give you UNLIMITED GUN SLOTS and five loadouts. You would think that for a game with 'Bajillions of guns', they would at least give you more than 6 weapon slots and 3 loadouts before you have to pay to get more. At one point, I had about 3 pages worth of guns, and was planning on new ideas for more, because personally, that's where I found it fun. When finishing a match, you were either awarded with an XP boost, extra spacebux, or a gun part. It was a beautiful system which in my opinion should have never been changed.  Today's Loadout is rife with awful development choices, like the horribly sluggish tech tree and the addition of another in-game currency known as 'Blutes'. In all honesty, the game would have been better, had they just kept it paid past early development.  Also, if you're a new player, you may as well forget about it, because though they offer blute rewards for bot matches, they're reduced, making it very difficult for you to compete against anybody who has better guns and higher ranked weapons parts than you.  In summary; What used to be an amazing game has been flipped upside down and ruined by 'fixing' game systems that were never broken in the first place. Don't waste your time.
