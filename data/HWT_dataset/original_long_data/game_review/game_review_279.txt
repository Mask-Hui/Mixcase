I just started playing, but I love this game.   I put on my headphone and lose myself in the game for hours at a time. It's been awhile since a game has had that effect on me. The music sets the mood, the sound effects are right on, and the controls are perfect. I look forward to every combat, and they've optimized combat extremely well. I had my doubt about the navel combat system, but it is so much fun to lay waste to multiple fleets at a time! The only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat looks overwhelming just get outta there, regroup, and counter-assault.   Thanks, devs, for an awesome experience!
