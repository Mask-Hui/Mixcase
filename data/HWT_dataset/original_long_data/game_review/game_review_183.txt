Everyone who like Third Person shooters should get this game. It's one of the best around.  It pays great homage to G1 with references that bring back the nostalgia.  I see people complaining about multiplayer being broken and the DLC being unnecessary and ♥♥♥♥ but who cares. This game is worth the price alone.
