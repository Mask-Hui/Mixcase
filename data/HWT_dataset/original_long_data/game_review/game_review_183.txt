Everyone who like third person shooters should get this game. It's one of the best around. It pays great homage to g1 with references that bring back the nostalgia. I see people complaining about multiplayer being broken and the dlc being unnecessary and ♥♥♥♥ but who cares. This game is worth the price alone.
