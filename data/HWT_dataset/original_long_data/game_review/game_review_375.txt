Probably the best story in a game i've ever played, and i've played a lot of games! the only problems i have are it felt a little short (do as much exploring as possible to extend game time, i finished it in 11 hours with a little exploration), and that i can't get my memory wiped by the men in black to experience the story for the first time ever again. Buy it. Now.
