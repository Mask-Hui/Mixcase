Probably the best story in a game I've ever played, and I've played A LOT of games! The only problems I have are it felt a little short (do as much exploring as possible to extend game time, I finished it in 11 hours with a little exploration), and that I can't get my memory wiped by the men in black to experience the story for the first time ever again. Buy it. Now.
