I've heard that civ:be is a bit too much like civilization v. I don't care about that. I only care that it's a fun game, and it is. It has all the things i like about civilization games... And some of the bad things too. I can build a mighty empire. I can do it peacefully, or battle my opponents. I can coexist with aliens, or wipe them out. I can pick from five different victory conditions to pursue, each with interesting advantages and disadvantages. On the downside, starting positions can still be extremely unfair, just like all the previous civilization games. I can start one game in a large expanse of prime territory, with no adversaries nearby; and i can start another surrounded by aliens, with my expansion blocked by canyons, mountains, and other factions. This can make for very interesting variety, but it can also be very frustrating. Oh, and diplomacy can be just as annoying as other civilization games. Overall, the great things about the game offset the bad, at least for my enjoyment. Expansions should make the game even better.
