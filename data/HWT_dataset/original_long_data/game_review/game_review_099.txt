I can be skeptical when buying indie games. On one hand, I want to help small developers but, on the other, I want to make sure it is a solid, finished product I am getting. Well, I was not disappointed at all with 'Stories...' The game is solid, complete, fun, fast paced, with a great story (or stories) and fun fighting mechanics. It has very good replayability and the price is right (almost too right). I recommend it 100%.
