I can be skeptical when buying indie games. On one hand, i want to help small developers but, on the other, i want to make sure it is a solid, finished product i am getting. Well, i was not disappointed at all with 'stories...' the game is solid, complete, fun, fast paced, with a great story (or stories) and fun fighting mechanics. It has very good replayability and the price is right (almost too right). I recommend it 100%.
