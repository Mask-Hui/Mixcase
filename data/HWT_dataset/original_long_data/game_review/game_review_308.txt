Much harder than the first, but every bit as suspenseful and interesting. In terms of gameplay, it's more of the same from the first one, with a few gimmicks thrown in like the music box and the freddy mask. I'm one of those people who's mostly in this for the lore and i have to say, the first game was interesting, but this one, in terms of story alone, is far better. The story behind this game is interesting, dark, engaging, and has so much mystery to it that people still speculate about what's going on. Take it for what it is; if you're a fan of the first, this one's more of the same, with a bit of added challenge. ('a bit' meaning that it can be damn near impossible at times.)
