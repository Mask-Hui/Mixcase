It's been a long time since i had so much fun on a game. I went from frustration (the good kind!) to tears of laughter, it is extremely fun and entertaining, always surprising. It requires a good mix of skill and thinking, a bit of patience too, it's also pretty and never boring. If you always play games with buddies, i highly recommend this game. Heck, even if you don't! best proof this game is awesome, i took the time to write a review!
