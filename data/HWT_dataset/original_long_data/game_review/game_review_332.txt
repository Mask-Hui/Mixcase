It's been a long time since I had so much fun on a game.  I went from frustration (the good kind!) to tears of laughter, it is extremely fun and entertaining, always surprising.  It requires a good mix of skill and thinking, a bit of patience too, it's also pretty and never boring.  If you always play games with buddies, I highly recommend this game. Heck, even if you don't!  Best proof this game is awesome, I took the time to write a review!
