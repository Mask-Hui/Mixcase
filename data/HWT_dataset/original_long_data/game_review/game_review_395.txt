Played through and beat this with the hillbilly, scientist, and adventurer. I didn't find this game creative or interesting and generally felt it was a complete waste of time. The narrator was annoying as hell and the game play was so old and overused (each of your party members have different, unique skills, never heard of this before!). Before you say i didn't get the message or the parable of the story, i did, i get it, i understand the subliminial messaging, but it still doesn't change the fact it was a crap game, uninspired, underwhelming, and there's absolutely nothing you'll lose in life from skipping this. Bottom line: pass up this game. There are so many other good games to play!
