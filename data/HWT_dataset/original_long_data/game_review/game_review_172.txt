Loving it, so far! It obviously needs polish, but I really like the feel of having Brink back ;-) I haven't experienced any problems, and the 3 matches I've played have been great. The one thing that makes me a little nervous is a couple of the maps seem unbalanced (defenders had positions that couldn't be flanked, etc.). That might just be because I don't know the maps at all, but we'll see. I've heard about performance issues, so I just started on the lowest graphics, and it ran great. I'll try increasing to something more reasonable and see how it goes.
