Loving it, so far! it obviously needs polish, but i really like the feel of having brink back ;-) i haven't experienced any problems, and the 3 matches i've played have been great. The one thing that makes me a little nervous is a couple of the maps seem unbalanced (defenders had positions that couldn't be flanked, etc.). That might just be because i don't know the maps at all, but we'll see. I've heard about performance issues, so i just started on the lowest graphics, and it ran great. I'll try increasing to something more reasonable and see how it goes.
