Yet another Half-Life mod that goes above and beyond.  If you're a Counterstrike fan (or a fan of any military shooters, really), you owe it to yourself to check this title out.  Exceptionally realistic gameplay (you're only going to get shot once or twice before hitting the ground), great maps, realistic weaponry, and a solid playerbase make this game one of the older shooters that still stands strong today. Even during off-hours you can find a packed server list.  As with pretty much every other Valve / Source title, I highly recommend this one.
