Having clocked dark souls 1+dlc, just finished dark souls 2 and being in the middle of demon's souls i can say that i will be quite critical in this review, bearing in mind it's strengths and obvious weaknesses in comparison to the other games in the series. I also will not mention pvp pros or cons as the story was my main and only focus. Pros -the graphics. My goodness this is a pretty game, i actually stopped playing and just looked at the game early on, especially the water and wind effects. - combat animations look and feel great - music was great like all the other games in the series, filling you with dread and awe for bosses or particularly areas was always cool - simplification of some design choices from des and ds1, for example being able to buy healing items, items being repaired whenever you touch a bonfire (and a small fee to repair from the blacksmith if they do) and lots of save points/bonfires meaning that you generally won't go long without seeing another one. - great weapon and armor choices. Just like all of the other games in the series there is sooo many options for weapons. Cons - comparative lack of imagination with bosses, some were simple reskins of bosses from the first game and even in some cases fighting the same boss twice with a paint job... Really disappointed with this. - difficulty spike with the dlc and general late game. Yes the games are supposed to be challenging and hair tearingly difficult, but i was almost forced to despawn all enemies before any relevant boss simply because i wouldn't be able to survive otherwise. I picked this game up for sale on $20, if you bought des or ds1 and enjoyed it then i would only reccomend if on sale.
