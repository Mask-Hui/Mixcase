An absolute great stragtegy game! Having played every single other Wargame (European Escalation, and ALB), I have to say this one fits well. The number of units are GREAT. Not sure exactly how many units there are, but there's a crap ton!!!  Graphics are just beautiful, sounds are great, and the gameplay overall is epic.  The ingame chat box at the main menu is very entertaining as well, NO I am NOT kidding.  However, if anyone thinking this game is 'easy', or if you are new to the strategy genre, it could take you quite some time to get it nailed down. Do NOT get upset, you WILL lose a LOT of units. Just make sure you plan ahead, always have Anti-Air, and Anti-Tank. Do not do silly things with your jets either. You WILL lose them very easily. Most times I have played, the enemy team is stacked with Anti Air assets. (Specially if they are USSR/Redfor with the BUK system). However, some players end up ragequitting. It's understandable, but a lot of times it's just pure 'throw the white flag up!'.   The developers are going to be fixing and adding more factions to the Redfor to balance it out, as the Blufor is very decked. But, the weaponry is great on redfor.   I recommend this game to everyone.
