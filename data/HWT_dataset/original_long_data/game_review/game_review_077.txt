Totally fantastic. I wish more than anything I had something like this growing up. As an only child growing up with a single parent, there was never really anyone to play board games with. I also never really hung out with anyone who was into board games or table top games despite how much I loved them. Even now, I don't have a lot of local friends outside of my husband who are down to set up a game of DnD or Monopoly and play into the wee hours of the night. This has opened up so many opportunities to play the games I never got to when I was younger, as well as a chance to play the games I had to try to play alone. Thanks so much for this. Now I just have to convince all of my friends both near and far to put this simulator on their computers so we can all hang out and play games when we don't have to time or money to meet up in person!  10/10 PLEASE GET THIS SIMULATOR
