It's finally here for everyone! tree of savior is a spiritual successor to ragnarok online that carves out its own identity through its unique flavour of lore. However, the core attraction of ragnarok remains in the diverse class system that allows you to build your own character from the ground up. The game is free to play, but with an optional cash shop. Included in this cash shop are gameplay-affecting items, most prominently the subscription-like token system which offers a few benefits such as faster exp gain. I've played the closed betas for both the korean and international versions, and here are my thoughts on why you should try this mmo: pros: incredible class diversity thanks to the 'make your own class' system the audio and visuals combine beautifully to create an interesting and enjoyable world combat feels engaging, especially during boss fights the areas in the game are rather varied, helping to stave off boredom when questing cons: levelling is often grindy, which may put off a lot of players, especially since many of the more interesting classes can only be taken late-game the complexity of many of the game systems can be overwhelming for new players, especially when planning out your end-game character's build the main storyline is linear and uninteresting should you play tree of savior? i'd say it's definitely worth a try. Play with friends if you can, as it can help you get through the early game's grind quicker. Some players might not be able to stick it out, sadly, but with no more character wipes, you can take as long as you like to get through the content. The cash shop definitely does not ruin the experience for a free player, but is a worthy investment if you plan to stick with the game in the long term.
