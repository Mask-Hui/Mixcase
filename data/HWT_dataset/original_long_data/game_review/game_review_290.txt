Today's games treat you as a child; quest compasses, enemies scaled down to your level, health packs and re-spawn chambers galore. A stark contrast to most mainstream gaming, this game offers challenge, immersion and most importantly; Colour.   This game believes you are a thinking adult capable of a challenge. Unfortunately that means this game achieves that to the extreme: the game does NOT like you. It sees you as a thing to be crushed and it does so with such enthusiasm you sometimes wonder if you were meant to win at all. When it comes down to it though, winning is sometimes is not as important if the game-play is solid enough, this game has excelled in that matter.  Fantastic artwork and character concepts accompanied with a subtle yet powerful soundtrack, this game while trying its best to make you give up in frustration, will keep drawing you back just for the amazing unique experience itself.   A challenging but alluring game, this is a treasure that must be played.
