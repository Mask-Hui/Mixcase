This one is a little bit on the easy side, but it's a very solid and smart platform action game with an off-kilter theme.  Think of this as if it were a modern day Bio-Force Ape with Grim Fandango aesthtics.. fun melee combat enhanced with Pile Drivers and Suplexes, sprawling and genuinely fun to navigate levels, and It even has a poster of Manny Calavera hanging on a wall somewhere.
