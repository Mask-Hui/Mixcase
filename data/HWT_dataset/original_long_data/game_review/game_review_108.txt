This one is a little bit on the easy side, but it's a very solid and smart platform action game with an off-kilter theme. Think of this as if it were a modern day bio-force ape with grim fandango aesthtics.. Fun melee combat enhanced with pile drivers and suplexes, sprawling and genuinely fun to navigate levels, and it even has a poster of manny calavera hanging on a wall somewhere.
