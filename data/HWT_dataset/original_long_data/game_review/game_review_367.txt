Sadly, War Thunder went from being my favourite game, to feeling like i am watching a large building fire, just waiting for a structural collapse before i finally laugh &amp; walk away.   Got to Jets in all nations (before they trebled the grind &amp; before linking account to steam) and the constant reshuffling of planes, changing of battle ratings and nerfing of anything without a russian flag on it is beyond a joke. In 2 years, they have probably spent 15 minutes working on the japanese tree. I wish i was joking.  Today there was a 'Q&amp;A' with the developers on the WT forum, but they moderated the questions so people only asked what they wanted them to ask, then STILL had the nerve to act like everything is going well &amp; the problem's are fixable.  The community has been asking for a boatload of changes for 2+ years and we havent seen a single one. Instead we just get 'client stability improved' and 5 more Yaks added to the russian tree. They ignore all attempts to help them, shut down player councils THEY SET UP without reason &amp; generally act like the stalinist pigs that they are. Any bad language will get you chat banned in game, or worse, your account deleted. They are operating the company as if it were communist russia itself &amp; we all know how well that ended!!  Anyway, I'm finally done with this game. It was fun for a while, but the constant meddling behind the scenes (BR compression, addition of wagers/orders/boosters/game modes nobody asked for) &amp; the buffing of russian planes to disguise the fact their pilots/players are utterly terrible is the last straw.   After ignoring EVERYTHING the community has said since i started playing, it seems they are finally ready to implode in a spectacular fireball. This is no longer a game. It is a retirement fund for 2 ignorant old men who have no interest in aviation or even warfare in general.
