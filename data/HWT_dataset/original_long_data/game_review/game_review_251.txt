So much fun for only 99 cent on sale!! i'm into this game for only 30 minutes now, and it's pretty cool! first i thought this only is one of those many cheap shooters, but this one really got atmosphere and style, the spaceship feels real, the graphics are great, and all this with a cool soundtrack... Yeah it's repetitiv but doesn't bother, you have to find your way through this large spaceshipt and fight those zombies, the game does manage to put the player under 'positive' pressure, rushing to find the way. Pros: -decent graphics and textures -good and smooth game-engine -good soundtrack -dense atmosphere -many different weapons cons: -aiming the gun feels a bit like you're drunk
