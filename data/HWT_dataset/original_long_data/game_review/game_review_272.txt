I purchased Pixel Piracy on a Humble Bundle. Totally worth the $1.00, but I don't think its worth $10.00. I think the max price I would pay for this would be about $5.00, averaging out to a solid $3.00 game.   Pixel Piracy is a (captain obvious) pirate game in which you micromanage your captain and crew in order to kill others and gain gold, loot, weapons, and experience. The patches are flying in and the game is rapidly changing so while it's not an 'early-access' title It still feels that it's in the BETA stage. There are still some pretty obvious bugs going on (especially with rapid patching) but all-in-all they have done a wonderful job with the game. Keep up the good work devs!
