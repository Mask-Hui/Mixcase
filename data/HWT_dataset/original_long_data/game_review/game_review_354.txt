A lovingly created game, that is well written with logical puzzles that aren't designed to leave you stumped. One of the better gaming interfaces of any adventure game i have played. For people that love in insane leaps of logic found in games such as the whispered world, or find the item games such as monkey island, this adventure may be to tame for you. For all other point and clickers, i can sincerely recommend this game. Would give a solid 8/10
