Due to unforseen circumstances steam had refunded this game when it was suspected that my account was used for fraud so all of my last few purchases were refunded. A few games i had bought i was fairly angry about because i got them for dirt cheap and was sad to see them get taken away...however there is light in all this because one of my purchases was this....thing. Pathfinding is garbage, the story is a joke, the graphics look like a hybrid of brink and command and conquer generals but the one thing i had severe issues with was the fact that half of the time you would have a well-made plan to execute in one of the missions and everything seems fine but the one unit you had assigned to hack the command center is on the other side of the island getting shot up and it doesn't want to work right so you control it yourself and the driving is more closely related to guiding a bolder in a shopping cart. Save your money, do not buy this game. I was lucky enough to get it returned, i will remember to not make that mistake again. It might be worth $5 on a random steam sale but it certainly isn't worth more than that.
