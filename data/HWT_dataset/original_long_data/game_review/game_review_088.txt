To the moon is a truly emotional game, equally sweet and sad in nature, and the same extends to its masterful soundtrack. I would recommend this game to anybody for its great gaming experiance that engulfs you into the game. This is one of the first games ever to almost make me cry... But overall to the moon is breathtaking... Truly breathtaking...
