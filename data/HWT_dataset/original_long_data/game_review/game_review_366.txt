Everything you love about the boardgame, but with cool computer graphics and automatic calculations. It adds some new stuff, but the standard rules are the way to go. The ai is a little stupid, but you can always find a good match vs a human with the online multiplayer. You can also play hotseat, which i think is an amazing feature. In the grim dark future, there is only football. Enjoy!
