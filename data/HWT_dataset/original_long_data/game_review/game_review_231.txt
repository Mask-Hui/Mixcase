This game is extremely funny, cute, clever, sweet, and generally great. And the ending was incredible. I recommend it if you liked earthbound, have never played earthbound but thought you'd probably like it, or have never heard of earthbound. I'm saying it's a bit like earthbound at times. It probably requires, like, some minor amount of dexterity? not much anyway. It's great and you should definitely play it okay bye
