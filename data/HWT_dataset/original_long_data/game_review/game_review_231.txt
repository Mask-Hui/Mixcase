This game is extremely funny, cute, clever, sweet, and generally great. And the ending was incredible. I recommend it if you liked Earthbound, have never played Earthbound but thought you'd probably like it, or have never heard of Earthbound. I'm saying it's a bit like Earthbound at times. It probably requires, like, some minor amount of dexterity? Not much anyway. It's great and you should definitely play it okay bye
