If you're looking for a game accurately depicting world war 1, please look no further than verdun, this game *even though battlefield 1 is also a world war 1 game but it's historical accuracy is eh* is the prime example of what world war 1 was even though you play as mostly ground troops/the cannon fodder in the war, the game still holds up the majority of what world war 1 was, gas attacks, trench rushing/trench battles and how you always had to be vigilant. The team working on this game is doing what i believe to be awesome work, keep it up guys! this game is good so far, it has alot of potential and fire in it!
