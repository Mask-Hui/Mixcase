If you're looking for a game accurately depicting World War 1, please look no further than Verdun, this game *even though Battlefield 1 is also a World War 1 game but it's historical accuracy is Eh* is the prime example of what World War 1 was even though you play as mostly ground troops/the cannon fodder in the war, the game still holds up the majority of what world war 1 was, Gas attacks, Trench rushing/Trench battles and how you always had to be vigilant.   The team working on this game is doing what I believe to be awesome work, keep it up guys! This game is good so far, it has alot of potential and fire in it!
