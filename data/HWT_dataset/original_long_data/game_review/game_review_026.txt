Fallout new vegas is the second best post-apocalyptic game money can buy. It has good graphics, fun gameplay, a branching plot, and tons of more content you can play. I do recommend the game, but if you ask me you should just get fallout 3 which, in my opinion, is the best post-apocalyptic game ever. There is one problem with fallout 3 and that is it not being optimized for windows 7 and above. Fallout new vegas is however optimized for windows 7 and above.
