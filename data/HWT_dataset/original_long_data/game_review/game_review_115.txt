First off, I can't bring myself to forgive the devs for making stealth obsolete. **** the trapper's new ability. But I will say, it seems like the devs give a damn. Constant updates and new content shows me that they're trying. I've loved evolve since it was in alpha, and if this is the direction the developers decide to take, then so be it.      But for ♥♥♥♥s sake, can we get some maps that are bigger than my bathtub?
