First, I must say, I bought this game from Steam, and to much of my disappointment, it didn't work. It looked really fun and I was determined to get it working and playable. So I requested a refund from Steam and I went to the developer's website and bought the game again. Not only was it 35% off, but it worked. I have really enjoyed it. It is a great game to spend some time on, and if you enjoy tycoon and simulation games, I'm sure you will love it.
