First, i must say, i bought this game from steam, and to much of my disappointment, it didn't work. It looked really fun and i was determined to get it working and playable. So i requested a refund from steam and i went to the developer's website and bought the game again. Not only was it 35% off, but it worked. I have really enjoyed it. It is a great game to spend some time on, and if you enjoy tycoon and simulation games, i'm sure you will love it.
