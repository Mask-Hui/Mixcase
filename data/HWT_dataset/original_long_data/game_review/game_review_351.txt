One of the better video game sequals to have ever been released, Portal 2 dives back into Aperture Labratories after the events of the first game, but this time we have more characters, more puzzle elements, and one of the deepest darkest stories of all time. Al long as you have the PC port, there is also a mode for creating your own test chambers, and a co-op mode for playing with friends in new levels.
