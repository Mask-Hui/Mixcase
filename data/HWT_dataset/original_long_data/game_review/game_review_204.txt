This really isn't worth buying. It's literally a dosbox port of the game, the music audio is so loud that it will over power everything else in the game and deafen you even if you turn the game down to almost nothing. The controls need to be reconfigured before you can play and then sometimes the keys just get stuck and you'll be walking forward continuously. It saddens me as this is a great game but because of it's outdated control's and windowing issues and ear bleedingly loud audio makes it impossible to enjoy. Truely a waste. This version of the game provides all the episodes but it's not reworked like duke nukem megaton edition or shadow warrior redux, it's the barebones 1990's version before wasd was a thing and mouse aiming wasn't a thought in anyones mind. It's just barely playable and it's more so like being tortured than having fun. It would be nice if who ever published this asked the team that did shadow warrior redux to rework this game to run with out dosbox and fixed some of the frustrating and cumbersome issues that come along with it. I get it, it's 'old school' but duke and shadow warrior are old school as well and got modern control and minor graphical upgrades to make those games look pleasent and run and control as they should. Sad to say this is one to avoid until someone does a decent update to this game so it can run properly and isn't just a dosbox port. Skip this one and go watch a lets play of it, save your self the headache and the waste of a few dollars.
