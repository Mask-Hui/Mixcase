Game's a lot of fun when you don't have to pay $120 for it. It's f2p and i'm not sure how to throw my money at it yet, so i suppose that's a good thing. The grind's not too long, characters range from 2750 to 9500 in cost, the most expensive being the monsters, and there is a weekly rotation of 4 free hunters and 1 free monster. Comparatively, i've made ~15000 in 5-6 hours of gameplay.
