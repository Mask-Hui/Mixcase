I highly recommend this game when is fixed sadly i cannot recommend this game tho i love xcom and i need to say xcom 2 looks and plays really well but... The game crashed multiple times before i was able to pass intro... I was able to play for no more than 10 minutes into the mission before it freezes and i have to alt-ctrl-del each time... Not to mention that steam restarts the game automaticaly after that but game never starts it just loading endlessly... I bought my xcom2 before its release date hoping to enjoy it as much as i enjoyed the first one but im really disappointed because its almost a month since its release and i still cant play it without freezes all the time. I feel cheated by the developers...this game shouldnt be released in this state as its not early access or beta its a finished game that sadly doesnt work. Btw there was a patch but it didnt change anything regarding mentioned problems.
