First Sakura game I have bought and played. Main reason was that it had voice acting. The girls' emotions were believable and endearing. I was attracted to the story setting i.e. fantasy worlds, which are one of my favourite settings though this game being what it is, there is no Elder Scrolls depth of lore. CG art style is amazing as always and is why I have been a big fan of the Sakura Series.   I added in the 18+ patch as suggested by other reviewers. It is safe so go ahead and use it if you want to. The H-scenes are worth returning to after a first playthrough. Voice actresses were somewhat believable during the scenes.   However, this game can mislead some to think that sleeping with attractive girls is easy. The girls personalities' were pleasing and their enthuasism in bed is quite motivating but remember that most of us are not the sons of a famous hero that will grant us with status and skill that will easily make panties wet. The game progressed to the H-scenes rather too quickly though I suppose the makers of this game already know the real reason most of us would be buying this game and want us to get to the goods quickly.  Nevertheless, remember to clean up your crime scene afterwards.  Regards.
