I highly recommend this game WHEN is fixed  Sadly I cannot recommend this game tho i love Xcom and i need to say Xcom 2 looks and plays really well but...  The game crashed multiple times before i was able to pass intro...  I was able to play for no more than 10 minutes into the mission before it freezes and i have to alt-ctrl-del each time...  Not to mention that steam restarts the game automaticaly after that but game never starts it just loading endlessly...  I bought my Xcom2 before its release date hoping to enjoy it as much as i enjoyed the first one but im really disappointed because its almost a month since its release and i still cant play it without freezes all the time.  I feel cheated by the developers...this game shouldnt be released in this state as its not early access or beta its a finished game that sadly doesnt work.  Btw there was a patch but it didnt change anything regarding mentioned problems.
