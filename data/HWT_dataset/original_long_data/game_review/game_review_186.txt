it's not bad, it's just really mediocre  by the time i beat the game, i really didn't want to play it any more. this is probably due to an overall dull atmosphere and lack of an interesting story and/or cast of characters. the gameplay is also very repetitive, making little to no changes as you progress. however, that's not to say it's bad, as it consists of a very finished combat system. overall, it just isn't very fun. it lacks replayability, the level design is pretty boring, and it has a severe lack of variety in content.
