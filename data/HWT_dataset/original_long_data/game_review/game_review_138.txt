An ode to Super Hexagon   I wanna be Hexagonest Like no one ever was To start them is my test To beat them is my cause  Wounds will unravel across my hand, Blistering far and wide. Each Hexagon to understand The shape that's inside  Hexagon its you and me I know its my destiny Hexagon, oh, you're my worst friend On a desk I must upend  Hexagon, I start to rue That I chose to buy you You time me and I'll time you Hex-a-gon, gotta click 'em all  Every shape along the way With courage I will face I will battle every day To claim my rightful place  Rage with me, the time is right There's so much time to redeem. Arm in arm we'll do this right It's always been our dream  Hexagon!  Gotta click 'em all  It's you and me I know it's my destiny  Hexagon!  Oh, you're my worst friend, On a desk I must upend.  Hexagon!  A start so true. Our anger will pull us through. You time me and I'll time you.  Heeeexaaaagoooooonnnnnn!  Gotta click 'em all  Gotta click 'em all  Gotta click 'em all  Gotta click 'em all  Gotta click 'em all  Yeah!  Hexagon!
