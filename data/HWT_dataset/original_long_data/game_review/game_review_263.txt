After hearing about this game i had to see for myself what all the hype/disappointment was about so i bought my copy. For 99 cents how could you go wrong? i attempted to boot up the game and was met at a weird screen that looked like the game was far away. I attempted to restart the game and it still had the game far away. After tons of troubleshooting i looked to my right and saw that my vive's display was on. The game has vive support. After unplugging my vive the game booted up normally. Anyway, moving onto the pros/cons of 'summer sale'. Pros it's 99 cents. Humorous takes on the steam summer sale and popular titles. Jabs at windows updates, jokes about downloading ram/deleting sys32, etc. Somewhat interesting minigames when 'buy' titles. Cons old jokes that are stale. Some of the minigames are broken. Such as the teleporting game. The game itself is glitchy. It deleted my save progress and i had to start over again. No replay value. Once you get a nice laugh from some of the reference and get all the achievements you'll never boot it again. So in conclusion i'm going to have to say that i don't recommend this game to people that are looking for a serious title that they'd like to spend more than 30 minutes in tops. This is a parody game and as such doesn't have a high replay value. I'm not however going to ask for a refund as i think i've gotten 99 cents worth of laughter for the game and the trading cards are just going to 'lessen' the blow of the game's price. All in all if you like 'meme' humor, playing a semi decent simulator, and have 99 cents to blow then go for it.
