I'm only recommending it because its a dollar in the humble bundle. I didn't grow up playing the old shooters, I heard about this game when it came out through some YouTubers I watched and since I was 12 I enjoyed the comedy of it. I'm 17 now, and the comedy provides no actual comedy, its just ♥♥♥ jokes and the word ♥♥♥♥. I'm not intriqued by the story at all, the gun play is terrible, the mouse will show up on screen along with the cross hair and distract you constantly, the mouse sensitivty is horribly low for a game where you have not much health. Overall, is it worth your dollar, not really in my opinion, but I like more sensible comedy rather than hey lets talk about ♥♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥. The graphics aren't impressive, at all. In the strip club level you can see that the boobs aren't anything near a round object and more representitive of physics defying pentagons. If you enjoy that comedy then I can recomend this to you
