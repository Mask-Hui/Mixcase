To get to the point, the latest update added pay2win microtransactions and nerfed most, if not all non-microtransaction guns. If you want a loadout in the game that is of any use then you will have to gamble your money away. Shame really, I actually enjoyed this game, even with all that power creep DLC content.  To make it clear, unless the game has been unpatched from this cancer, I DO NOT recommend it. Actually I don't recommend it even if they unpatch it, you know that they are going to try it some other time if they can't do it now.
