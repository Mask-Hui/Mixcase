While not perfect, this game has been greatly enjoyable.  The save system and possibility of sudden death leads to some frustration. I'm on my first playthrough and I lost my main character around hour 10 of 20ish. Would have really liked a save to reload at that point. I've since picked up a 3rd party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures.  Plus the aiming reticule is on the small side and zoom is underpowered.  With all that said, its been a blast. I'm not normally a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, first person shooter/beat em up is great. I've been playing it as often as I can get away... just one more mission, just one more supply run - or I'm running away and want to get safe before shutting the game down.   In general its not overly difficult, but occasionally it will throw a curveball at you and its suddenly down to boots (always good to have a 2nd melee) and hoping to get lucky since running may not be an option.   Graphics/controls are ok. Animations/gameplay is great (beyond a few control quirks).  Itemization is good, base building is somewhat simplified but still a good aspect.  Randomization is good, variety is great as well.  Best part is that out of probably 20+ characters I've had in my group, you start getting attached to a few of them and trying to build them up. Then it gets even more tense in one of those boot heel fights.
