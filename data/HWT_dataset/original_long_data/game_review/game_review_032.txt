I have to give this game some credit. It has features that I have never seen in any other F2P Steam game up until now: - Opens up a new window, in internet explorer, just to try to sell you something. - A $500 price option for premium currency. - Takes 1 second to install. - Takes 1 second to uninstall.  It may be too early in the year to call it, but take my word for it now and quote me on it later, 'Best uninstall simulator of 2015.'
