What i liked about terraria is that with all the new updates coming out the game has been really awsome you could get really strong weopns and armor you could even get mounts now and ride in the minecarts to me that is really awsome and that there are new npc's too and that there are new monsters to slay and there are even more doungens to go into yes finaly and its cool how the npcs talk to each other and play rock,paper,scisser's
