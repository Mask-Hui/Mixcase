back in the days a few years ago, it was really fun to go out and survive, traveling to different safezones and liberate them of the nether enemies that roam there when the devices are needing repairs. As well as that it helped to get the special edition back in the day. Us players who have gotten the game in special 'Chosen Edition' (There are other editions), We got a 2nd currency that would give us perks such as the Soldier skin or other skins. Instead when they rolled it back, They completely got rid of that. usually when game devs gets the game out of beta the people who paid the extra cash for the special editions, they get extra bonuses if they stuck around. Nope not us, we wasted 30+ dollars getting an edition we essentially didnt keep. And the game isnt that good anymore. Despite that what was the point getting the game back when it was $10 base price without special edition?
