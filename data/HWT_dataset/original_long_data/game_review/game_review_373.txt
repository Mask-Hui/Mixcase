Dreadfully boring. Nothing like Skyrim or any previous game. The archery is totally ruined in this game. Arrows sort of lock on to enemies and follow them until they strike. There's no skill to archery anymore.  The quests are generic. The landscape doesn't look very interesting. Major downgrade from Skyrim.
