*note, i have not played any other bioshock games bioshock infinite has a good story, great graphics. This game seriously lacks in gunplay and mechanics. This game doesn't have any replayability and is fairly short. You can finish this game in 9 hours, maybe a bit more if you do sidequests. Also this game is pretty easy on normal difficulty (thats the hardest difficulty in the game by the way) however don't get me wrong, i enjoyed this game. I just don't think its a really good game. So if you want story and graphics, youre fine. If you like shooting things like a person without a mind go buy this game. If you really like in depth-mechanics and gunplay go buy another game. Also i don't give score because you can't give criticism in a number.
