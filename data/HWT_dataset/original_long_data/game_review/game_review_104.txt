A first impressions review: fistful of frags is a fun, unique, and addicting multiplayer fps. This may be one of the only multiplayer games where killing an enemy feels extremely rewarding, because the weapons are slow but powerful. Sadly, there is one fault of the game. The default carbine smith. It is way too overpowered! believe me, i've used it to get some amazing killstreaks, but i know it's too good. It can be an instakill with a headshot, which are easy to land with it with enough practice. Still, the game is fun and i will play it a lot more over the next few weeks.
