A game isn't a fandom. Unfortunately, like with many other great games/movies, the hordes of wapanese weaboos eager to make out-of-contest gay drawings of everyone and EVERYTHING f****ng each other's ***hole have swarmed to 'contaminate' this game too. unfortunately indeed.  But, if you just want to play a game for what it is (and not because your fanboy friend on some god-forgotten anime forum told you to with unnecessary enphasis), this is a very good product. Even with such a simple and humble art and combat design, this game manages to punch a storyline full of details and great moments. It has its joking moments, it has his fun situations, and when it comes down to it it has a beautiful and heartwarming, even if maybe a little naive, plot. To discover it all you'll have to play this game in many different ways, but it will be worth it. Combat system is... strange at best, a little too simple, but it is atleast original and different for every charachter you encounter. The music.. well, darn good job there.  So, apart from the USUAL no-lifers out there, don't get fooled by the over-hype and mainstream culture: this is a good game. It gave me good moments, feels and fun. I think that at â‚¬9.99 is a good deal.
