I honestly dont understand the devs of this game at all. In an normal fps friendly fire is ok like planetside 2 for example but!!! when you add melee into it your looking at a total faceparm time when you see 1 person jump into a group and watch as the group kills them selves by melee cleaving.  The 3rd person camura and cross hair bouncing is annoying as hell plus with the limited view its hard to see the 2 shotting melee classes coming if you play ranged.  constant 200ms if your from europe as the player base is so small they got rid of the europe server and now there is only NA even if they havent offically stated so.  General bad class/weapon/faction balance.  In short this game is in crash grap mode they will say alot of stuff but the game is dead on arrival and i doubt it be around in ayears time whats a shame as i love the idea of a 40k fps but this isnt what i was hoping for.
