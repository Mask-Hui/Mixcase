If your looking for a great bus simulator with great realism, then you have come to the right place. OMSI can be quite expensive for what you get which is true, but excluding the paid DLC and main maps you get with the game; there is a huge library of fan made dlc content for this game that is completely free.  Yes you will have to read to make sure you install it correctly, but after the messing around with installing all the dlc into the programs main folder itâ€™s a great experience.  So I would defiantly recommend this game for gamers that like there simulators. But just a heads up it plays a lot better with a steering wheel.
