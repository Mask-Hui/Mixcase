Good game, great graphics. When there is a battle, bringing the screen, the feeling that you yourself are fighting there. During battles you feel you are a ghost that nobody can see. Who went back in time and watching a real battle of the middle ages. Realistic sounds, voices, and the battle itself made this game exciting and very interesting, impossible to put down.
