Carmageddon, mario kart/blur, twisted metal, flatout all rolled into one! looks like this will get a lot of playing time this christmas. Even a holiday patch to boot. There's not a whole lot more i could ask for. Ok. Maybe more players in multiplayer. Seems to be the same for all arcade drivers i play. Community dies down fast. Don't give up on this game! if you like arcade style racing smooshed in with destruction and mayhem, this might be the game for you!
