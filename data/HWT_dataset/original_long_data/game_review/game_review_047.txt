Carmageddon, Mario Kart/Blur, Twisted Metal, Flatout all rolled into one! Looks like this will get a lot of playing time this Christmas. Even a holiday patch to boot. There's not a whole lot more I could ask for. OK. Maybe more players in multiplayer. Seems to be the same for all arcade drivers I play. Community dies down fast. Don't give up on this game! If you like arcade style racing smooshed in with destruction and mayhem, this might be the game for you!
