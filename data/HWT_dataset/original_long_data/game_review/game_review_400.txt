Portal is the game that taught us that first-person perspective isn't only for blasting zombies. Portal is the reason it has become basically impossible to have a conversation involving cake. Portal is the inspiration for hundred of mods, spinoffs, imitations, and evolutions. If you haven't played portal, you're not only missing out on an excellent game, but also a sizable chunk of modern culture. It's the video-game equivalent of not having watched a new hope, the princess bride, or rocky horror picture show. Portal is a first-person, physics-based puzzler in which the player is guided through a series of test chambers by a snarky, disembodied voice. The main gameplay mechanic involves the portal gun, which allows the player to create a wormhole between any two points, provided that she has line of sight to them, and that they're covered with specially treated portal surface. Test chambers require the player to manipulate various combinations of buttons and switches to advance, and creative use of portals is generally necessary in order to do so. While this description alone may not be selling you, the things that really make portal shine are the attention to detail, the fantastic level design and the superb writing, which combine to transform what could have been a spectacularly dull game into a cult sensation and the seed of an entire genre. Go play portal! for science! and cake! i nominated this for the 'villain most in need of a hug' steam award 2016.
