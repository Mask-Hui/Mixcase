One of the most badass games i ever played. The katana swordplay is a great to look at, the missions (especially bonus) are fun, the music and sounds are awesome. What happens on the screen is also pretty weird - in a positive sense. If you like fast-paced action, then this game is for you. Also if you are a fan of japanese manga and anime it's an added value, because the game is as close to an good action anime as it can.
