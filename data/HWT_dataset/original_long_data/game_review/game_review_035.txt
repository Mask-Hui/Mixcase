So I downloaded the game and played it for a little while, and it was nothing special. I spent more time trying to log in though than actually playing the game. There is a bug where it says that there was an update to the Terms of Service or whatever and whenever you clicked 'Accept' it would just pop up again. You have to restart the client for it to work. Now that isn't that bad but why do I need to link my Steam and GFACE accounts? They say it is for DLC but why is that even necessary? It is also not reversable so now I know that a company I don't care about has access to my Steam information.  Now the game itself is so so. It is easily recognisable as a COD clone, except somehow they made the gunplay worse... How is that even possible? Also the menu looks like s***. I really like games with nice clear menues but his is just a jumbled mess of buttons that don't explain themself.
