This game is unlike alot of games out today. Instead of showing the military side of war, it took a face of the struggles refugees deal with. There was alot of character development, because any harsh decisions you make involving other survivors, grow and affect your survivors accordingly. The game has a strange effect on the human side of the player. As you can choose to either help people in need or stick to your own devices. 10/10 would play again
