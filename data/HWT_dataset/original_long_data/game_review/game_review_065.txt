It's strange, this game. It's disarmingly simple, and to it's core is nothing but a series of fetch quests in perpetuity over randomized maps. Yet... the way it's put together makes it very addicting. In the lulls between combat, the game takes on a completely different feel - calming and soothing as you deliver goods to various cities. You can make it as stressful as you want - should you go where the winds take you, or try to powerlevel a city to max, so you can buy that one last boat? Up to you! Then when the cannonballs hit the hull, there's just enough variety of both loot and skills that there's more than one way to sink a ship. Disarmingly simple. The smallest sandbox game you can buy. No false advertising here.  8/10 - That moment when you realize it's a grind.  - Multiplayer seems half fleshed out.
