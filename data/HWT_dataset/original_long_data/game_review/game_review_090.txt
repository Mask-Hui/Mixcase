After pretty well mastering the game I find that it's combat system is what I dislike most about it. Pretty cool game overall but as combat is vital for the enjoyment of this game I just cant rate it that high. A simple fix would make this game great for single player fun, and that would be if they let you micro manage your units in combat more. The commands system they use might be the only way to make it work for multiplayer (something I could never find a group to do) but it is not very enjoyable for single player which is what you will be doing for 99.9% of this game. Let me know if they ever add the micromanagement option to the combat system and I will gladly revisit. As it stands, I can't imagine wanting to play it again. This game was SO CLOSE to being really great.
