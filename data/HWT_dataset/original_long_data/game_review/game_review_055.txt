This game scared me, not through darkness or monsters or horrifying fantasies, but by examining issues, situations, problems that exist for real people in real life. Wonderful books and films exist that do the same, but the strength of this interactive narrative is precisely that it is interactiveâ€”no story unfolds unless we, the players, are ready to piece it together. The narrative and its impact are thus inherently paced to match our curiosity and investment.   I will be thinking about this game for a long time, but to tell you why would ruin the point. So play, and see for yourself.
