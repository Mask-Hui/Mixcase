Dungeon Keeper, in the james bond era, with you being the bad guy..  Need i say more?  The game handles well The game is timeless (holds up just aswell today, as it did at launch) There is alot of humour There are many traps with really good annimations to them, and you can string them up really well!  Tbh, i cant really think of anything negative to say other than its a shame they did not make a sequel... :(
