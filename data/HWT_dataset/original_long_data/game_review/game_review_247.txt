'endless replayability' gets thrown around a lot, but the binding of isaac really does deliver on that lofty promise. With beautiful, hand-drawn graphics and a ridiculous variety in both power-ups and enemies, no two runs are even remotely similar. There's a lot to challenge even seasoned gamers, with the final bosses being incredibly tough... Though anything less from satan would be disappointing. The game draws heavily from biblical iconography, and while this is jarring (and possibly even slightly disturbing) to begin the style is brilliantly memorable when viewed as a whole. Highly recommended.
