Easily one of the best parkour like game i played so far. Amazing graphics and gameplay, only abit dissapointed with the short but well thought story line. I would love to pay extra for more dlc content or even add a free free-run mode. I really do hope the developers continue to provide more content for the game and i would highly recommend you try the game out for your self.
