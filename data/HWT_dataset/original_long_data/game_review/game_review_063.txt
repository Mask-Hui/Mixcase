Really great sandbox game that stands true to wurm online's core values. Pros: very few strict limitatations on what you can do - create an island by hand or become a potato farmer: the choice is yours. Pretty smooth with few issues even on servers with high ping. Customizable servers. Singleplayer / easy private server hosting. Cons: steep learning curve. Overwhelming options at first - use wurmpedia.com all in all it's a great game and i really do recommend trying it; just don't give up if you struggle initially. Hop into a server and ask for help, other players will gladly give you some pointers in the right direction,
