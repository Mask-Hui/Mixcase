Really great sandbox game that stands true to Wurm Online's core values.   Pros: Very few strict limitatations on what you can do - create an island by hand or become a potato farmer: the choice is yours. Pretty smooth with few issues even on servers with high ping. Customizable servers. Singleplayer / Easy private server hosting.  Cons: Steep learning curve. Overwhelming options at first - Use  wurmpedia.com   All in all it's a great game and I really do recommend trying it; just don't give up if you struggle initially. Hop into a server and ask for help, other players will gladly give you some pointers in the right direction,
