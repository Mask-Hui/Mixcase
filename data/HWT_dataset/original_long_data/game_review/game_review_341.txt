I could arguably recommend this, but there are cons that limit the new player's funtime experience. As a veteran player of Age of Chivalry, I found this game a nice graphic retouching of the original, but I find it frustrating in places like getting kicked for your ping jumping up for a second, or the toxicity of this game's community.  Many of them have criticised the swing mechanic and how players abuse it to make them look like spinning helicopter ballerinas. Truth is that it's actually very easy to counter these reverse-overheads and speed-ups. It's only because after a while you can see where you'd put your block when they do these moves. In other words they become very predictable.  NOW however this does not make it fun for the new player at all once they are kicked out of the low rank servers where they must deal with it. New players would have to put real dedication into it and master blocking these helicopter swings. Making the value of this game decrease dramatically due to it's fun value being lowered by this.  So in conclusion... Get it or not? Get Age of Chivalry first, it's free and has similar gameplay, you're also able to determine if Chivalry is right for you, but the community of Chivalry might drive you away though if you question this swinging mechanic so either turn off chat completely or stick to AoC. THERE ARE RARE CASES OF THE BALLERINAS NOT BEING IN A GAME, so you might be lucky to find such a game, especially if you're a new guy.  I will be playing this though, just because I'm used to the swing mechanic's exploitation being used on me, so it's not a big deal, but like I said it might not make it fun for the new player. (I to this day remain a pure fighter, never abused the swing mechanic.)
