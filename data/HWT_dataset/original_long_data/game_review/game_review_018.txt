Very atmospheric, beautiful looking game. Really goes back to the roots of the franchise, a must buy for any fans. The drone is most certainly terrifying as it stomps about the station, stalking you through vents and corridors. The crafting is great, lots of interesting and useful items to make. The story fits together well, and ties in with the original film quite well compared to other alien games.
