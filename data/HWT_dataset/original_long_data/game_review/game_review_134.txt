Being the 3rd installment in the trilogy i'll get the bad stuff out of the way first. I quite hate pre-quals as it's technically going backwards in a story and not forwards (this is an issue for every pre-qual). Granted it offers more storywise. The combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as arkham city managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013) there is a game breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story not effected). Some gadgets are put at a rediculous hotkey that makes your hand have to travel the whole keyboard to get to it. It might sound like nothing, but while in combat it could potentially break your combo. Now on to the great bits, it's freaking batman! the graphics look insanely amazing if your pc can run it on max settings. Being the 1st of the trilogy to not have kevin conroy &amp; mark hamill voicing their respective roles (conroy as batman and hamill as joker) the voice acting in the game i applaud for doing a well job, although i personally believe that conroy and hamill are 1 of a kind pair and can never be replaced. Roger craig smith (batman) &amp; troy baker (joker) still did an outstanding job. Although the combat is abit sloppy it does bring in fresh ideas to the table, such as enemies able to counter your attacks therefore you require to counter-counter their attacks, new gadgets that give you that extra edge in combat, and lastly much more upgrades available. I give this an 8.5/10. Had the combat not feel sloppy it would be an easy 9 or possibly 10.
