While not perfect, undertale is a super fun and engaging game that righfully deserves to have been one of the best games of 2015. The writing is superberb, the music is definietly worth buying the soundtrack for, the characters are all memorable, the story in general is fantastic. My only real criticism with the game is that the walking and text speed can be a bit too slow a times and for some people the humor (like any comedy-centric game) is subjective. Some people may not enjoy to humor the game has. I, for one did enjoy, the humor for me was great and i still crack up even after playing the game 3 times.
