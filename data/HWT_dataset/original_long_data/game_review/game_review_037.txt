Rayman legends is my favorite platformer. The platforming feels a lot more natural than most 2d games i've played (thinking of smb and mario), every world has a charming, unique style to it, and the musical levels at the end of each world are an absolute joy. A few parts felt obnoxiously difficult, but the game restarts very quickly after each death, so i never got frustrated. My one complaint is that the '8-bit' levels started to make me feel sick, but they only unlock after finishing the game and are easily ignored.
