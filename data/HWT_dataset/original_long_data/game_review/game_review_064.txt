Very late last night i finished this. The story is not very deep or interesting but what makes it stand out is the story-telling. The atmosphere is filled to the brim and the many collectibles do a great job at fleshing it out. I did learn a lot about the world of batman so it was a little disappointing that so few bosses were in the game. Oh well, there's enough future games to rectify that. The combat is the right amount of challenge but it's more on the easy side. Leveling up batman wasn't very satisfying. It's the gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign which add for nice new gameplay mechanics. Getting access to previously unreachable places makes for a nice sense of progression. While neither being a classic open-world nor traditionally linear, the mixture of both elements worked very well in the end. There is minimal backtracking unless you have an itch to complete all riddler challenges - which i did - but thanks to compact levels it didn't get tedious. I'm interested to see how this changes with future batman games that went open-world. On a technical level the game holds up surprisingly well, especially with unusually good texture work. Of course there are low-poly characters, assets and unconvincing lighting at spots but given it's a game from 2010, it still looks very nice. The pre-rendered cutscenes on the other hand are of unquestionably putrid quality with at times more artifacts than video. How did this even got through. Very recommended.
