This is an revolutionary program for anyone interested in Music creation. I don't need a drumkit or a midi keyboard to create professional sounding loops for many different genres! Once you try this approach you won't be able to do it any other way without feeling like your wasting time. Also the Dev Teams really support the product well, replies to emails arrive within a day and they've got a good set of videos for learning how to use it.   Works well with whatever DAW you might be using and theres even videos on how to integrate with many of the big ones.  P.S. If your finding the program is slow to start there are a number of FAQs regarding audio drivers etc. For me I had to choose wait for audio engine to start a couple of times and it worked.
