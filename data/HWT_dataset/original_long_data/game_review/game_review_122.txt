Great:  - vibration feedback  - play song from YouTube  - really great VR experince  - if you love music/rythem games this is the ultimate form you can ever experience in  Can improve on:  - song searching on main UI can improve a bit: a bit hard to put in search strings every time  - maybe have a 'favorate' or 'add to library' function after found a song or a list  - more environment would be great  - resolution is too low. and somehow I couldn't find much difference of 640x480 and 1680x800  - rift please?  - Vive's display is just so pixelated - sorry not related to the game i just had to rant :)  What an experience. I can totally see how the VR can do well in games like this, which gives you an experience normal monitor/controller can't. The little vibration on the shields were just perfect. Felt so real. Now if only the Vive has as great visual as a normal monitor... Let the VR begin.
