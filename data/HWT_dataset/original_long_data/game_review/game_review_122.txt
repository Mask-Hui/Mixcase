Great: - vibration feedback - play song from youtube - really great vr experince - if you love music/rythem games this is the ultimate form you can ever experience in can improve on: - song searching on main ui can improve a bit: a bit hard to put in search strings every time - maybe have a 'favorate' or 'add to library' function after found a song or a list - more environment would be great - resolution is too low. And somehow i couldn't find much difference of 640x480 and 1680x800 - rift please? - vive's display is just so pixelated - sorry not related to the game i just had to rant :) what an experience. I can totally see how the vr can do well in games like this, which gives you an experience normal monitor/controller can't. The little vibration on the shields were just perfect. Felt so real. Now if only the vive has as great visual as a normal monitor... Let the vr begin.
