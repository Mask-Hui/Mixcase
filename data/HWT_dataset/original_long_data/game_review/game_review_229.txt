This is crazy! Almost 60 hrs and every so often having a losing streak. BUT I CAN'T STOP playing this game. Something about tinkering the deck, turn based strategy and that 'one more game' urge kept me coming back.  Losing is not something that I felt bad about*. Most of the cards are well balanced, except for some. But that's okay. It gives you thrill every time you play. I like cheap thrills. I am cheap. And you won't get any cheaper than free.   Except maybe when you buy lots of orbs to build your deck. Grumble grumble
