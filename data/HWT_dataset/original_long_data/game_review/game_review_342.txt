This game is hilarious and mowing down the hordes with 4 machine guns is quite satisfying. However this hd edition has some technical issues, notably that the controller support in the options is a lie, m&amp;k is the only option. Also the last 3 levels can be a bit annoying. Don't pay full price for it.
