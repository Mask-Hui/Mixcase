If you loved Bastion or Transistor, this game's narrative is for you.  Fun Gameplay  Good story mechanic  Beautiful graphics (although you might want to lower the graphic settings if you don't have a great computer, I did crash once)  I give this game a 8.5/10. Could use a little more polish and some narrator lines didn't match up with the dialog boxes. But overall, would recommend.
