Where do i start on this absolutely beautiful game. It's story, is absolutely charming. It has so much detail put into it, and it is a bundle of happiness, bad puns, annoying dogs, secrets. It is serious when it needs to be, but isn't a stranger to funny moments. The character design is on point, with there being various characters with various personailities and secrets to them. It sticks out from other rpg's because you don't have to kill anyone, which is an unused concept in rpg's. With lots of inspiration from earthbound, one of the best rpg's i have seen, you can tell that it is going to be good. It easily has the best soundtrack i've heard in forever. It has epic bossfights, good plot twists. The list of pros for this game are endless. If you're planning on buying undertale, i'd suggest you definitely do pacifist before anything else, because otherwise the story and bonding with characters will not be there, and it'll lose some of it's charm. I would give this game a definite 10/10
