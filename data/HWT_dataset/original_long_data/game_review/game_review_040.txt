Extremely fun game that'll only get better overtime as the devs add more features to it. The only cons right now are its matchmaking can be a little wonky, it has bugs, and if you plan on buying this to queue up with friends i reccomend waiting till the devs update that feature within a week or two. Other than that most of the cons can be fixed and the game is fun and playable now.
