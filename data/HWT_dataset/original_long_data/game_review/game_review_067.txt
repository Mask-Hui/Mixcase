I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys love stories. The graphics and sound were good enough to make the house appear eerie while walking around it. The story was great and it was one of the few times that i have almost cried while playing a game. I loved the characters and hope that more titles include characters and issues connected to the lbgtq community.
