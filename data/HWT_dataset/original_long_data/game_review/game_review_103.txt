I'm totally addicted to this game. You don't have to spend money to do okay, just keep plugging away at the tournaments and you will end up with some strong rewards, they just might not be the heroes you really wanted. Save all of your gold coins to buy extra roster slots, nothing else, and you'll level up a strong team just fine.
