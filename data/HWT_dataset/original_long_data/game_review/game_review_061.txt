+rpg levelling +wide-variety of ship types +physics-based movement for both ships and projectiles/missles +easy-to-learn resource management +dark humored -grind intensive (if under utilizing the civvy station types) -sub-par ai teammates -low variety of equipment types -low variety of levelling skills (that is, no branching) listen, this game is fun as hell. Despite my minuses up there, there is still some variety and strategy to be had. It starts off fast and still really picks up. Even though there's a low variety of equipment, it still feels like there's always another ship to unlock or skill to level up. The best way to increase the life of this game is the mods. Fight for universe is easily the star, but big fight for beef is also very good. Even though spaz 2 is out, this is still definitely a buy.
