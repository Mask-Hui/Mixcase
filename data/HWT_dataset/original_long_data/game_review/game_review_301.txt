This game left me wanting more. I'm sure I could squeeze another playthrough out of it but I had mixed feelings about the ending I got. I still recommend this game if only to play through it at least once. There are some really cool mechanics I haven't seen used much, if at all, in other games. As far as scariness, I have nerves of steel when it comes to these types of games so I cannot comment on that entirely but will say that there are some pretty amazing moments that I could see scaring others.
