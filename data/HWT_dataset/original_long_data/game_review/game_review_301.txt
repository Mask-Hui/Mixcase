This game left me wanting more. I'm sure i could squeeze another playthrough out of it but i had mixed feelings about the ending i got. I still recommend this game if only to play through it at least once. There are some really cool mechanics i haven't seen used much, if at all, in other games. As far as scariness, i have nerves of steel when it comes to these types of games so i cannot comment on that entirely but will say that there are some pretty amazing moments that i could see scaring others.
