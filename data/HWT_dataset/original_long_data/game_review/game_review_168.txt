Well executed stealthy combo masher, with some RPG elements, and parkour set in the beloved Middle Earth. The unique nemesis system never feels gimmicky, and will keep you excited for the next big fight or a chance to avenge one of your steam friends. Most fun I had playing a LOTR game, or any game released this year for that matter. Looks very good and runs great on my 2 year old PC.
