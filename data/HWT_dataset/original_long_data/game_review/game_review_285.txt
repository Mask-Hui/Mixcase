Amazing little game. The concept is so mundane but it is genuinely so entertaining to hold these little simulated lives in the palm of your hand waiting on the stamp to fall. Slowly but surely increased the difficulty. A few hours in your are scanning 5-6 different bits of paperwork but the ramp is so gradual you dont even see the difficulty increase. Starts to introduce little things to play on your mind, that maybe the place where you live isnt so good? maybe i should start letting in these decent people even though their paperwork isnt so good? what about these shady resistance characters? what about this guy who is clearly mentally ill trying to get home but his passport is written in crayon? you need to balance all of this with your family who rely on your wages, wages that will be cut if you get caught letting people in illegally/erroneously. The graphics look simple, the concept looks simple, but this game will stir things inside of you. It will make you realise how much of a bureaucratic fascist or peace loving do-gooder you are. That, to me, is what games are all about. Buy it.
