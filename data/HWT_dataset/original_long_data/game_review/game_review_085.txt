This is a pure Max Payne game. It is sorely missing a female lead to give Max something else to do besides shooting people, getting high on booze and painkillers and then complain about shooting people and getting high, but if it's the quintessentional Max Payne experience and the most stylish bullet time you want, you've come to the right place.
