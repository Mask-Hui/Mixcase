THIS GAME IS A GREAT COD GAME!  Considering the release price and season pass price. This game certainly rivals Fallout 4 which has failed to hit its falloutfanboy demographic.   If you want to relive black ops 1 or 2 then buy this game. But dont expect it to be exactly the same, it has differences both awesome and sadening (to see the memories dissapear).  The bugs are fixed this game no longer crashes. I have played for a few hours now and no problems at all.  THE VERDICT - Worhty, and fully hectic twelvie cod.
