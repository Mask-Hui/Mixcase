In my local currency this game goes for 1.70 on a 90% discount. Bought it on the premise of being a mech and fighter jet. Not disappointed, at all.  It's short, with about 4 hours of gameplay but it delivers solid fun. It's not overly complicated and does not try to be so and it's honesty is laudable.   Trust me, get it. Good arcady action that you'll lose yourself into and now it has Steam cards, for all those Steam aficionados like me.    Addendum: For those other reviews mentioning the control scheme, it's better to use mouse and keyboard than controller plug-in. With M+KB you can aim with more precision, they aiming reticule is not locked to nose only (you can shoot in 30-45 degress to the sides, up and down while flying forward).
