There was clearly no attempt at making every class as good as the other and the game is extremely unbalanced because some classes are plain awful while others are just op. The game is not at all easy for new players and the matchmaking is terrible. The game is fun because its a shooter mixed with a moba, but you obviously have to play alot to get good with certain characters (making it extremely not fun)... Or just spend money and buy the best instakill classes.
