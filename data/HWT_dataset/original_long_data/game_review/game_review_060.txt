I love this game imo its muh better than sim city, i just cant stop playing after i load up my save. Its just amazing that also have mod support, and world editor and asset maker so you can make costum buildings. Its just one of the best city builder game out there (imo) big thumps up from here, buy/try the game if you havent all ready, because its fun!
