Know what they call the magical ninja class in warframe? all of them. This game can take a little while to figure out,but once you do, it is amazing. You will feel like an awesome space ninja. With regard to the free to play model: the only pay wall is inventory space. Everything other than cosmetics can be acquired in game. Money just lets you obtain them faster. Limiting how much stuff you can have at once feels like a fair monetization system. After all, if you have played enough to need more inventory space, you should probably offer some cash as thanks. That said, it is possible to earn the cash currency through trading.
