This game.... Phew where to even start. It was absolutely beautiful, from story to graphics i was hooked. The story wasnt just some story but actually felt like i was that person, trying to figure out what came next in the story that my character was telling. Gameplay was great and i learned alot about myself through this game (mainly my fear of hights which i never had a problem with until the ice caverns). My gut churned the whole time, but i kept through for uncle fred! if you guys made a dlc or second game, i would be the first to buy it and recomend it to everyone i know. Thanks to everyone who was involved making this, you made a absolutely beautiful game.
