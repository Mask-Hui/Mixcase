This game is so.. very.. boring. I bought this game because I believed it was a PC version of 'Katamari Damacy', a popular and nice PS 2 game. Sadly it's far from it.   In this game you go about, absorbing ever bigger things to grow bigger and absorb bigger things. but the gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be, the levels not inventive and what is in it is a surreal horror show. I don't mean an entertaining horror show but, one that makes you rather depressed and rethink whether being alive is all it should be. Every 'living' creature in this game from small pets to human beings makes me wonder if the creators of this game had an interest in taxidermy.   Don't buy this game, if you really want to play something but can't get a copy of Katamari Damacy, try this link:   http://www.kongregate.com/games/dingogames/tasty-planet?acomplete=tasty+pl   shorter and sweeter.
