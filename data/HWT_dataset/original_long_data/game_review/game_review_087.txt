It's not hard for me to see why other people like this game, but it wasn't for me. For one thing i have a vive and i'm much more interested in playing room sized games with the controllers. Beyond that, the game is initially awe inspiring in the scale of its universe, but i also felt that same scale was a hinderence to my enjoyment. The learning curve and the amount of time to do anything interesting at the beginning were both too large for me. Perhaps if i were more patient and had more time for gaming this would be compelling to me. But i don't have either and there are plenty more vr games i'd rather spend my time on.
