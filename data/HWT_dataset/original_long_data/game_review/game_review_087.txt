If there's a single concept that sums up how this game plays, it's the strength of your technology versus the fragility of your flesh. No matter how much research you do to improve your hacking capabilities and the gadgetry you wield, there's no way to make yourself run faster or survive any longer against a hail of bullets. The game's central power fantasy is to mess with online-connected devices in ever more elaborate ways, while its central challenge is how to maneuver your fragile self past guards, robots, and security lasers to get to various important devices that have been isolated from the internet. This combines into a character with massive offensive and limited defense who either dies quickly or wins spectacularly, and it's an absolute joy to figure out ways to win against high odds and bring down every guard in your way. Or you could just bumble a little rc car through air vents until you get it close enough to the target computer to stick a usb in and start hacking. That works, too.
