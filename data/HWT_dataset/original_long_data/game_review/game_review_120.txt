I want to start off by saying this game is not baldur's gate or nwn. There are some serious issues with the game play and i personally think it is very dumbed down. Having said that, the game is fun for what it is. I'm hoping that the developers quickly release patches in order to fix some issues and add content. My fear is that they are going to force us with dlc in order to get the game to be playable and it won't be playable for the next 2 years. I'm hoping i'm wrong and that is why i am giving the game a positive review because i believe it can be saved.....if the developers will listen to the playerbase. Diablo 3 was a steaming pile of poo when it released and it turned into something fairly decent.
