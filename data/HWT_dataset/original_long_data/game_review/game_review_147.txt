Went on this expecting a bit more of a blackpool pleasure beech but got more like alton towers not bad really but the scarty thing is maybe this game makes you feel like a reel rolingcoaster designer so could have an impact onn the real enginerrsing and talent that goes into making the actual rolloncoaster as well as this the finances are ok but ressession has struck and the game dosnt take into account the constatn decline in inflation prices and money costs as well as the overall lowerd amount of money that the average man can take and spend in the theme park
