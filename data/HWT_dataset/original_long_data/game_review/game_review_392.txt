4k+ at 60fps (gtx 970), dual audio options and includes neptune gear. What's not to love? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nygsb617tmo excellent port and a great entry point if new to the series. Just keep in mind there is lots of (skip-able) talking. As usual would suggest using a gamepad but personally i had no problems with a keymouse/mouse setup, both completely rebindable. Price is about right and wouldn't have been unhappy about a purchase. More then half the dlc is included free, which is still plenty to play with. Recommended game to all jrpg/anime/visualnovel fans, provided you don't mind long breaks between the action. Cheers.
