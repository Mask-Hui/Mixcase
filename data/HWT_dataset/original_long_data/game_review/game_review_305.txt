Fun little game, which is highly addictive. The art style is like battle block theater. The goal is the game is to beat a variety of increasingly difficult levels while powering up your disposable little hero. Every time you try you will be a little bit strong (and wiser) than before making it easier to beat the levels. The game is very unforgiving and you will die a lot, but it's allright since there are enough hero's to take the place of your fallen one!   I would recommend this game!
