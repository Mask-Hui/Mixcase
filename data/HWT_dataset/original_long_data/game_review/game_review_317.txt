Damn fine AAA FPS shooter - that's the bottom line.  It's looks, sounds and plays great - great fps mechanics, nice story, cool characters, flawless voice acting, and a badass soundtrack. Not for the faint hearted though - some of those cutscenes were pretty darn cruel and vivid.  But when a game overall is so great, it's easier to spot the flaws, and here they are as I saw 'em:  - No SLI support - wtf? I had to put the game away until I upgraded my card, as it ran too poorly on my old dual gpu GTX 590. Make sure you have a fairly decent single gpu card. - Stupidly small obstacles are often unclimbable. - Enemies walking through walls - Maybe I'm just thick, but it was unclear to me when my weapon was actually doing damage, or if I was wasting bullets on an inpenetrable armor. - A few really low res textures despite highest setting - Having to press a button to pick up ammo/armor is stupid - Giving you the option to pick up a 'special' weapon that has no ammo is stupid - Quite heavy reuse of large geometry sections - If you go to a recharge station and you're not being shot at - you should automatically recharge both battery powered weapons - Sorta anti climatic end game boss fight  88%
