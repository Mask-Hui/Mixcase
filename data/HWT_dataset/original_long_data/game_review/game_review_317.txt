Damn fine aaa fps shooter - that's the bottom line. It's looks, sounds and plays great - great fps mechanics, nice story, cool characters, flawless voice acting, and a badass soundtrack. Not for the faint hearted though - some of those cutscenes were pretty darn cruel and vivid. But when a game overall is so great, it's easier to spot the flaws, and here they are as i saw 'em: - no sli support - wtf? i had to put the game away until i upgraded my card, as it ran too poorly on my old dual gpu gtx 590. Make sure you have a fairly decent single gpu card. - stupidly small obstacles are often unclimbable. - enemies walking through walls - maybe i'm just thick, but it was unclear to me when my weapon was actually doing damage, or if i was wasting bullets on an inpenetrable armor. - a few really low res textures despite highest setting - having to press a button to pick up ammo/armor is stupid - giving you the option to pick up a 'special' weapon that has no ammo is stupid - quite heavy reuse of large geometry sections - if you go to a recharge station and you're not being shot at - you should automatically recharge both battery powered weapons - sorta anti climatic end game boss fight 88%
