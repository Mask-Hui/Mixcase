Great game ! Tons of replayability and very fun zombie survival game ! Def. in my top 5 zombie games ever played.   Edit: After playing 60+ hours i can honestly say this is one of the better more ''realistic'' zombie games. It's very much designed like a survival horror as you must save up your ammo, heal your own wounds when you bleed out, take pills when youre infected, etc. Also, I find zombies to feel very natual to be well animated for a free to play game.   P.S. : I would recomend getting 1 or 2 friends to play with, but the community is super friendly and you can usually make friends/talk with the people in the chat or over voice comms.
