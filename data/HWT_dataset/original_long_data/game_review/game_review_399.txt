Great game ! tons of replayability and very fun zombie survival game ! def. In my top 5 zombie games ever played. Edit: after playing 60+ hours i can honestly say this is one of the better more ''realistic'' zombie games. It's very much designed like a survival horror as you must save up your ammo, heal your own wounds when you bleed out, take pills when youre infected, etc. Also, i find zombies to feel very natual to be well animated for a free to play game. P.s. : i would recomend getting 1 or 2 friends to play with, but the community is super friendly and you can usually make friends/talk with the people in the chat or over voice comms.
