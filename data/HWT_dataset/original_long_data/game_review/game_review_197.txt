Dissapointingly boring, if pretty, new IP. For patient stealth nuts only.  Pro's. Origional, love the goblin anti-hero idea. Steampunk and overall aesthetic is amazing for a $29 title. Voice acting, graphics and overall production quality is on par with many AAA titles. The balance of stealth to combat is refreshing, it feels fair that the goblin can't take on hordes of soldiers and adds to the excitement. Aside from the crazy ragdoll here and there I experienced no glitches, audio or graphical issues of any kind and the game runs smooth even on an older system.  Con's. Almost no plot, character development, intrigue, you either don't know whats going or you just don't care. World and characters aren't fleshed out, everything and everyone looks the same, you feel like you're doing the same level again and again. Gameplay is functional - but not enjoyable, a few exciting moments to be had with close shaves and near detection, but for the most part its repetative and flat. I find my mind wandering as I try to complete the same section repeatedly or even upon reaching new sections, which is often due to a guard that just happen to patrol inconvinient locations. RPG elements and progression systems barely do anything and only allow for slightly enhanced functionality. You get a new ability here and there over the hours of play, but you'll probably just complete the entire game almost entirely the same way you complete the first mission or two.  I just wish they halved the graphical production budget and gave much more love to the story, the characters and making the game interesting and dynamic.
