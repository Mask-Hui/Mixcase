Dark. Gritty. Fetid. Scury as ghouls. Notice the odd-one-out adjective there? Right, games I cannot smell. But damn, this game is so atmospheric, it's like you're experiencing smell-o-vision-gone-right. Playing it rather. This title's an asset to gaming, and Ubi's head was right for once when he said this game is 'a flawed masterpiece'. More a 'masterpieced flaw' though. Actually, no. Just play.
