If you liked witcher 1 and 2, witcher 3 is must to get. I would give normally for this game 10/10 but unfortunatly after 1.03 this game turned into buggy ♥♥♥♥ + random crashes, so remember to save really often. When i played version 1.00 -&gt; 1.03 my game never crashed, i didnt see any bugs. Also i have noticed that after 1.03 patch drawing distance sometimes is horrible, starting to draw objects when youre really close, sometimes even people. But if forgetting all these bugs, crashes and drawdistance 'bugs', this is really fantastic game, they made huge effort on quests, some of them really emotional and deep, lots of side quests, and the fact that your decision effects a lot in this game. I have played over 50 hours now and still going on. I hoped though that there would be more sidequests with old friends, like triss, zoltan etc. Even if this is buggy as hell i would recommend it, just makes me really annoyed when it randomly crash on desktop and i havent saved in a long time.
