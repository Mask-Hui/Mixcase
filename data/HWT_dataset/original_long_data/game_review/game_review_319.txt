Not bad, not bad at all. Graphics are a bit dated but, enjoyable game. Took around 26 hours to complete it. Some folks (myself included) have difficulty launching it on newer systems. Simply going into the game files and deleting the graphic.cfg file fixes that. That said, you will not want to try and adjust settings, it'll freeze the game on you. You'll be stuck with default. You'll get used to it. A lot of things are based on character level. Each level gives skill points to use to improve your character. Early on, and most fights, your character is largely a 'commander'/'placeholder' for your army while your troops do much of the fighting. Early levels; each skill point for leveling is worth 2 points for the attribute you assign them to...then 5, then higher as you go on. If you hold off spending the skill points until later on, they will spend at the higher level. Which means a lot of 'run-away' for the commander same with looting various treasure chests and, using various shrines...it's based on character level...so those can be gamed a bit, as well. For chests, i chose to take authority kicks every time, to increase the command points for better troops/more troops. Made plenty of coin just from the fights, to buy everything i needed. Think i had 250k coin at the end, even after buying all the rings, and such, that i wanted. The fights can be annoying at higher levels when trying to cover key characters. Save, fight, see how it goes...reload if key character gets killed, adjust character location within army, try again. Definitely worth the time to try, and play. (eta) the game did crash 3 times on me...each required a cad out and end process; just fyi
