I see improvement from previous one. Great BGM. And collections to achieve. You can actually flee from most of enemies.  1. But still it has terrible control, the prince usually don’t do what I want him to do, especially the right click function. They remove the disarm function. That means every time the prince meets an enemy, he must faces it and disables climbing and other stuff. 2. And limit camera, sometimes I can’t move my camera angle. So that it works terribly on the balance system because I don’t even know which button I should press  These two main problems are also found in the previous one.  In the way, it is still sucks in 2014 standard. I would say 3 out of 10 But the game worth 2.49 US$ (Previous one doesn’t, by the way)
