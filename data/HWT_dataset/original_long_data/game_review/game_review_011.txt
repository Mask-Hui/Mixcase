One of my favorite examples of racing games. It keeps a good balance between realistic physics and absurd adrenaline fueled chaos. The open world was big enough to enjoy exploring and take skill to learn, but small enough that it was easy to traverse. The car roster was a bit silly, that there was a normal and a 'good' version of each car, with most of them becoming obsolete within an hour anyways, but there was always a car that would become my 'new' favorite. It's one of those racing games where you can barrel down a street at nearly the speed of sound, forgetting to blink until you plow into a civilian and send yourself flying into the sky in a million pieces. It's just cathartic fun, in my opinion i will warn that the catharsis does take a big hit near the end-game, when the difficulty of the ai opponents is just ludicrous, but i just switched to bikes, and it remained a fun experience. If you like gran turismo or other simulation racers with a bit more crunch, this isn't for you, but it's worth a few bucks to spend an hour or two as a blur along a city street. It's never a dull moment
