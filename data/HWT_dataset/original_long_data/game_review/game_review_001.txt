It was a long while that this game was hyped up prior to release. Once the game was released and certain reviews hit, it made the game seem absolutely pristine. While it is a very well made, and enjoyable game, i think the dewed eyes of some gave it an overrated status. Still, this is well worth the time and money. The dlc seems to be interesting enough, and i hope the next installment is a bit longer at least.
