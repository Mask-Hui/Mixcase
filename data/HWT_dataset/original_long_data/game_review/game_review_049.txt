The difficult thing about reccomending a game like Depression Quest is that sharing it with someone implies that you think they'll get something positive out of it. There is no surface level positivity in Depression Quest. It is not 'fun,' it barely qualifies as a 'game' by a lot of people's standards, and it can be upsetting if played in the wrong mindset.  It is, however, highly reccommended by me as someone who sufferes from Depression.  Explaining what Depression feels like vs being 'depressed' is a battle people with Depression struggle with constantly. it is not about feeling sad, it's about feeling a complete absense of anything at best and extreme self loathing at worst. This game perfectly encapsulates how it feels to suffer from Depression, right down to the interface. The inability to choose options based on how well managed your Depression is extremely on point. If you don't have Depression, it can be frustrating that you don't have the option to speak your mind or seek professional help right away, but that is what Depression does to you. It robs you of your ability to make decisions like that, and it prevents you from looking at yourself objectively and saying 'I need help.' Some people never escape that. This game does an amazing job of capturing that feeling and putting it into words.  Do not play this game if you are looking for an entertaining 'game.' Play this game if you need help understanding someone in your life who has Depression, or if you yourself are suffering and need reassurance that you are not alone. You are not alone!
