This game attracts certain breeds of people-- Trolls, tryhards, crazies, losers, and good players. That being said, if you buy this game be prepared for being called all kinds of vile names and racist slurs at SOME point.  I'd say most of my time playing has been enjoyable. There was a huge learning curve at the beginning, and I destroyed a couple mice and put some nasty dents in my desk out of frustration. Once you learn to exploit the mechanics of the game, you'll have a lot of fun.   Its unlike any other game I've ever played-- I typically go for FPS and Third Person RPGs. Recommended if you get it on a sale.
