This game is absolutely stunning. It's like sitting through a video version of a graphic novel which you can interact with and make decisions to determine how certain events unfold. It's full of twists and turns and '...wait, huh!?' moments which just make it a fantastic story. My only and i mean only complaint is the time limit on some decisions. Some moments come up where personally, i'd like to be given some time to think about the answer rather than just going 'damn it, time's nearly up, uh th-that one!' and then squinting afterwards at whatever message comes up in the top left corner i didn't really want to see. Anything else, story, overall gameplay, voice acting, soundtrack, lower-spec computer friendly graphics, characters, all top notch. Absolutely recommend it! - 8/10.
