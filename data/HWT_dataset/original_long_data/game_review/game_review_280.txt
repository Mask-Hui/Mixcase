What i was expecting was a cute short game that would help me pass time. What i got was an amazing visual novel with more drama and story than i expected. The character development was amazing and there is so much more that meets the eye with this game. I loved playing this game and unraveling the mystery surronding it. I didn't think i would enjoy it as much i did. 10 out of 10 birds. Have and will play again.
