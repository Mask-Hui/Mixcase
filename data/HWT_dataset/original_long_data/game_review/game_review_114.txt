Probably one of the best narrative works available in gaming. Starts out somewhat formulaic in part 1, but grows steadily in complexity and depth over the 4 games, always managing to have new surprises in store. Extremely well written, extremely engaging, and your choices genuinely do continue to have impact throughout the whole story. An absolute must-read. Nb: i played the whole thing on mobile before buying it all again on pc
