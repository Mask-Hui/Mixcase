If you've ever wished Dark Souls and Castlevania:SotN would get their freak on together, buy this game.   Great gameplay and exploration that really fuses the best aspects of Souls-style games and Metroidvanias.  Tough, deliberate, but fair combat. The right amount of hidden areas and backtracking once you unlock new skills.   The skill tree system does a great job blending both hard requirements to use equipment and stat balance.  Already finished one playthrough, started a second character, and moving into NG+ with the first.  Really hoping there's more content or sequels released just for how well this game was executed.
