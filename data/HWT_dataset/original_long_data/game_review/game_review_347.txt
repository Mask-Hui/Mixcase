Undertale comes together to make something greater than the sum of its parts. The graphics are solid for a retro title and the music is nice, but paired together they make some truly beautiful and impacting moments. The script runs the gammut from comedic to dramatic to heartbreaking to hopeful, sometimes all at once, and does this while turning RPG tropes on their head. And all of this without touching on the world, characters, story, gameplay... I could write whole pages about it. But instead, I'll just say this:  If you like RPGs, play this game. If you like video games, play this game. If you have seven free hours between now and your death, play this game.
