They basically fixed Shadow Warrior (2013) i.e. the bossfights are awesome, weapons feel very nice (maybe not as good as D44M's ones, but still solid), enemies aren't too spongy (if you're not too much of a retard with handling elemental and upgrade stuff). The upgrade system is really balanced and once you get around it, it's not too tedious. The elemental stuff and limited ammo softly forces you to use different weapons. Lots of cool unique (being the important word here while comparing SW2 to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Borderlands' formula of 'RNG' weapons) weapons that stay viable through most of the game. The music is great, especially the main theme and of course Stan Bush's stuff. Randomly generated levels may seem repetitive, but the level chunks have really great artstyle and maneuverability, designed to launch yourself around with dashes, that are kinda broken in a good way. I don't understand why there are so many lore books, I doubt anybody actually read them. The humor is mostly hit or miss, just like in the 2013's version (shoutout to PC Gamer getting triggered by a tranny joke and Genocider gun,  really ). Highly replayable. Oh, and don't worry, you can turn off those ugly damage numbers, I recommend doing that.  And the most important thing:  YOU CAN GO FAST, REALLY ♥♥♥♥ING FAST , I actually think it's broken sometimes how fast you can go (which is great).  Solid choice for GOTY, which is really sad because it shouldn't be.
