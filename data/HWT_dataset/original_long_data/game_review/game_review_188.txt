I experienced no performance problems even at release, and after all these patches it plays really well. IMO, this is a really great and fun game in truth, although the format may be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story).   I particularly enjoyed the 'Dual Play' segments (where you can play Batman + 1 more), and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your Batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the APC commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the breaks to skid around corners (and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable!)  Summary: ++ I had plenty of fun overall and enjoyed my time with the game + Main game was plenty fun and I got to 97% completion (might go for 100%.. we'll see).  + AR Challenges are back, are integrated somewhat into the main game, and allows you to play with a wide variety of characters + The vehicle segments are actually pretty fun game playwise - Some parts of the story feel contrived, such to fit in vehicle gameplay/combat - The format where more and more enemies repopulate every time you progress the story is also pretty contrived - Some of the Most Wanted missions can feel a little grindy...
