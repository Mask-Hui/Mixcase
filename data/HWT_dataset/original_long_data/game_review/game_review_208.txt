This game is great. It's laughable reading the negative reviews from people who haven't even played for an hour. Also it's not pay to win, it just requires you to build and use your team effectively. There are some features I would like to have available... mission editor, more control over direction of facing your soldier, freedom to select the skirmish you would like to play... but dude, it's free! If you like turn-based tactical games give this game a try (and play for more than an hour before you wuss out!) It is truly fun.
