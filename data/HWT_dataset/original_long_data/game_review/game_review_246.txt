Personal rating: 8 of 10 great fun for the young and adult. Scribblenauts is a puzzle adventure games where you travel from one map to another and help the characters residing in the area by creating and manipulating objects! you can create from animals to robots to even becoming zeus yourself. The game offers unlimited space for your imagination and creativity. Play with your family and kids as this seems to be a great platform for learning as well. However, you can only create objects that are not copyrighted and the objects comes in limited visuals; but this can be overcome by downloading objects designed by other players or create your own in the editor.
