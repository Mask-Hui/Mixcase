Absolutely love this game! Even though I haven't played it as much as other people but the gameplay is awesome, graphics aren't complete ♥♥♥♥ but the ambience of the game is just amazing. The music, don't even get me started on the music. The music on this game is brilliant and is just so catchy. As some people would say, 'Damn yo. This mixtape is fire' 10/10 -IGN
