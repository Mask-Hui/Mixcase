I'd actually call this one of the better titles in the silent hill series, though i haven't played the newer games since they're console-only. The combat isn't amazing, but it's more fluid than in the previous titles. This makes up for the lacking story, which i'll admit is a bit dull. The atmosphere is amazing and the graphics are about on-par with the technology at the time it was released. The boss fights have a really unique animation style that i can't say i've seen much in other games. It reminds me of a higher-quality claymation. Yes, it has its flaws, but if you're looking for a more combat-oriented silent hill game, along with some good settings, i'd suggest picking this up.
