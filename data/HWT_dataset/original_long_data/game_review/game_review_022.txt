I'd actually call this one of the better titles in the Silent Hill series, though I haven't played the newer games since they're console-only. The combat isn't amazing, but it's more fluid than in the previous titles. This makes up for the lacking story, which I'll admit is a bit dull. The atmosphere is amazing and the graphics are about on-par with the technology at the time it was released. The boss fights have a really unique animation style that I can't say I've seen much in other games. It reminds me of a higher-quality claymation. Yes, it has its flaws, but if you're looking for a more combat-oriented Silent Hill game, along with some good settings, I'd suggest picking this up.
