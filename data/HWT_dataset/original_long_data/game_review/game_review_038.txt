Short review incoming: do you wanna know which penumbra game is the weakest of the bunch? this one. It's even worse than the first installment. No horror elements this time. Just randomly secluded puzzles and a weak conclusion of the whole story in the end. I would give this game a thumbs up if the puzzles were good, but no, they're terrible.
