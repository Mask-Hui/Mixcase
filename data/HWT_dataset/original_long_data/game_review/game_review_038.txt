One of the most enthralling visual novels i've read that revolves around economics and characters that intermingle in stock trading. This is a visual novel foremost that involves no gameplay and no decisions that effect the outcome of the plot, you pretty much read right of the bat until you reach the conclusion of the story. That said, it ends on a cliff-hanger, which alludes to a episode 2, meaning there's another episode to fill in the gaps. Personally, i can't wait for episode 2, the ending left me awestruck by the sudden turn of events. Overall, i enjoyed reading this visual novel, looking forward to what happens in the next episode.
