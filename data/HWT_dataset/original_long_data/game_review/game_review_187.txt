I turned all the graphics options off or down as low as they'll go and it's still virtually unplayable for me... Not to mention the ages i spent toggling the controller setup so my protag handled like a shopping card with only 4 wobbly wheels instead of all 4 and a bunch of extra busted wheels to add on to make acurate movement near impossible. My pc is barely a year old, it should be able to run a game this old properly...
