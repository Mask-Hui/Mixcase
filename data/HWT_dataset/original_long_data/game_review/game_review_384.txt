TLDR? Go to bottom for list of pros, cons.  Lord of the rings games to my opinion tend to be good just for having that vibe. But forget about lord of the rings for a moment, because what you have here, is the one and only game that pulls it off to actually FORCE people to play together without the feeling that you are 'forced' to play together!!!! This game is all about the team.  You have a ranger (DPS), a warrior(tank) and a loremaster(support) class. Each class as before mentioned having their own task. Loot is given to each individual, which negates fighting over loot. The loremaster will have crappy damage, but great supportive skills, the tank can take a lot of damage and aggro, while the ranger has low health but can deal massive damage. Besides this, areas can only be finished when everyone is together, but the action always leads you towards it. Besides this great job, is the story compelling and very similar in feeling to the movies.  Pros: - Great story - Best co-opperative gameplay EVER! - Great combat mechanics (per class different) - Reasonable replayability (switching of classes) - Good leveling mechanics that keep you compelled.   Cons: - Medium to short campaign. - Ranged attack is too spot on.  When in doubt. Buy this game!
