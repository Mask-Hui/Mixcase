Great little choose-your-own-adventure game, very worth the small price. The art style looks nice, and the writing got more than a few chuckles out of me. There are even nice atmospheric touches like changing the look of the tavern as the game progresses and giving you new music about halfway through (to give you a break from the track you've probably been playing for the past half hour). It took me two playthroughs and a little over an hour and a half to figure out how to get to the end of the story, but there are several factions you can focus on, so i'll probably play through it a few more times just to see more of the dialogues. If you find you're stuck, use the 'management' mode instead of story mode. It'll show the rewards of all possible actions, so you can make better decisions about how to build the stats you need.
