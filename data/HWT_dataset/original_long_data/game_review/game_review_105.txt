It has its issues with the connection but still fun. And free, which make it much more fun. Maybe its gonna be okay until the dlc come and the hole game is become fully Pay to Win, but right now the Deck builder is fine, you got single player campaign, and the most fun part is that you can play against other players. If you played any Magic in your life then you should try it.  And if the game says 'Unkown Error' in the starting update windows.
