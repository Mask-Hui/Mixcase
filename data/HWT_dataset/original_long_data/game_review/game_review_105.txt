Akin the first game, L4D2 has everything that was in Left 4 Dead 1 except ONE thing: respect for it's predecessor. I enjoyed Left 4 Dead 2, yes. But when it's all said and done, I always go back to the original for what the game Left 4 Dead is REALLY all about.  The Main reason I do not reccomend playing this game is for three reasons: 1. Gameplay is fustrating in advanced multiplayer levels 2. Console customization and game hosting customization is difficult. 3. Lack of Ambiance for a Horror game.  The sequel might have game modes. It might look different. It might have more jokes. It might have more infected. It might have more weapons. But by golly, it's a totally different game. And it doesn't feel right. 700 Hours in both games has told me one thing: Left 4 Dead 2 has no respect for the Original Left 4 Dead. It was meant to replace and make obsolete it's parent.  There are a lot of irregularities in gameplay that make Left 4 Dead 2 feel fake, but I would have to say the greatest missing ingredient from this Horror game is Ambience.
