you can see by the hours I put into this game that I enjoy it. This is everything I wished a search game from cod would be. But dont buy this game thinking its like cod, battlefield, or any other shooter game. its a game in its own class and should be treated as such. Cant tell you how many times I hear new players ♥♥♥♥♥ and complain about getting killed really fast. Oh god forbid you get shot in the face and ♥♥♥♥ing die. It's not like that doents happen in real life or anything.   Edit:Ok so ive been playing this game for awhile now. Thrown all kinds of money at it. One of the best MP games around. A good thing to play when your your not feeling CS:GO.  Nominating for the The “Test of Time” Award so CS:GO has something to fight for.
