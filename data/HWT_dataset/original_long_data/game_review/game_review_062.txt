You can see by the hours i put into this game that i enjoy it. This is everything i wished a search game from cod would be. But dont buy this game thinking its like cod, battlefield, or any other shooter game. Its a game in its own class and should be treated as such. Cant tell you how many times i hear new players ♥♥♥♥♥ and complain about getting killed really fast. Oh god forbid you get shot in the face and ♥♥♥♥ing die. It's not like that doents happen in real life or anything. Edit:ok so ive been playing this game for awhile now. Thrown all kinds of money at it. One of the best mp games around. A good thing to play when your your not feeling cs:go. Nominating for the the “test of time” award so cs:go has something to fight for.
