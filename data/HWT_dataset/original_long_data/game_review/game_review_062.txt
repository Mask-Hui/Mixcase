Almost offensively bad. I got it for free and it still wasn't worth it. A short list:  The presentation is horrible. Awful 10-second no effort looping clips, sprites that aren't even given effort to match with the background, horribly stilted writing that tries to hard to be referential and 'edgy' without being clever and a completely unpolished U.I. and control scheme.  Then the game itself. Voices are jumbled together, making anything said an unintelligible mess. The sprites don't even look completely animated for most of the time, instead cobbled together and hidden behind meaningless flashes in a desperate hope that you don't see the errors. No trace of hitstun or even intelligible hitboxes, as punches whiff through a person's head or kicks that don't make contact deal damage.  The controls are rudimentary and almost insultingly simplistic, giving you the glorious options of 'mash attack' or 'hold a direction and mash attack', with a fireball move that isn't worth the bar buildup and a dodge move that decides on some random basis whether to work or not.  I beat the first enemy, put it in my 'shitcan' list and wrote this review. And I hope that's the last I hear of Banzai Pecan.
