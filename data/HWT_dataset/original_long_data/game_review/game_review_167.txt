This point&amp;click game may use an outdated game engine and contain fairly low quality graphics but those factors do not get in the way of an enjoyable story and high quality voice acting. WadjetEye has impressed me with The Shivah and it has managed to do it once again. On the negative side, some of the text was different from the voice acting, but that will not get in the way of being a memorable and enjoyable game. Playtime goes as far as 3 hours, and considering there are 5 games in the series. I totally recommend this title, and if what you see you will enjoy it, then don't hold back! Get the bundle on sale and you'll be good to go! (the bundle only contains the first four titles - be sure to get the last one as well for the conclusion :D)   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=460676760
