Cant get past the part where you have to tail that one guy and kill him but overall enjoyed jumping of buildings and telling people to take a seat beafore i stab them in the neck. 10/10 would desyncronize again but seroiusly a good game lots of fun my only problem is that every time i wanna play i cant use steam i gotta go into my windows search thing and find uplay then run as admin or it wont work also the sexual themes is a lie the only sexualy thing is when the candel goes out in that one scene
