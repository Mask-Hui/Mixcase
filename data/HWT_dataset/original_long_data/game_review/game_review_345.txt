If your on the fence get down from there. Why are you up there anyway? fantastic concept and great execution. I was interested in the game for the concept and art design, but was suprised that it had such a good story as well. Don't go into it expecting an award winning story, but it will keep you entertained the whole time. The writing is very witty. It's definitely worth the purchase.
