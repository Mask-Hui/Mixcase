If you want to play a cyberpunk game with many customizations for you character and loadout and a great high-tech atmosphere then give this game a try. So firstly, The pros (in General) 1) Customizable weapons and character 2) Free Hero and Weapon Every week 3) Great maps 4) Lots of Gamemodes (Specially the Onslaught) 5) Rewards every level 6) The Devs respond to my e-mails 7) 2 Free Loadout slots 8) Weapon and Character Stats 9) Depot ( Where you can get flamethrowers, rocket launchers and a Hardsuit) 10) Some players are friendly 11) The video settings can be maxed out or lowered depending on your PC specs.  Next is the Cons 1) Horrible Spawning at Deathmatch Maps (Mostly At Helodeck, Depends on how many players are playing in that lobby) 2) Spawncampers 3) Hard to earn GP (You should play for hours to get your unlimited gun part or weapon) 4) Expensive Items 5) No updates 6) Errors and crashes which makes dump files that occupies hundred megabytes in my hard drive (can go up to 10GBs(the same size as the game) if you're not aware of that)  (So all of these are just my opinion, If you want to play this game then give it a try.) All in all, I still recommend this game because of its unique customization.
