Soma is not a horror game like frictional games' previous titles (penumbra &amp; amnesia) rather it is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller. +setting is really grim, you should take your time and look around, the more audio logs you listen to and personal notes you read, you will witness how last members of the human race desperately strive to survive +puzzles are not abstract, they are smart and fit to the setting. +strong themes and philosophical debates on transhumanism, existentialism and the concept of identity. What makes us human, our biological entity or consciounsness? that is the question that will haunt you at the end. -game mechanic is the only problem in soma, it is limited and mediocre, there is no improvement after amnesia. Alien isolation is a perfect example of how crafting and inventory management improve gameplay experience, element of horror and storyline. Frictional games is definitely on the right track and soma is their real masterpiece. I am looking forward to their next title. 2105 out of 10
