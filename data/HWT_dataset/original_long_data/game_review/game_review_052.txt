This game is a masterpiece.   Some flaws due to the open-world design, for instance rewards from exploration become obsolete due to how much better gear is from crafting, which makes exploration in the mid-to-late game near pointless. Besides that, this game is nearly flawless and truly the triple A RPG we've been asking for for the past 10 years.
