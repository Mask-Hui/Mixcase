It's like a faster futuristic looking version of that Jet Slalom game from back when people used 'bonus.' If you know it you know it lol Great game though even if you don't get the nostaligia, new level every day, good amount of achievements and you can play it for 20 minutes at a time and feel totally satisfied, I recommend it as a mini game for sure.
