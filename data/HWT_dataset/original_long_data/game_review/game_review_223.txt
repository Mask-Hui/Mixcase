Never before have i sat down and played through a whole game in one sitting, even games shorter than this. The characters, voice acting, story, everything really kept me on the edge of my seat wanting to know what happens next. I would 100% reccomend this game to anyone who is looking for a break from other big budget explosive competitive games and wants to take a step back and enjoy a great story and a great game.
