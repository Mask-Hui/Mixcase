Let me start off by saying i did not purchase eu when it first came out and that i got it on sale which included ew so i never experienced the issues that some people claim to have had with that game. I loved that game however, it was unforgiving in the early stages but rewarding when you did things right. As for xcom2 i love it, the game plays pretty well for me on medium and i am running a gtx560 with 2gb of vram. At first the game set it to high and it was running a bit sluggishly but not to the point of being unplayable but when i dropped it down to medium it smoothed on out. Not sure if i am just lucky when it comes to having issues with games or what but it seems that most of the negative reviews sound like they are coming from some really entitled people. Loving the story so far though and it plays alot like eu/ew and the turn limit makes you have move quickly instead of taking your sweet time. Some people claim this reduces your ability to strategise but i would argue it forces you to be more fluid with your tactics. The revamped classes are familiar but also have a new feel and things that they can do. All in all i would give this game a solid 9/10 though this may change up or down once i have had more time to play and when/if i have any of the graphical issues others are having.
