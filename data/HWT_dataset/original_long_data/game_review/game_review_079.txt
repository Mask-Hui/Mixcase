First of all, i bought this game when it was out for month for just 5â‚¬. And what did i get for such a ridiculous price? nothing short of a brilliant game. It's old-school first person shooter with a little twist. Meele combat. It has style, it's gory and it's just overall satisfying way to play. Thanks to the little rpg elements and the fact that your katana gets upgrades as you progress through game, it remains viable way to play till the end. Personally, i used guns only during boss fights, well and against airborne enemies. But make no mistake gunplay feels good too. I was suprised that it even has something you could call story (well, or a reason why the ingame events are happening), and it's a decent one. Not just something like: there is a guy that wants to destroy, enslave, etc. The world because he's evil and emotionally deprived individual. Game doesn't take itself too seriously (it is obvious from the beginning), and that is a good thing. Your masked companion pulls one joke after another and lo wang has some up his sleeves aswell. Sadly, amount of funny lines noticeably tins out before first boss. But one can't save the universe with constant grin, right? it took me over 14 hours to complete this game on hard difficulty, that is quite impressive for fps. I don't play shooters, so my opinion may not be the most relevant, but this is the best shooter i have played in few years.
