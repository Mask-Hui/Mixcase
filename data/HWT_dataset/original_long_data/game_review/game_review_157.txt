If you like your Tomb Raider, old school, with lots of falling to your death and shooting exotic wildlife in the face, this is for you. It's a bit short but it's not expensive. Plays nice with an Xbox360 controller. I recommend turing off the 'Next Gen' features. If you look in the discussion threads, you can find a patch but even then, it's too glitchy.  Brace yourself for inconsistent collisions. You can shoot through some fences, but not other, identical fences. The shooting was never Tomb Raider's strong point but for a 2006 game, it feels a little like a Dreamcast game like Dynamite Cop. That's not necessarity a bad thing.  The story is pretty lousy. I kind of zoned out, to be honest. There are some quicktime action sequences which are rather pointless. There are serious bugs all over the place so you may have to refer to a walkthrough here and there.  But even with all it's flaws, if feel just a little bit like Tomb Raider 2 and that's enough for me to recommend it.
