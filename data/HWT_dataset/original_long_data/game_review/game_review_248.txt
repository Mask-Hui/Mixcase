Jump into the air, shoot someone in slow motion, bring my fists to a gun fight and win. That pretty much sums up my experience in double action: boogaloo. After about an hour and a half. This game is a lot of fun! not going to deny. Not my flavour but still a lot of fun. I highly recommend this game if you just want to have some silly online fun. ^,^
