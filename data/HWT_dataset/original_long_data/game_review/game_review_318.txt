This game is Beautiful, visually stunning and has a great art-style. Gameplay wise is pretty good combines abit of action RPG with some strategy in the mix, combat system feels very unique and fluid. In short I Loved this game, gameplay was solid, soundtrack was sublime. Top notch indie game! Only draw backs i would say is story can be abit hard to follow at times so be sure to check terminals for bits of the plot. Another thing is that this game seems a little short I think the devs could have streched it just little further. But I'm still gonna rock with this on a new game +
