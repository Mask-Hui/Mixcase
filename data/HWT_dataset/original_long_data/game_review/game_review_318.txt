This game is beautiful, visually stunning and has a great art-style. Gameplay wise is pretty good combines abit of action rpg with some strategy in the mix, combat system feels very unique and fluid. In short i loved this game, gameplay was solid, soundtrack was sublime. Top notch indie game! only draw backs i would say is story can be abit hard to follow at times so be sure to check terminals for bits of the plot. Another thing is that this game seems a little short i think the devs could have streched it just little further. But i'm still gonna rock with this on a new game +
