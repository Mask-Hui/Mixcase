Hard, totally unforgiving and absolutley a good time. Captaining a ship and managing your resources in the face of certain doom requires a bit of stoicism and masocism, it may be an aquired taste. The bits of the story, infite variations of componets/weapons (allowing for many playing styles and stratagies) and discovered ships add to replaybility. Good music too.
