Apparently I'm one of the few people for whom this game is actually working atm. But I can say from what I've played so far this is a decent game. It has no multiplayer (anything worth mentioning anyway), and other things, so it doesn't really feel like 60 bucks yet. Maybe one day. I would also say if you were expecting this to be some sort of cancerous multiplayer survival game, don't buy it. It is strictly Space Exploration, which means its not meant for the challenge or competition, but the scenery and journey.
