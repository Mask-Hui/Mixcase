The game is just a generic 3rd person shooter. It looks good, feels good shooting people and contains lots of explosions and gunfire, the story is ok-ish too. Apart from that, there is nothing this game offers other than a very short playthrough. Each level of this game is the exact same thing, no real objectives or puzzles, just shoot away until the end. I enjoyed playing this game, but it should only really be bought on sale for Â£4 or less.
