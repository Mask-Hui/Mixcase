Still a great game, solid gameplay, and a refreshingly different take on multiplayer. Ignore the reviews about the DLC - if they were really that mad, they'd have not played the game at all. None of the day 1 DLC was 'pay to win,' and plenty of games have reskins or retextures. A cosmetic option shouldn't be the reason you boycott a game - no one's making you buy the skin packs, and no one's going to force you to buy the other DLCs either. Enjoy the game if it's fun, but don't be a hypocrite and complain while still playing the game for more hours than you've worked this week.
