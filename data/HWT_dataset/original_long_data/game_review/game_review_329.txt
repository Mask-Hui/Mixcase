Empire Total War is the best Total War game, ever, until the bring out Empire Total War 2 obviously.  This game is perfect once you get the hang of it, but if you already know from past experiences like Rome Total War, or Napoleon Total war then you will just fit into this game perfectly. The game is based around the 1700s colonization of the Americans, and if you get powerful enough, Europe or India. The game is pefect for Hard core Total War fans, and just all round for people who like Military Strategys.
