Re-used maps from the first Xenoverse, nothing really much changed to where you play the same campaign just a little different. Not all your items from the first game that you worked hard on gets transferred to the second game (Even some DLC). It feels like I am playing the first game again but just more shinier things. No way am I going to pay 60$ for this.
