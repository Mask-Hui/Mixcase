Fun solo poker game. Fun characters with well developed character tells. The table, cards, and scenario changes increase replayability. The game would benefit from additional poker styles apart and gimicks apart from drinks. Having a few more styles apart from omaha and hold 'em as well as more characters would further increase replayability. Finally, i wish it had multiplayer, or online poker features where people could trade or bet using steam funds or game items. That would be a blast. What is missing the most is a multiplayer element. I hope it is added for poker night 3. Thanks!
