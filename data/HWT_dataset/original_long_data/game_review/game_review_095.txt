Re-used maps from the first xenoverse, nothing really much changed to where you play the same campaign just a little different. Not all your items from the first game that you worked hard on gets transferred to the second game (even some dlc). It feels like i am playing the first game again but just more shinier things. No way am i going to pay 60$ for this.
