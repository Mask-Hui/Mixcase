Risk of Rain is a game where you'll probably die a lot to start with. The game has you fighting through hordes of enemies, jumping from teleporter to teleporter, collecting items along the way.  I'd say that this game isn't really comparable to other rogue-likes such as The Binding of Isaac because of how you get your items and progress, so if you're looking for that I'd look elsewhere. It is however an incredibly addictive time waster, with satisfying art and animation, and amazing sound design.
