02/07/2014 - It's a shame I can't thoroughly recommend/enjoy this game as from the short time I've played it,I know I'd be addicted If it didn't have the following 2 game breakers.  . No Aussie servers - one red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage,and creates unbearable lag. Mind you,I played through the offline training mode and it was stuttering/lagging as well (how does that even happen?). Couple that with the poor ping,and It just ruins the game.  . Everything artifacts like crazy - the menu's,backgrounds,training and in-game. I've never had this happen before with this card and thought it might not like my OC. Set my GPU back to stock and sure enough,It didn't make a difference.   The graphics are nowhere near as bad as people make out,I actually like them. Being able to play it though is what matters,and in It's current state,this isn't the case.  Beta is no excuse,and they'll want to iron these issues out If they want real Aussie dollars.
