Nice graphics, mostly skill-based game-play. Definitely not pay-to-win. However, also no team-balancing, or at least if it exists, it's not working. To those it appeals to, gameplay is quite fast, all game-types are under time-pressure. Tactics would be possible, given that you're using some form of voip to make converse (in-game voip is actually quite usable). Negative review is mostly because i know most of the people i game with would not enjoy this game, not because the game is all that bad...
