Steam has my game time listed as 1.1 hours!!! the steam version of this game won't even launch on my pc!!! i click the roi shortcut button, i get a box that says: riders of icarus is launching... And then ... After about a minute it stops working and nothing else happens. I downloaded the game from the nexon website. Thus far its the best f2p mmorpg that i've ever played.
