Steam has my game time listed as 1.1 hours!!! The Steam version of this game won't even launch on my pc!!! I click the RoI shortcut button, I get a box that says: Riders of Icarus is launching... and then ... after about a minute it stops working and nothing else happens.  I downloaded the game from the NEXON website.  Thus far its the best F2P MMORPG that I've ever played.
