Bastion is a bloody brilliant game, with a really great storyline. Set after some calamity happened, you start to rebuild on the bastion. There's quite a lot of choice in the game, with the choice of what to build to give you an advantage, what weapons to use and what power ups to have on those weapons as well as what drinks to use to give you a bonus effect. The art style and music in the game is fantastic, everything looks so colourful at times, who says the apocolypse has to be dull. Best of all, the game has narration based on what you, the player do. So if you end up picking up a weapon then switch it for another in the armoury, the narration would say something of you taking along the new weapon. With lots of weapons, skills and customization, bastion has tons of replayability. I've heard about other modes too, but not sure what they actually are yet but will update this when i find out. The only bad thing about bastion is the combat system, which is tricky to control at times..
