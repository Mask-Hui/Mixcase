I pre-ordered this game and i have had the wonderful opportunity to watch this game grow. I played payday: the heist and i was able to learn about the characters and payday 2 has only enhanced that even more. It has an interesting and intriguing backstory that isn't so obvious in payday 2 as it was in payday 1 in my opinion nevertheless the trailers and clips that overkill, the developers, release provide that insight and give you a feel of the game that not many others are able to give you. The gameplay is fun, however it can be repetitive and for that reason it's best to take breaks from it so you don't get completely bored of it to the point where you don't want to play it again. The shooting and interaction is simple, yet decent. There is a stealth aspect for certain missions however the stealth in payday 2 feels like a botched job and it doesn't seem to really suit the atmosphere a lot of the time. Payday 2 has a bias and favour towards guns out blazing and this should be noted if you're looking for a stealthy bank robbing game. If you do manage to successfully stealth a mission however it can still feel rewarding knowing that you don't have to deal with waves of cops and everything goes smoothly. Overall payday 2 has a good backstory that keeps you wanting to breath down the developers necks to further it, the gameplay is fun and there are much more heists/contracts to choose from compared to payday 1 and it has a certain flexability that payday 1 didn't have. I would recommend this to anybody who likes to go into a situation guns blazing against waves of cops while dragging out bags of gold, cash and other valuables from the place they are robbing and yet doesn't mind the odd stealth mission for that rewarding sense of getting away quietly and smoothly. 8/10
