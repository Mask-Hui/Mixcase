I would have to say the atmosphere fits pretty well with the core XCOM experience. Outnumber, outgunned, and in the dark. Just when you think you have the tactics down, something new is put into play. Honestly the most fun I had was walking around the base and being part of the XCOM rather than a faceless commander. Sure they were a bit one-dimensional, but it was still fun to go see what the scientists were testing with reckless abandon.
