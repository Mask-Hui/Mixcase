in my opinion, its a decent shooter if your pc cant run cs:go, like any other mmofps its mostely pay to win, but who is willing to pay 15,- for a gun, that only last 30 days? exactly.  the only thing i find ♥♥♥♥♥♥, are the hitboxes, they suck. the maps are alright, you can buy decent guns for 30 games with euro's (ingame earned money)  you can have fun with this game.
