I got it for $1 off of humble, and i have to say: this game alone makes it worth purchasing that bundle. You spend the game searching keywords in order to find video clips of a series of interviews in 1984. I won't say much more about the game to avoid spoiling the plot. The game is charming in its own way as you view the clips in scrambled chronological order and try to piece together a cogent story. The game left me with a few unanswered questions as it ends, but a lot of good art does that to you. The game eventually gets a little frustrating when you try to find all of the video clips, but i eventually did and do not regret spending my 6 hours to beat this game. P.s. Don't believe the bs about this game being feminist propaganda. It is wonderfully neutral and presents everything as facts, not justifications. Final verdict: although it may no longer be on sale in the humble bundle, i still thoroughly enjoyed the game. 8/10
