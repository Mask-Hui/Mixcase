Mildly interesting, picked it up in a sale Feels totally unfinished, my friend and i teamed up and explored and got some better gear, quickly run out of PVE content it seems, unless i was missing something Killed an evening, wouldn't be paying more than a few quid for the experience however. Shame, the world is nicely detailed, feels a lot like you are in a set for 'I Am Legend'. Hopefully there is continued development as it would be a shame for a foundation such as like this to go unfinished.
