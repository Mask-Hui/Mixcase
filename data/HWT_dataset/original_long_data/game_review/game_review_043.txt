Really enjoyed playing this game. I have been playing games since the late 80's and this game reminded me of playing games like contra and metal slug. I've always had a soft spot for side scrolling shooters so when this was announced, i knew i had to play it. The stereotypical mobster takes down zombies and other mobsters to do his job for his boss! the music is very jazzy which works very well with the era it is set in and shooting zombies while jazz is playing in the background is very cool. The art is wonderful and it really is a throwback to the 90's in a way. If you are looking for a side scrolling shooter that is similar to games to metal slug or contra, get this. It feels like going back to the golden days of the arcade era :)
