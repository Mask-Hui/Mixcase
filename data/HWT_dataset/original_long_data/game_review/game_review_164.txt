I have only had this game for a few months, but in just that short amount of time, two dlc's have come out, along with patches that have made an already great game into an excellent one. The devs are very active in the community, and it really shows in the various discussion forums and dev diaries. There is a fairly steep learning curve to the game's mechanics of which i am still trying to learn; however, this breadth of strategy allows you a myriad of ways to reach goals and take advantage of certain situations. The game, in my mind, is almost infinitely replayable. I find myself sucked into every session i play regardless of how the play-through is going. My suggestion would be to buy the vanilla game (buy the dlc collection if a sale is on), and learn the base game for a partial play-through or two. Then, branch out to the dlc and other religions/cultures, where the game shows how massive it can be. Overall, one of the best strategy games ever made, and one that i'll be playing for a very long time to come.
