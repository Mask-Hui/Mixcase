Making history ii: the great war is a grand strategy game set around the time of world war i (there are two starting scenarios, one starting in 1912 and another starting before the assassination at sarajevo in 1914 going into the 1920s and the soviet revolution) this game consists of the entire world cut into small regions, accurately representing the borders and geography of all countries that existed at the time of your chosen scenario, with various populations, cities, and resources in each region. In this game (it is a turn based strategy game with each turn taking 1 week) you can choose any country in the entire world and lead that country, industrializing it, modernizing it, engaging in diplomacy with other countries, waging war, facing crisis such as rebellion, invasions, and famine. This game also implements an event system with some events that follow actual history such as the building of the panama canal, and others that will be triggered by drastically changing history such as the unification of scandinavia or the resurrection of the byzantine empire. Another interesting thing is that at any time in the game you can save your game and then resume it playing as another country (even countries that didn't exist at the beginning of the scenario you are playing) another thing that this game possesses is an internal editor that can be used to change many aspects of the game, from creating new countries to changing the values of regions such as nationality or religion. Using the editor you can create amazing new scenarios of alternate history that you can then play and publish to the main website. After about 70 hours of this game i can definitely recommend it,
