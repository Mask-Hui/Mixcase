My online experience in gta 5 on pc: went afk for a minute &gt; http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/540773470648361197/4c5f5fce27fe8e56b50569660dfd85dd104ff07c/ i name this one the rocketman &gt; http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/360651810452792224/08a399307ed2a30958f3238039785547ce97acd9/ 80645.17 k/d r seems legit to me &gt; http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/268348160034967188/6ee84bbaa3b08c55af4a66693a0efa663ebbc99b/ as long as you are not cheating yourself money,you are good to go and won´t get banned for cheating or 'modding' as the script kiddy´s would say. So if you are looking forward to play the online mode ,i can´t recommend it for pc because yea you can make private lobbys and play there with friends but you don´t have access to all game features then and if you go to a public lobby,there are usually up to 5 hackers with godmode,aimbot,nitro,teleport and alot more cheats in a full lobby(32 players),probably even more if you pi$$ the people off. /edit:it still has alot of hackers but not as many as it used to be but my only 3 negative aspects about the game(online) itself are: 1.they add more and more dumb game mode´s which nobody play and just split up the community instead of making new heists which actually would be hard and rewarding. 2.the performance of this game.you might experience heavy stuttering or crashes for some reason even with a good computer setup,whats the reason for that?there is none.you google for hours and test everything and end up that literally nothing helped.for me personally if it happens,i restart my computer and it´s fixed. 3.the desync with other players in online mode.sometimes you see someone lagging or teleporting infront of you and if you get in a car with that guy it´s starts to get ridiculous.every npc,every car,every helicopter that guy caused to spawn,is going to lagg and teleport all the time and let me tell you,this is the stupidiest thing that can happen in a heist or in a race.
