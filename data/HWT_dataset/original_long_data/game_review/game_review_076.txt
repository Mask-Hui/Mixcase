I can't keep playing this. Every single thing you do in this game is SO PAINFULLY SLOW. You will be forced to walk across zones multiple times and endure excruciatingly painful stairway and ladder animations. This game could have greatly benefitted from a fast travel or skip to next area function. The situations you get into are absurd and so is every single character you interact with. It also suffers from adventure game logic which will force you to look for a guide more often than not. I'm apparently halfway through, but I can't put up with this any longer.
