I have always been a huge supporter of indie games, so when I heard there was a game that combines RPG elements with music rhythm action I had to check it out. Be forewarned though, Sequence is not for everyone. It's bare-bones design and mildly annoying but sometimes entertaining characters and text descriptions might not appeal to everyone. But for just 5 bucks, it is hard to complain when you getting something unique and quite addictive, if you're into what it has to offer that is. The story is bland and the menus are simplistic but Sequence offers an intense, one-of-a-kind battle system that will leave you wanting more. It even supports the dance pad accessory!
