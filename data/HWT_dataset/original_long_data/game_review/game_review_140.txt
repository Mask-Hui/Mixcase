This game is really not your normal game, and i suppose you can see that from most of the screeshots. Sandbox games are powered by others, and what they create, to be honest, without downloading anything from the steam workshop, the game can get boring fast, it's loaded with 2 pre-made maps with valve to goof around and get a hang of the core components of the game. But then that's where ttt comes in (trouble in terrorist town), it's an incredibly unique game mode that's very fun and there is really nothing else quite like it. And playing a custom downloaded game mode or map can be an incredibly hilarious and generally enjoyable experience to have. Overall this game can provide endless fun if you play it in the right way. The visuals are nothing groundbreaking, but it is a almost direct port of half life 2, so if you have played it then you know what your getting into. Hope this review helped
