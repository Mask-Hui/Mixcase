This game has very quickly became my favourite game of all time for a number of reasons. 1) The fact that I love thinking whle playing games. XCOM requires you to think tacticfully at all times, from what too research to where you move your troops everything hinges on you making the right choice. 2) The replayability. Everytime I stuff up majorly I either reload a previous save or start over again. Starting over again is not a problem in this game because of how challenging the game is, the random maps and that the story is easily skippable so it doesn't feel that you are rewatching the same movie over and over again.
