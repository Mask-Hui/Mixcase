DOOM is one of my favorite games of all time. I grew up playing the 1993 version of Doom but when i saw this game at E3 2015, i was really hyped for it. When it came out, i was ready to fight like hell. The Snapmap and SP are biggest part of my experience during the time i have had this game. This Doom is like Brutal Doom and Project Brutality mixed into a 2016 game. I love this game to death. I hope a sequel to Doom comes out soon!
