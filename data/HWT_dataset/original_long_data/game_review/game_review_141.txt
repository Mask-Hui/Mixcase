Ok lets start on the pros(+) and cons(-) then my thoughts on this game.    +Some of the best charecters +good story +lods of content +customisible charecter ( you can be male or female whatever you like) +you can have a relationship with most of your companions(yes fangirls you can have a love intrest)  -bad graphics ( I dont think graphics really matter anyway) -weird and akward love scenes -invisible walls  -theirs one mission in my opinion was boring but everyone has different tastes  -+ um this isnt really bad or good but for those who care your protaginist you made cant talk  Okay know for my thoughts. I love this game. This game is probubly one of the best rpgs or games in general I have ever played.So if your a RPG fan you proubly already have this game.   Rating: 9.5/10
