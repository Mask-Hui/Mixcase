Playing on a Mac that doesn't meet system requirements and run great still! Defintely recommend it just be wary of people hacking in MP, but that is given for an old COD game.   My System for those who care (probably no one): MacBook Pro (17-inch, Early 2008) 2.6 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo 4 GB RAM  NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT 512 MB OSX Yosemite 10.10
