Really good game, surely the best WH40k game since dow2.  Very engaging campaing, that alone took me like 30 hours. Alot of small but good missions and some epic ones with fantastic music and voiceacting. Very epic feel of the story. The combat-gameplay itself is very strategic and it always feels like you have alot of options. Very recommend.
