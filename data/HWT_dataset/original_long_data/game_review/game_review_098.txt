Do not buy this game on pc! (from the day of purchase to now, this game has never loaded onto the main menu) i have 'owned' this 'game' for almost three months, and after waiting for a fix that never came, trying to fix the problem myself with no success and writting multiple forum posts on multiple sites i have finally given up trying! this game if disgustingly broken, and we as the consumers should &gt; &gt; refuse &lt; &lt; to give any of our hard earned money to a publisher who knows the state of their product, and still continues selling this garbage software despite the issues it has! however, i will acknowledge that not all pc users have been experiancing this issue, but too many (like myself) have, and it really isn't on. So please ... For the good of the pc gaming community, do not buy this game!
