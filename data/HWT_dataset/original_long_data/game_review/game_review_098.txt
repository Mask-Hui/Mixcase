It's more of a visual novel than an adventure game. You're pushing your morality on the world not solving puzzles. But it isn't the same as their other game Walking Dead season's 1+2. This game lacks the weight the Walking Dead's choices provided.  In The Wolf Among Us the choices are usually to go to one of two places and depending on where you go usually means you get to the second location too late. Scene to scene I think more things change than they did in the Walking Dead game. But I rarley feel the weight of those consequenses. They're not really moral choices they're guesses. You have a 50/50 chance of picking the right choice. Walking Dead's choices were ambigious. The point was that there was no right option. Just two different potential outcomes.   But in this game it very much feels like a right and a wrong choice and there's no way for you to know in advance. I don't feel like i'm molding a world or a character. I feel like I'm missrepresenting an established comic character. In Walking Dead Lee is the player surrogate. His opinions are your opinions. But Bigsby has an established character and I don't know what that is and it just makes me feel like I'm watching the wrong story instead of the way things should have been.   Overall it's a good game. It's just not as good as The Walking Dead.
