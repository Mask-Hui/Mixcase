One of the best games i have ever played from any genre... Goodbye t.d/t.d.u.l... Goodbye nfs... Goodbye world of bore-craft... Goodbye steam library... Goodbye life.... I am being as cryptic as i can, because you *points finger* have to be the judge of this game! 10/10 would crash head-on into the middle barrier again! if this is still too cryptic, then come alomng and say hi @ twitch.tv/barneyboy123 and see for yourself
