One of the best games i have EVER played from ANY genre... Goodbye T.D/T.D.U.L... Goodbye NFS... Goodbye World of Bore-craft... Goodbye Steam Library... Goodbye LIFE....   I AM being as cryptic as i can, because YOU *points finger* HAVE to be the judge of this game!  10/10 Would crash head-on into the middle barrier again!  If this is still TOO cryptic, then come alomng and say hi @  twitch.tv/barneyboy123  and see for yourself
