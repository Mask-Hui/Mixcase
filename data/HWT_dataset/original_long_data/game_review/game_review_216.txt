The Crew has terrible driving mechanics, and cheap ways to extend the 'story' missions as much as possible. The cars severely overcorrect, there is way too much drift even when driving at lower speeds, the acceleration and braking in every car is terrible, even with extensive upgrades, and it is impossible to make small adjustments when driving. Basically, everything that can go wrong in a driving game's mechanics has in The Crew. Add that to the frequent server down time, DRM, requirement of Uplay, and other cars in races being boosted even when you have much better parts than them, and this game is worth maybe $20, but even that's a stretch. The open world is nice, but when it's this hard to get around it, it makes an extensive map like this much less impressive. This is something I would expect from a new indie games company, not a large company like Ubisoft. Maybe they'll learn from having 3 large releases being terrible this year. If you're going to buy The Crew, wait until it's on sale for less than $20, and don't expect to get much out of the story missions, it's really only good for the open world exploration, and even then it's a stretch.
