The experience with Bastion is not just awesome and deep, it'll make anyone who plays it go inside the story and feel the anguish, passion and loneliness of 'the boy' who may save the world from pieces. The narrative and music features are briillant and the art is absolutely gorgeous. It's a must-play with no doubt.
