Alan wake is an awesome game. I'll try to be brief, because if you're like me, you won't read a big long review. At least, not all of it. Alan wake looks beautiful. Granted, it's relatively old, so it's not perfect quality, but it still looks great nontheless. The game engine also flows smoothly, avoiding choppy gameplay. Speaking of gameplay, the game is a realistic survival game. You have very limited sprint/jump abilities, so you might as well give up speedrunning through all the enemies. You face taken, who at first you must destroy the darkness inside them with your flashlight (long story), then kill them by any means necessary. There is limited ammo for your guns, so you must learn to scavenge and save precious ammo at all times. There are also no med kits, only lamp posts that you stand under to refill your health. These restrictions keep you on your toes throughout the game. The story is pretty good, but a little confusing at times. You are a famous writer who goes on vacation to take a break from doing what you do best, but your wife is kidnapped and you have no memory of what happened the past few days, as you wake in a vehicle crashed in the forest. The only thing you have to help you find your wife is your friend/agent barry and manuscript pages, mysterious pages that you wrote before the crash that depict your future. These pages are collectibles throughout the game. Like i said, it's a little confusing, but the idea of using light as a weapon is a wonderful idea. All in all, alan wake is a game that looks good, plays great, and is just fun to play. And yes, there is replay value, so it's not a waste of money. Score: 8/10 - great
