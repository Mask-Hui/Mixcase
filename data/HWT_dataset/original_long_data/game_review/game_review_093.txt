This better be the most challenging challenge of all challenges or im gonna be disappointed and have to do low level runs on new game+++++++ to get my moneys worth so dont go easy on me and as for the pvp you know your a threat to someone when they have to use teleport backstab just to beat you haha so i cant wait for that will be just like old times based on previous dark souls
