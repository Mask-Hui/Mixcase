The best Sci-Fi game of all-time and one of the all-around best games ever, this game is the pinnacle of one of the best gaming trilogies ever produced.   Mass Effect 1 had a slightly more cohesive plot line and Mass Effect 3 has more fine-tuned gameplay and mechanics, but every other facet of this game is simply amazing., there is no downside to this game.  Even if you haven't played the first installment you can pick this up without being left in the dark, although it's highly recommended that you play the first one. Not only is the first game superb as well but some of your key decisions carry over and have an impact on your story in this game. But hey, maybe you don't have the time to get into ME1, you can still purchase the Genesis DLC which is an interactive comic that lets you make all the key choices from ME1 without playing through the entire game. So that's an option.  As for this game? I think there's enough out there in some of the other reviews and I don't want to sound like a broken record, so here's what I'll say.  Have you ever played a game and felt a connection with the main character to where you actually felt like it was telling your story? Well, that's what this game is like, for everybody, and it's ****ing amazing. You get to choose nearly every dialogue option to shape the plot around what YOU would say or do, your actions and decisions actually have serious repurcussions on the plot line, you can kill off main characters, take down massive enemies and save the Galaxy in style, how you would actually do it. When playing Mass Effect you're not 'like' Shepard, you actually ARE Shepard.
