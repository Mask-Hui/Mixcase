Hands down my favorite first person shooter of all time. Run and gun rambos need not apply. Recoil and ballistics are realistic. Single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle caliber weapons almost always result in death unless it just grazes you. Rounds drop over distance and short, controlled bursts are required if you wish to remain on target. There is no magical ammunition pool. If you reload half-way through your magazine all the time then you will have a pouch full of half full mags. You can't run forever. If you sprint for a while your aim will suffer as you gasp heavily until you have caught your breath. Rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a window sill to steady your aim. Accuracy suffers when standing. Its better while crouched and even better while prone or rested on an object. The is no magical zoom button. What you see is what you see unless you have an optic. Theres nothing like having your weapon shot out of your hands as you run to take cover behind some sandbags. Then wondering if you should risk going back to try to retrieve it or wait and try to find a weapon from another fallen soldier. The graphics are dated and the bots are very dumb, but the multiplayer gameplay is still so good it makes up for it. The tank warfare can be fun too but much of my time was spent with my boots on the ground. Steam only shows 41 hours on record for me on this game but i had many hours on this game prior to when steam began tracking game time. So many late nights. The thrill of a short range firefight between 2 rifleman, both run dry and with no time to reload they rush to stab or butt-stroke(lolz) the other. So many great moments with nothing but an m44 in my hands and some panzerfausts i had found laying about as i waited to ambush a passing german tank. I had so much fun playing with the humble bolt action rifles i ended up buying a real m91/30 and m44. I was mighty fond of that lovely svt40 though...... Play this game
