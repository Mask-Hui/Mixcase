RPG classic, surely there are some bugs and 'not so pretty graphic', but the depth of the game and ideas that developers used in it - well, it definitely worth it. I played many RPGs and I can say that Two Worlds - is quite unique in this matter. I like the combat system (yes, it has some flaws, but still), I like inventory management and magic system. The characters and story is interesting as well. In short - buy it, it is 'must have' for all those RPG fans out there.
