I've been through many rpg's with many different styles. I have to say that this was just overhyped and overcooked with trailors that made the game seem better than it actually is. After playing for only two hours, i was extremely bored with the repetitive combat and dull atmosphere of the whole game. If there was a way for me to get my money back i would gladly take it. Tldr: - way too repetitive - boring gamplay - boring story (generic rpg plot) - dull
