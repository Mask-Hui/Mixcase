I've been through many rpg's with many different styles. I have to say that this was just overhyped and overcooked with trailors that made the game seem better than it actually is.  After playing for only two hours, I was extremely bored with the repetitive combat and dull atmosphere of the whole game. If there was a way for me to get my money back I would gladly take it.   TLDR: - Way too repetitive - Boring gamplay - Boring Story (Generic rpg plot) - Dull
