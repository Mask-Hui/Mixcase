I think this assassin's creed nailed the mechanics down on all fronts (ship battles, sailing, hunting (fish), parkour, etc). I felt much more attached to this character as well. The story starts out extremely rough but does get much much better as you play (i think this is with every AC game personally). Edward was quite the interesting character and so was all the side characters. I felt like all the collectables actually meant something in this AC game that I never got from any of the previous ones and maybe its because I felt like they had a bigger purpose in the game. They def were not required but they were fun to get and you got rewarded in a very balanced way. Everything from killing sharks, whales, deer, monkeys, to fighting royal fleets and boarding ships, to taking out massive watch tower like bases, to finding secret bottles and uncovering buried treasure was just FUN! I got sucked into doing these things than actually playing the main storyline. I wil probably keep playing this game even though I am done with the main quests. This is by far the strongest AC game to date in my honest opinion.  Also spoiler: Edward - Father to Haytham's (templar) who is father to Ratonhnhake (Assassin)
