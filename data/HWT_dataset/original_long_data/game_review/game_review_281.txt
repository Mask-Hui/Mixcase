This game is really the most fun i've had with combat anywhere! sure, the story can get confusing at times but all in all, it's an epic, challenging and beautiful game. Not very original though and a bit limiting when it comes to pathing. If i want to jump off a hill, i should be able to! or go down the stairs the way i want it etc. As mentioned, the combat is awesome and as a soundtrack lover, i also loved the music. I'd give the game a solid 7 out 10.
