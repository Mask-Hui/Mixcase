I was wary about this game at first, I didn't really look into it too much before I bought it, but on a recommendation, I did. I started playing it for a short time, and enjoyed it. What really made me realize that I liked the game was when I looked at my clock. I thought I had spent, maybe a half hour playing, when in reality, I had spent 3 hours. When a game can capture your attention like that, then for me, it is doing something successful.
