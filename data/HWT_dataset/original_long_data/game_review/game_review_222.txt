I was wary about this game at first, i didn't really look into it too much before i bought it, but on a recommendation, i did. I started playing it for a short time, and enjoyed it. What really made me realize that i liked the game was when i looked at my clock. I thought i had spent, maybe a half hour playing, when in reality, i had spent 3 hours. When a game can capture your attention like that, then for me, it is doing something successful.
