Skilltree saga is a bad concept well executed. Some game designer evidently concluded that gamers love managing their equipment and progressing up a skill tree so much that the sensible thing to do would be to offer a game that strips away all the other elements of an rpg, and makes the player responsible for inventory and skill-progression management of a character who is otherwise a complete automaton, progressing from one randomly selected monster to the next, and battling them entirely without your input. It's boring and tedious. On the plus side, the graphics are pretty and the background music is pleasant, although the sound of 'your' character and the monsters he fights endlessly making the same repetitive grunts at each other gets aggravating quickly. The english translation is rather weak, too. Bottom line, skilltree saga removes too much autonomy from the player, resulting in a pseudo-rpg that's a very small step removed from being a clicker game. If that's the experience you're seeking, you're probably better off just playing a clicker in the first place.
