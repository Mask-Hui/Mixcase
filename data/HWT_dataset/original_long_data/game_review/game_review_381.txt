It may be old, but its still great, I heard about the game a while ago but never bought it, now that Ive recently started playing it i wish i would have bought it when it came out, I was in a between-game funk, it seemed like i wasnt satisfyed with alot of the games i was buying and had already bought, but this game fixed it, i herd there was a 4th coming out and i am definitly getting it.
