I try not to read reviews before i try the game. Everyone has their own opinion. I enjoyed the game to teach management and coordination skills, but the ai is just to buggy. When a tunnel is stuck on the nose of a plane and won't retract, so the plane can't depart, you are basically finished.....also had three vehicles get stuck at an intersection. Fix the issues so its playable, and put in a fast forward button so your not sitting around waiting for 20 minutes to pass. Thks
