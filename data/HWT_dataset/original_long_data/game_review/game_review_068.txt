I started to play rise of the tomb raider as a big fan of the series and i must say i am not disappointed! first of all with the quality, very smooth, no lags at all, the lights, the colors and the gameplay. Everything works very well at full graphics. I am amazed by the rendering of the faces, the eyes, skin, mouth and teeth makes everything very realistic and captivating. The hair is still weird but i haven't seen any game yet capable of rendering hair well, i guess it's a real challenge to do. It doesn't bother me so much though, the overall quality is amazing. From the tomb raider point of view, lara doesn't look like lara so much...at the moment in the game. She looks very young and have a very soft and nice face while she's supposed to be like 'eh, get off my way i have tombs to raid'. She always had that sense of humour very lara-like and that specific attitude. She appears way too nice right now. Maybe it will change during the game? i don't know. I miss her enormous boobs and hips too, it was...very lara-like! for the gameplay, i really like it, it's smooth and intuitive. I like the survival part but i hope there will be more puzzles and tricky ways to go later one. We all love puzzles and challenges in tomb raider games. There's a big part of survival, looking for equipments, or materials to craft upgrades. It's interesting but i hope the puzzle part hasn't been neglected. I will tell at the end of the game. I have very satisfied at the moment, i do not regret buying it! no lags, no bugs, nothing wrong about the running of the game at the moment. All happiness to play!
