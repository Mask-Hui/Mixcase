i try not to read reviews before i try the game. everyone has their own opinion. i enjoyed the game to teach management and coordination skills, but the AI is just to buggy. when a tunnel is stuck on the nose of a plane and won't retract, so the plane can't depart, you are basically finished.....also had three vehicles get stuck at an intersection. fix the issues so its playable, and put in a fast forward button so your not sitting around waiting for 20 minutes to pass. thks
