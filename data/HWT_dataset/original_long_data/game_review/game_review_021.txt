Normally I am always the person to convince people to buy Total War games as most of my friends on steam know.  But Now it is not the case. I loved this game when it came out. It was way much better than TW:R2. But now it's not the case. CA's DLC strategy is just outrageous. Back in Napoleon: TW and TW:S2, those dlcs are actually good stuff. Here every single DLC is ridiculously similar as another. They are using the TW:R2 ♥♥♥♥ again. They relased 4 dlcs in the very month of release. lol I haven't seen anything like this before.
