Normally i am always the person to convince people to buy total war games as most of my friends on steam know. But now it is not the case. I loved this game when it came out. It was way much better than tw:r2. But now it's not the case. Ca's dlc strategy is just outrageous. Back in napoleon: tw and tw:s2, those dlcs are actually good stuff. Here every single dlc is ridiculously similar as another. They are using the tw:r2 ♥♥♥♥ again. They relased 4 dlcs in the very month of release. Lol i haven't seen anything like this before.
