Welcome to Mr Pumpkin a stylish point and click adventure game. Where clicking every inch of the screen will be the norm and clues to odd puzzles are hind behind a boring hint mini game. Sounds like fun!?... Me neither which is strange as point and click games are normally right up my street. Pro tip: Add outlines to objects you can interact with and update or remove that boring hint game, its not fun or challenging.    Really wanted to like this title :S
