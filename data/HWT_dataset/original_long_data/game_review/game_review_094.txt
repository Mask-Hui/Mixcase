I am normally a fan of more abstract games, walking simulators and the like. I usually think of myself as a pretty intuitive person as well. Despite this, I didn't like Rememoried. I played through 2 or 3 levels and it felt more like I was playing a tech demonstration than a game. I didn't understand my character hitbox and how I was going to interact with the geometry in the game. I found it difficult to -jump- on things.   Maybe it was the first person view that tripped me up, but even without that, I didn't feel like I had any idea why I was doing things or going places. I felt punished by 'failure' which sometimes was just because I was testing the edge of the level, which then would restart, all voice acting included.   I was excited about this game, but after getting stuck not being able to jump to a platform and having everything else set me back a level, I couldn't keep going.
