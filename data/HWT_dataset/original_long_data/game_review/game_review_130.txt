So, i used spriter pro for a month. Do not buy or use it for any project. You will not finish them. In characters maps 1. 'merge active to new' button - merge all your maps in both active and avaiable window. So it is useless 2. Save maps button don't work in 90% percent of cases. So it is useless 3. Load button never works, you choose file and then nothing. So it is useless 4. When your project is bigger then spriters examples 'creat new cm' will hit you really hard, it is awful. 5. And the most terrible thing - bug of centers of sprites, sometimes they displaced and you can't fix them. In any menu. Z-order: 1. When you are using operations like 'paste to all keys' - all z-orders mix up in all animation.(fixed) import animation in current scene(animation ) 1. Dev says it is experimental. Actually it does not work at all. You can inmport, but after that work with this animaton is over for you. (fixed) in last update devs add option to move animation between entitys. 1. When you use it, your programm will crush in 5 min 2. You can't save project. It is awful and usefull, don't repeat my mistakes, and don't buy it.
