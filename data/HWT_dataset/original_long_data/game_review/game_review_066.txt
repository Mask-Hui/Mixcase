War Thunder, a game where a round that penetrates 400mm of armor bouces off of 50 mm of slightly angled armor. a game where many 20mm incendiary cannon rounds can hit a fuel tank and the pilot and not kill him or catch him on fire, but his 7.7mm tracer round can one shot your plane. especially tail gunners. 10/10 would play with people that cant play on server from their own country again.
