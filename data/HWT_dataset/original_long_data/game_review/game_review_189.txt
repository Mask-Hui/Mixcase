Fallout 3 story was better. Settlements get in the way of the story to the point you'll hate baby sitting them instead of playing the story. Some keys are hard coded and cannot be rebound. Bugs galore. My Pipboy disappeared permanently at one point and had to research console commands to get it back. You don't have to work for Power Armor it's basically given to you from the beginning of the game and power cores are everywhere in trader shops. Value of power armor diminished greatly from previous Fallout games. Story is medicore, everything about this game is mediocre except it doesn't crash every 10 mins like Fallout 3. Very stable compared to Fallout 3. Is it better than Fallout 3 NO. Is it better than New Vegas? NO. This title was so overhyped for how bad it actually is. It's almost boring and unenjoyable how much time you have to waste doing menial tasks that have no meaning to the game. They threw in tons of features and extras and skipped right over making this a satisfying story mode experience. Falls short of being a good Fallout game. Could have been pretty good if they had a better game plan for delivering a satisfying story. I've spent about 120 hours in the Commonwealth and most of it was boring, repeattive, monotonous, tedious, and at times frustrating to play due to multiple bugs. Gonna have to give this a thumbs down, I cannot recommend this game to my friends as being a satisfying expeirence, it's a huge unsatisfying waste of time.
