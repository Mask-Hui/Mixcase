Not that bad...  Altough getting used to the controles may take some time, RBI Basevall 2016 is a fun and fast arcade style Baseball game.  Graphics may not be as good as you might suspect from a 2016 game, but the lack of animation and the cardboard audience keeps the pace of the game high. (No loading screens).  Overall a fast quick pace baseball game...
