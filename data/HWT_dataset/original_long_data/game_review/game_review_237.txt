Not that bad... Altough getting used to the controles may take some time, rbi basevall 2016 is a fun and fast arcade style baseball game. Graphics may not be as good as you might suspect from a 2016 game, but the lack of animation and the cardboard audience keeps the pace of the game high. (no loading screens). Overall a fast quick pace baseball game...
