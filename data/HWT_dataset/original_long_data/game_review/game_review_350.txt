This game was far to /simple/ to be worth $7.99. It was way to easy and play time was less than two hours. I'd already read other reviews on this game and quite frankly the /ONLY/ reason i even purchased it was because it was on sale for $0.79. In my opinion the price of GOMO should be changed to less than a dollar year round. Unless or until the price is changed my recommendation is - dont buy unless on sale.
