It's not a secret that Tt write good stories. But that isn't an exuse to release a broken game. If a 30 FPS lock would be appropriate anywhere, it would be in their games. With a computer that can handle these games with no problem, it annoys me that the audio still ♥♥♥♥s up after only 2 minutes of gameplay. It keeps shuttering, lagging and dropping out altogether.  I warn you, don't buy any TellTale game until they have listened to their angry costumers, and fixed their faults. And if you absolutely have to buy one, buy The Walking Dead: Season 1.  I have now made a promise to myself to never again buy a TellTale game.
