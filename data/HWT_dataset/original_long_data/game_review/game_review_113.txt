I installed it to see how bad it was, it is pretty bad. Do not waste your time on this.   Summary: -Spend time walking around the moon while the game throws meteors at you, which you somehow manage to survive although your screen is bleeding.  -While walking around you have a really annoying shaky camera, which caused a stomach ache for me. -'Grab the Mars DLC' on the select planet screen. -I found the objective but there was no means of interacting with it, so I quit. Else I had to run about 2-3 miles which takes about 20-25minutes. Not worth the time.
