I installed it to see how bad it was, it is pretty bad. Do not waste your time on this. Summary: -spend time walking around the moon while the game throws meteors at you, which you somehow manage to survive although your screen is bleeding. -while walking around you have a really annoying shaky camera, which caused a stomach ache for me. -'grab the mars dlc' on the select planet screen. -i found the objective but there was no means of interacting with it, so i quit. Else i had to run about 2-3 miles which takes about 20-25minutes. Not worth the time.
