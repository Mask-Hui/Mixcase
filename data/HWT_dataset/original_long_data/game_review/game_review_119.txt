Stands the test of time. Fallout new vegas and fallout iv have both come out since, but this one still has a compelling story and fun enough gameplay to make it worth a pickup - and you can probably get it at a very low price. Be sure to head over to nexus mods. There's a learning curve if you've never modded a game before, but its well worth it. Its like playing your favorite game again - for the first time.
