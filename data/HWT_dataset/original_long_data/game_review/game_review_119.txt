It puts the ball in the net or it gets the hose again.  Absolutely amazing, have nothing negative to say about this game as it's exceeded my expectations and will probably exeed yours too. Fluid movement, bug/crash free, lots of story/content to put you through, options for each and every day such as multiple practices, events (sponsorships) and even games. This review is purely based on playing MyCareer, and so far it's 10/10.  Facescan worked really well for me (used it two times, first one made me have a downsyndrome forehead though..). Keep in mind, using the MyNBA2K17 app will allow for you to facescan for free and allow you to earn daily VC. #sellout
