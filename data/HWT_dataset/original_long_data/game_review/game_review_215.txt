Pros:  +Graphic  Cons:  -Bugs(especially the environment, you may get stuck or your shots may hit a invisible wall despite having clear line of sight of the enemy)  -game is handholding/ babysitting you  -dumb AI -enemies always seem to know where you are when you are spotted -godlike accuracy by the enemy which is frustrating like the first ghost warrior. -terrible checkpoints and saves. -boring story that i couldn't care less about  Will not recommend it unless its 90% off Even then i find playing this game to be an extremely boring chore, just playing for the sake of finishing it to move unto the next game in my library. Considering the time i wasted on the first ghost warrior (which was equally boring and i feel liberated when i finished it), i probably won't play it until the end.
