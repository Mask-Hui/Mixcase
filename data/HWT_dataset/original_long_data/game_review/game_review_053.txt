Just like many other games: you're working to getting newer, bigger, better, more things. In this case, you're doing in the guise of an american truck driver trying to make a living. I've seen a few driving and racing games. This is one game where you almost need/must get a good steering wheel controller for the longer trips. I upgraded to a t150 wheel and it makes a major difference in control, feel, and total effect. The the truckersmp third party multiplayer mod adds so much to it. Unfortunately, in mp, the only other vehicles are the other players. No npc vehiicles at all. It's an interesting concept of building your empire from the trucker standpoint. This unique standpoint is definitely addicting for strange reason.
