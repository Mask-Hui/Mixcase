Unfortunately this game is linear and uncreative. A promising game held back with poor execution including bad voice acting, lame writing and boring gameplay. In order to solve the way to kill someone it'll take you a matter of minutes because there are only a few areas to even access. No multiple ways to kill someone either. Got it for $2 and i feel like i over payed.
