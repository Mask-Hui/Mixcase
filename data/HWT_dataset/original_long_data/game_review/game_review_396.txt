I was really into this game when I first got it, as it has the least pay to win i've seen in a free MMORPG, and sure the quests can get stale, but most of the quests are more for optional grinding purposes anyways. The classes and such are fun to use, and you really feel like you're accomplishing something when you level up and get new skills. Keep in mind when playing that this game is a casual MMO, so don't go into it with a very competetive mindset or you'll get kinda blown out, it's a nice game to pass the time, and record your online progress.
