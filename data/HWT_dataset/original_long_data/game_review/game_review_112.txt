Don't let the hours on my Steam version of the game fool you - I sunk way, way too much time into the free download version of this game. Thankfully, you can sync your Steam and original versions of the game to avoid needing to unlock everything again, because this game has an incredible amount of unlockables.  If you want to play a turn-based roguelike with an absurd amount of depth, this is the game for you.
