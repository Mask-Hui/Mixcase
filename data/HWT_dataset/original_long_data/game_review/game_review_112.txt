This shooter is a free to play gem, the shooting feels great and the map and class designs are awesome. Kinda like Counterstrike and TF2 had a baby. The map selection could be bigger but this got better once I realised I could wall jump and learn various trick jumps hidden throughout the maps. It has an addicting feeling of easy to pick up hard to master as all the classes have optimal ways to be played, with little tricks you learn for each map that are gained through experience and skill growth.  Havent found any issues with it being pay to win so far. Characters (classes) are on a free to play rotation,  character loadout cards  which determine perks and weapons are obtained through cases. These come in different rarities, with the rarest cards  only making cosmetic changes to your character , the number of perks on the cards are capped at 3, and these are avaliable on the low-mid tier cards.  I had already obtained 2 of these max perk cards and one higher tier cosmetic card by about 10 hours gameplay thanks to the trade up system that recycles unused cards.  Overall very solid game if your looking for a new free to play game or just a decent fps game I wouldn't pass this one up.
