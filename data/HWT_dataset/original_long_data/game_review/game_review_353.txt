I dont know what they did but the entire game feels better. The driving handling: this was my nr.1. Concern on carmageddon reincarnation. Now its more fun, i feel like i can control the cars more, as however i did not seem to get that this has always been carmageddon driving style anyways.. Which is a little bit slidy. But now it is a great balance between that and having control. Why is this good and important? because it allows for more fast pace action. It doesent frustrate the player by sliding to much out all the time. And it gives the player more enjoyable gameplay. As for myself i actually learned on reincarnation just from experience how to control the cars, but now i think most people wont need over 10 hours time just to learn how to use the cars. I really liked reincarnation and this is a very nice refinement of that game. Recieved it for free since i bought reincarnation so im not complaining at all. The new 'reincarnation' -&gt; max damage is a more fun carmageddon game. I recommend people buying this one and not reincarnation. The improvements ive noticed so far: -better fps optimization (on reincarnation you would actually need a kickass rig to play smoothly) -better vehicle handling (ive tried eagle type r and max kutter) -more peds and variation -more new maps -feels like ai is a little bit more improved (might be some more stuff i havent noticed) anyways its like going from gta iv to gta v on the smoothness, which is a big plus. Because now we can enjoy carmageddon like its supposed to be played. I enjoyed reincarnation aswell but this one fixes up everything and so far it has been very good. I recommend this carmageddon game and thanks to the company, for giving us who bought reincarnation, a free copy of this so we can enjoy this new refined and refreshed edition.
