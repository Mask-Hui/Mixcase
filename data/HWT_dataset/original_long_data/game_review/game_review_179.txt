I have only seen two bad reviews that were written by somebody that had more than two hours on the game, and neither of those people have as many hours as i do. I can safely say that this game is awesome. -&gt;cons: -relies on rng -pretty much risk. -&gt;pros: -great for short, fast paced games. -requires strategy and thinking ahead -reguires smart use of money and land placement
