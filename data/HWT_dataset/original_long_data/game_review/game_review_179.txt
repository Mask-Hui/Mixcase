I have only seen two bad reviews that were written by somebody that had more than two hours on the game, and neither of those people have as many hours as I do. I can safely say that this game is AWESOME.  -&gt;Cons: -Relies on RNG -Pretty much Risk.  -&gt;Pros: -Great for short, fast paced games. -Requires strategy and thinking ahead -Reguires smart use of money and land placement
