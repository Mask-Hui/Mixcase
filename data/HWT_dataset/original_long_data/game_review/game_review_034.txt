After playing borderlands 2 I can safely say that this game was very underwheming to say the least, especially compared to Borderlands 2, or even the orginal Borderlands. With about 2 super huge, game changing bugs still not being fixed, and still a bunch of rare loot not assigned to be dropped by anything. Plus, there are a ton a enemies that drop rare loot that you can only encounter ONCE. ONCE. Which means you will either have to alter your save file, or start a new charater. I feel this makes it harder for people who like farm this loot to get what they want without going to the grinder, or a save editor. Its not a total trash game though, I've had my fun with it, and still do. But your looking for a TRUE Borderlands experience, or are new to the series. Get Borderlands 2.
