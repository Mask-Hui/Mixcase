'To The Moon' is no mere game... nay, it is a veritable experience, and it was one of the best of my life at that. Think Telltale's The Walking Dead is sad? Hohoho! Well, it's no match for To The Moon! Never before have I been so depressed yet fulfilled over something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky and the gameplay is not the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that I did not care one bit. Plus, the humor of the game is great as well and it definitely does not intrude upon the distinguished nature of the story... and the Doctor Who references are endless. :)  If you enjoy story-based games like those of Quantic Dream or Telltale, and/or you are a Doctor Who fan... you know what, no matter WHO YOU ARE, please play this. It is an experience that everyone should have, and by far the most important 'game' I have ever had the privilege to complete.
