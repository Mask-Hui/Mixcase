Many of the criticisms of this game are valid. I, however, have had fun playing the game and I am impressed enough with the tech to continue to support this team and their work. I knew when I put money down that I was supporting, at best, a work in progress for a small development team.   I still dream for a more modern Privateer with fewer compromises and it's exciting to see how close we are getting when for decades the big publishing houses abandoned this genre.
