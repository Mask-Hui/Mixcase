All: the new full registry for testing for expanded testing (interoperability and end-to-end) can be found on the bottom of the page at: http://www.nerc.com/~filez/tag/e-tag/e-tag.htm these files include a snapshot of the full registry taken last friday as well as the test registry previously being used by the vendors for interoperability testing. All production urls have been replaced by test urls from the vendors. There was a slight delay in the issuance of this test registry due a death in paul baratelli's family. Contact lynn costantini if there are any problems. If an individual company wishes to test their own "home grown" software, the test urls should be sent to paul baratelli (paul.baratelli@nerc.net), with copies to lynn costantini (lynn.costantini@nerc.net) and me (bob.cummings@nerc.net). Please note that some of the csv files were updated on 11/12/01 and some on 11/09/01. The newer files contain updates to the test urls made today.
