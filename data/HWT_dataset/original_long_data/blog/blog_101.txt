The author lists several points of advice, these were the points that caught my eye: urllink how to have a good relationship and marriage : 'accept influence. A marriage succeeds to the extent that the husband can accept influence from his wife. If a woman says, 'do you have to work thursday night? my mother is coming that weekend, and i need your help getting ready,' and her husband replies, 'my plans are set, and i'm not changing them,' this a guy is in a shaky marriage. A husband's ability to be persuaded by his wife (rather than vice-versa) is so crucial because, research shows, women are already well practiced at accepting influence from men, and a true partnership only occurs when a husband is able to do so as well. Have high standards. Happy couples have high standards for each other even as newlyweds. The most successful couples are those who, even as newlyweds, refused to accept hurtful behavior from one another. The lower the level of tolerance for bad behavior in the beginning of a relationship, the happier the couple is down the road.'
