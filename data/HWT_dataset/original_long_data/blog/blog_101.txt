Bill Clinton : 'Remember, Lisa: if things don't go your way, keep complaining until your dreams come true.'  Lisa : 'That's a pretty lousy moral.'  Clinton : 'Well, I'm a pretty lousy president.'   Happy day today. Sean got asked to prom. And if Sean doesn't stop referring to himself in the third person, Sean is going to get beat up. Anywho. The wonderful Valerie Berlin asked me, and of course I said yes. I mean, who could decline such a fantabulous person? Soitenly not me.   :-D   Our calculus class is a bunch of savages when it comes to free food...  I also ran a time-trial in the 2-mile because we didn't have a meet. Of course I beat all the JV so I am running both the one and two mile races next Saturday at Klein Collins for our district meet. Huzzah. Come and see me! It's not like you have anything better to do. Unless you do... And this Saturday come and stop by the Louetta parking lot for our track car wash. If you wanna see some hot girls (such as Erin) and hot guys (such as myself...) in bathing suits with sponges and hoses and water and wetness all around, come by! It's free, with hamburgers and stuff to eat (donations readily accepted!).   Well I gotta get ready for drum show. Catch you later.  God bless
