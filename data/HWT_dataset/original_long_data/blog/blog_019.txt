i used to love the way we used to be. back when things were innocent and the simplest answer always solved the problem. people said that growing up was better... so many things to learn, so many dreams to cherish, but they were lying. what they took for maturity was just another term for slow dying. i opened my eyes, and all the visions left them until i'm blind. trusting only to what i feel and that can be severly misleading .sometimes fataly. look at the mistake i made in you-- from past experience, i expected that you would stay true. but here you stand, lying to my face with not a hint of remorse and i'm not sure what to make of it all. i used to love the way you used to be. back when things were simple and we were really free. don't you regret leaving it all behind? don't you wake up in the middle of the night with tears drying on your cheeks left over from the dreams that you will never be able to keep? i want back my naivete.    i want back your love.
