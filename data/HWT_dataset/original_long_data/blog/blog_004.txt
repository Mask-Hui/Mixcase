Did i mention that i love amy lee? i can't stop playing the acoustic version of urllink my immortal . She kind of reminds me of that girl , and the girl right before her, and maybe a couple of others. Actually, i think she reminds me of what i thought i was getting but wasn't with every relationship i've ever had. And she has an absolutely amazing, haunting, compassionate voice. I want to meet her sooo bad. No its not one of those silly crushes. She's the one for me. I can dream i guess.... What's on the soundsystem? evanescence, my immortal i've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone and though you're still with me i've been alone all along
