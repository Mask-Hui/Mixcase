Did I mention that I love Amy Lee? I can't stop playing the acoustic version of  urlLink My Immortal . She kind of reminds me of  that girl , and the girl right before her, and maybe a couple of others. Actually, I think she reminds me of what I thought I was getting but wasn't with every relationship I've ever had. And she has an absolutely amazing, haunting, compassionate voice. I want to meet her sooo bad. No its not one of those silly crushes. She's the one for me. I can dream I guess....   What's on the soundsystem?  Evanescence,  My Immortal   i've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone and though you're still with me i've been alone all along
