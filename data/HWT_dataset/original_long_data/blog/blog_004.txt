If you read this, jason- happy birthday. The other night, jason and i met up for coffee after i got off work, and he said, 'sorry, jackie, but my birthday plans include dan's brother and dan, so we didn't invite you, and...' and then he let it trail off like that. It's funny that it even had to be said. I thought some things were just too obvious to talk about. In a lot of ways, i have assumed, without mentioning it, that i don't even exist to that group anymore- like most of them have buried me, said their last words (both nice and not-so-nice), and have then happily gotten on with it. Anyhow, it did kind of bothered me that he even brought that up, because i wouldn't have thought twice about it otherwise. But once it was spoken, then i had to actually ingest it, think about it. Well, either way.
