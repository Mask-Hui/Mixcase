Here's some poems that i have wrote when i was going through my heart break with aj and ones that i have wrote lately... So alone i never felt this way around you its like i am alone but u are there i liked when u looked in my eyes but now you look elsewhere i loved the old times we had the time u use to spend with me you say you don't have time but i'm not blind i can see your feelings for me have changed but i still like you the same i wish we would be like before remmber when i seen u and u was glad i came r them times gone forever or will we be together again some day i wish you could show me u care and love that's what i always hope and pray but everyday i feel more by myself more and more scared and empty like the only book on a shelf time came and we r different now well maybe not me but i know u r remmber when i first went to your house and when your mom was gone u kissed me in the car now when we are together i feel like no one cares its weird i thought u was everything but now i just look away and stare i think about this way to much i always go to you and blame when i should just go away but being alone makes me go insane now that i am alone and drifting away i want someone to save me but i don't know the right way i just need away from the pain and confusion i want to be loved again this is all i ask for why cant i have that its not like a sin save you i feel like what i wish for wont ever come true all i want is to be loved by you i dream of us being together again someday but i don't really know what to say i can never get over the fun times we had the times when we was good and the times we was bad you are just so confused and lost you don't think about how it will cost i thought u was the one that was supost to save me but me trying to save u is how it came to be but u don't want to be saved and it hurts me to know my beliefs and my true love is what i wanted to show i don't know if you even took any of what i said i wish my words would stick in your head i thought you was the one that i was supost to get maybe it was just a lesson i don't want to omit i will never give up i already promised myself i couldn't but i know that falling in love wont help and i shouldn't i want you to open your eyes and see what i view i just wish i could save you... Something good i know i got something good and its right there for me to take not quite sure if this will be another mistake why do i do this to myself, i shouldn't get upset don't do something you know you are going to regreat i am looking for something i already have, just don't want to find i don't understand myself, i'm so confused in my mind then my dreams start to come true but i don't really know what to do its like what i wanted i am not sure about now i want to fix this but i just don't know how my days are getting shorter but my nights are long but this confustion helps me write a good song i should look for the best in something that's not i will just live, let time go, and give it a shot the right did you ever know u was going wrong but didn't do the right then things happened and you didn't want to be in sight everything you did is now miserable and you dread you want to go back and change what you did and said but its too late now that time is long gone and past you wonder how long this pain and crap will last the only way you get away is in your prayer and dreams hate and being all alone is what it seems don't give up, never do that to yourself look in your mind don't lessen to your mouth hang on somewhere in this world there's something good to find just keep looking don't let problems make u blind if u fall get up don't laydown don't even take a rest lessen when someone comes alone and pokes u in the chest don't give up have some faith, look past the worse i know how it feels like your under a curse but good will come if u look for it don't let it get worse as u sit hang on to your life don't let it go your problems wont grow look for that something in your life that makes u feel right just have faith and hold on tight
