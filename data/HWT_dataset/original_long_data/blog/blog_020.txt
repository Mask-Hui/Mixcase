Today I was walking to 3rd period and someone was listenin' to rap on their CD player.Around that time I decided that rap sucks. I mean, all it is is a bunch of guys talkin bout their problems and complainin. Eminem: No one cares bout' your family life. It's your problem, not ours. If you want to feel better about it I suggest that you go to therapy. R.Kelly: Don't piss on teens. We don't like it.Seek help. Also, Jacko is in jail,right? Pedo's freak me out. Knock Knock. Who's there? Little Boy Blue. Little Boy Blue who? Michael Jackson. What does Michael Jackson like about 28 year-olds? There are 20 of them. He should be given the electric chair. Oh wait, Californya dosen't kill former pop idols. Oh well, just gotta take over the world then. Later
