I decided to put a few pics up from my graduation. That's was an awesome day! Just as a quick note: the only people missing from the group picture are my younger siblings Caleb and Lynne and my older brother Sean. Caleb and Lynne were at my graduation but had to leave the 'after-party' early. Sean wasn't able to get the day off but it was great because he called me that morning to tell me that he loves me and wishes me the best. That made my day even brighter than it already was. I'll put up more pictures of god knows what later on. For now, I think I'll just go to sleep.
