ever heard that expession 'one persons trash is another ones treasure.'? heed those words. dont get bitchy when someone picks up something you threw away. exspecialy since you didn't want it...hmm...maybe i shouldnt be saying that. i wish someone were online right now. cjs idle so thats no help. i wanna talk to somebody. sometimes, i dont know what to think about things. its like im kept in the dark and never know how other people really feel and what their motives really are until im hurt or sad. such a depressing world..seems as if nothing is good and true, or that good things are rare to come by. so how can it be, that when you find something that makes you feel good and really is true, that it could possibly be bad? the world is backwards like that. ew..theres a bug in my room. my lil sister is scared. im not really afraid thought because really, its only a bug and its not gonna bite : ) i wish she would sleep tho. its almost 4 AM and im ussualy up by myself this early/late. hmm...i wonder if theres really a god. never been a strong believer in religion, although i think islam is pretty cool. hehe. but about the god thing..i dunno just seems a little imaginative to me. but, guess its all about faith. used to be a hardcore atheist always trying to convince people that it/(s)he doesnt exist but i dunno, i figure that there has to be something more than coincidence and chance that is making my life miserable. so perhaps there is a god, its complete justice is just questionable. ehh...im goin to hell. (i'll take popcorn) : /
