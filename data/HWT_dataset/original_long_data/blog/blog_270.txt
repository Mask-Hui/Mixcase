Today’s driving lesson is all about the signal light … what’s that you ask?  It’s that little knobby thing by your steering wheel and guess what - it actually does something!  If you pull it up or push it down, it makes a little light flash on your car, letting other driver’s know which way you intend to turn.  Wow!  Isn’t that the most amazing thing you’ve ever heard?  Now, you may be thinking to yourself,  “Why do I need to use my signal light?  I know which way I’m going …”  That is exactly the problem!   YOU  may know which way you are going, but unfortunately, most people  AREN’T  mind readers and have no freaking clue what you are thinking.  For example, you may be thinking about turning right at the intersection, but if you don’t signal the driver across from you most likely has no clue.  The outcome of this tragic mistake could be an accident.  Of course, you could keep this accident from happening by simply pulling up or pushing down on that lovely little knobby thing beside your steering wheel.  Let’s recap: 1) Use your G.D. signal light! 2) Other driver’s ARE NOT mind readers. 3) Use your signal light ALL the time, even when there are no other cars on the road because otherwise you will become lazy and won’t use it. 4) Not using your signal light can cause accidents and you will be to blame. 5)  Use your G.D. signal light!
