not really much to post about this weekend.  i read harry potter for most of it.  finished the book.  it was pretty good, went very quickly...  didn't feel like 850+ pages.  sad it's over...  but yeah, quiet reading due to all the reading.  i did get some cleaning done: cleaned the bathroom and did the dishes (rock!).  went to lake george last night for dinner, which was very nice.  didn't spend too much time in the village though.  it was hella crowded up there, i forgot that the 4th is this coming weekend already.  i wonder if they're having fireworks over the lake this year.  they didn't last year, the townies didn't want to deal with the traffic.  i don't have any plans for the 4th :(  i really like this holiday because i  love  fireworks.  last year i went to the fireworks in clifton park with my family, and i might do that again this year.  i dunno.  beh.  anyway.  what a boring post.  sorry...
