Wretched world it's not always a nice thing to wake up in the morning, turn on the computer and read the news. Particularly when the news is so terrible as it is this morning. They found that missing 11-yr old girl in florida, dead. I guess after elizabeth smart was found alive i have higher hopes. But there was no happy ending this time. Makes me sick that people can do that to other human beings. Top that with the suicide bombing in moscow today killing around 40 people. We hear stuff like this all the time. Israel, afghanistan, iraq. Can't believe how good we have it here in canada.
