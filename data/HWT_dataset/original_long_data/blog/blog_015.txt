Babylon   Friday night Im going nowhere All the lights are changing green to red Turning over tv stations Situations running through my head Well looking back through time You know its clear that Ive been blind Ive been a fool To ever open up my heart To all that jealousy, that bitterness, that ridicule  Saturday Im running wild And all the lights are changing red to green Moving through the crowd Im pushing Chemicals all rushing through my bloodstream Only wish that you were here You know Im seeing it so clear Ive been afraid To tell you how I really feel Admit to some of those bad mistakes Ive made  If you want it Come and get it Crying out loud The love that I was Giving you was Never in doubt Let go your heart Let go your head And feel it now  Babylon, babylon  Sunday all the lights of london Shining , sky is fading red to blue Im kicking through the autumn leaves And wondering where it is you might be going to Turning back for home You know Im feeling so alone I cant believe Climbing on the stair I turn around to see you smiling there In front of me  If you want it Come and get it Crying out loud The love that I was Giving you was Never in doubt And feel it now Let go your heart Let go your head And feel it now Let go your heart Let go your head And feel it now Let go your heart Let go your head And feel it now Let go your heart Let go your head And feel it now  Babylon, babylon, babylon   - David Gray
