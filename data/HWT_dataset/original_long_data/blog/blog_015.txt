I am still sitting here trying to finish work that should not have taken this long to begin with. The codeine is kicking in and i am soooooo sleepy . My bed looks so inviting right now. Just a little longer... I am having so much trouble forming a coherent thought, let alone stringing several together in the form of a thoughtful reflection. Whatever happened to writing a few sentences to convey your thoughts. Now they want pages and pages of introspection and analysis- which i'm sure will never get read anyway. I am starting to get a little anxious... I wonder if i would make a good flight attendant... Celia's idea has me thinking now... If only being a groupie would pay the bills! i guess i really should be typing up something meaningful and thought-provoking for my paper, but it doesn't seem to be working that way. Somebody, anybody- please tell me why i always wait until the last minute... Is it really human nature, or am i the only fool who does things like this?! today, of all the days, i decide to go to the doctor about my cough... God bless medicine, but it is not exactly helping my cause here. Alas, i must endure- only two more days of class, then it's all downhill- hopefully!!! now, i am seriously going to finish these portfolio entries. Personally, i think literacy is overrated!!! ttfn, *annie*
