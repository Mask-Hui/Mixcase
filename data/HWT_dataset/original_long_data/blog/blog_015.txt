I am still sitting here trying to finish work that should NOT have taken this long to begin with.    The codeine is kicking in and I am soooooo  sleepy .  My bed looks so inviting right now.  Just a little longer...    I am having so much trouble forming a coherent thought, let alone stringing several together in the form of a thoughtful reflection.  Whatever happened to writing a few sentences to convey your thoughts.  Now they want pages and pages of introspection and analysis- which I'm sure will never get read anyway.    I am starting to get a little anxious... I wonder if I would make a good flight attendant... Celia's idea has me thinking now... If only being a groupie would pay the bills!  I guess I really should be typing up something meaningful and thought-provoking for my paper, but it doesn't seem to be working that way.    Somebody, ANYBODY- please tell me why I always wait until the last minute... Is it really human nature, or am I the only fool who does things like this?!  Today, of all the days, I decide to go to the doctor about my cough... God bless medicine, but it is not exactly helping my cause here.    Alas, I must endure- only two more days of class, then it's all downhill- HOPEFULLY!!!  Now, I am seriously going to finish these portfolio entries.  Personally, I think literacy is overrated!!!  ttfn,   *annie*
