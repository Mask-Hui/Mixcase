What a week ... My right shoulder has tendonitus. It's right under my shoulder blade. So, when i move my arm too much, mainly with a mouse on a computer .... It kills me. I can't move it much now because i was on a spree updating my website and working on other online things. I can barely get up strength to draw anything. Lack of sleep adds to my pain. I'm not too happy right now, but i'll get better. My mom's surgery went ok. Her eyesight has come back some. She can see fuzzy shapes and make out colors. Other than that she's still blind as all sin. Hopefully she'll fully regain her vision soon. My love life is going better. Stan's getting to be more loving lately. I think he's just too absent minded to be romantic. His mind is always on other things like flash projects, what movie he wants to see next, what video games he wants to rent next, etc. So, he never really thinks about romance ... Hmm. Can't teach an old dog new tricks. I'm stuck with this. There are new cartoons on my website and my tetris game's high score board works properly now. That's some of what i've been busy working with on the site. Luv, chrissy.
