Hands down, definitely my all-time fave movie... No matter how many times i watch it, it never fails to inspire me... To hope ... Keep the faith... Stay firm... Never forget that there's a light in the end of the tunnel... Even when everything seems to just crumble around you, when the world seems to go against you... Hold on hope . ==== &nbsp; hold on hope - guided by voices - &nbsp; every street is dark and folding out mysteriously where lies the chance we take to be always working reaching out for a hand that we can't see everybody's got a hold on hope it's the last thing that's holding me &nbsp; invitation to the last dance then it's time to leave but that's the price we pay when we deceive one another animal mother, she opens up for free everybody's got a hold on hope it's the last thing that's holding me &nbsp; look at the talkbox in mute frustration at the station there hides the cowboy his campfire flickering on the landscape that nothing grows on but time still goes on and through each life of misery everybody's got a hold on hope it's the last thing that's holding me ==== never forget that there's always a friend you could turn to... They might not be at your side at all times but they are always in your heart. *sigh* i really miss the ^angels^... Though i've seen&nbsp;some of them the past week, it still doesn't measure up to the times when we're all together, just chillin'... Hanging out at a friend's place, talking about nothing in particular. Just being with each other. *sigh* i'm&nbsp;preparing for another hectic weekend, most of the&nbsp;time would be for schoolwork... Got tons of it... And i thought management subjects would be easy. =p === could've been somebody but things didn't seem to turn out right... Time to take action.
