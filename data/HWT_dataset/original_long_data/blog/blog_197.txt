hands down, definitely my all-time fave movie... no matter how many times i watch it, it never fails to inspire me...  to hope ... keep the faith... stay firm... never forget that there's a light in the end of the tunnel... even when everything seems to just crumble around you, when the world seems to go against you...  hold on hope .  ====     &nbsp;   Hold On Hope     - Guided by Voices -     &nbsp;  Every street is dark and folding out mysteriously   Where lies the chance we take to be always working   Reaching out for a hand that we can't see   Everybody's got a hold on hope   It's the last thing that's holding me    &nbsp;  Invitation to the last dance then it's time to leave   But that's the price we pay when we deceive one another   Animal mother, she opens up for free   Everybody's got a hold on hope   It's the last thing that's holding me    &nbsp;  Look at the talkbox in mute frustration   At the station there hides the cowboy   His campfire flickering on the landscape   That nothing grows on    But time still goes on and through each life of misery   Everybody's got a hold on hope   It's the last thing that's holding me   ====  never forget that there's always a friend you could turn to... they might not be at your side at all times but they are always in your heart.   *sigh*  i really miss the ^Angels^... though i've seen&nbsp;some of them the past week, it still doesn't measure up to the times when we're all together, just chillin'... hanging out at a friend's place, talking about nothing in particular. just being with each other.  *sigh*   i'm&nbsp;preparing for another hectic weekend, most of the&nbsp;time would be for schoolwork... got tons of it...  and i thought management subjects would be easy. =p   ===   could've been somebody but things didn't seem to turn out right... time to take action.
