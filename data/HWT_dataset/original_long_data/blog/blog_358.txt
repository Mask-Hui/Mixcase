So it is 11:14pm mst, and here i sit in my bedroom fixing the personal computer of the personnel director from my job. Not that i mind doing it, but i wonder sometimes at how often i find myself fixing someone else's computer as a favour. I'm glad to be able to love and minister to people this way, but where is the line drawn where it comes to the point that you are being taken advantage of? the last couple of weeks, i've been staying up late reading and such, so i was looking forward to hitting the sack early, until i realized it would be more prudent to get this computer out of my bedroom and back into its owner's hands. *laugh* no rest for the weary, right? so i found myself watching joe schmo 2 again tonight. I think it is my new favorite show. Just hilarious. Quite crude at points, but still just hilarious. I think my roomates and friends are starting to love it too. We have vowed to stick with it weekly on tuesdays. Canada day approaches on thursday, which means a stat holiday and no work. This affords me the oppurtunity to go out on wednesday night and sleep in the next day. I promised jenny and her roomate that we could go out dancing at a club, cause neither of them have ever been clubbing before. I'm quite looking forward to it, and really can't wait to be dancing again. Hopefully it won't end up costing me too much. Anyways, back to work then on to bed. Oh to dream.......... Shalom.
