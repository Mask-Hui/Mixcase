Kerry makes a gesture displaying the size of his vision for America.  John Kerry is running a whole campaign without an original idea.  He has laid out his platform which basically says: 'Anyone, but Bush;'  'I'll do everything better;'  'If I was President everything would be better.'  Did I miss something?  If it was a one man race John Kerry would have no platform...no one to help him define himself...no one to verbally one up...no one to be criticize for being courageous...  John Kerry is crippled by his need to be accepted by everyone.  This race comes down to a man who has no vision and no spine vs. a President who chooses to do what is right even if it costs him politically.  I choose the guy with a spine and a moral compass.
