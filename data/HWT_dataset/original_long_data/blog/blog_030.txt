urlLink    F ollowing the advice of Mike I have stepped out of the constrained world of shoes and socks and stepped into the new liberated world of Flip-Flops. I've always been a summer sandal wearer, but the old Jesus kickers were always a bit heavy and being made out of leather didn't breathe well in the summer heat.  The top pair is an American Eagle 100% cotton flip flop and retails for $19.50.&nbsp;  &quot;This flip flop has a rubber bottom with heavy-duty traction and a corduroy footbed that's padded for comfort. The corduroy upper features a suede detail for extra style.&quot ;  The bottom pair are an Old Navy $3.50 4th of July flip flop. &quot;Patriotic right down to your toes? These flip-flops are for you! Left foot bed features stars and right foot bed features stripes and Old Navy logo. Raised logo decorates rubbery thong. Sole measures 1/2 inch thick, with textured bottom for traction.&quot;
