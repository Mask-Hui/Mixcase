Her school started and i had taken measures to avoid her.. It occurs to me that her happiness is different from mine.. Her happiness is to be with her boyfriend, no matter how bad he treats her because he is her first boyfriend and she wants the relationship to last.. Thats different from my happiness, because my happiness to that she is to leave her boyfriend and be with me.     Although waiting seems to be suffering for her, her hopes kept her happy. In some ways, she is more blessed than me, coz' she has something to look forward to, while i have none. I can't wait because she won't turn to me. I have to go but it could be too much for me to bear. Either forward or out of the situation breaks my heart.     I am.. stuck in a  situation where all i could do is to quiet my heart and think calmly. I could only use work to bury myself as deeply as possible.. I could only think of her from far. And, i could only hear of her voice in my memories. Anything else, i can't and i shouldn't do.     Her school started, she has her friends whom she could rely upon, her work where she could bury, and her studies where her future is concern.. All i could, is to do my best to keep my distance away from her..     Painful, but there is nothing i can do to alleviate myself of the pain.. falling sick but it does not make me feel better..     1 person suffer, is better than 2 people suffer..
