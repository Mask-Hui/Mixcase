I'm uncomfortable. Investigative reporting seems very wrong to me. Or let me rephrase that, the article i'm doing and it's consequences is not exactly something i'm comfortable with. Perhaps it is because i don't believe in it enough, that i cannot really get the complete feel for it. The angst behind it. The full-out passion towards it to question. I've grown up in a country where you don't ask questions. Really, you just don't. They shoot you for that shit. They put you in jail with all these internal security acts. I am not used to this freedom of speech...not used to questioning out loud. Sure, i am not the easiest person to get along with. Sure, i am loud, bitchy and have an opinion with just about anything but to write it down? to put it out? to give it to an audience? do i want to. Oh wait, can i not? no. And that's a hell no for you. I talked to my teacher about it. But he's seems very set on having me do the story. The big drama hoo-ha piece. And i want to say thanks but no thanks. But it's a class. And i need the credit. And it's part of the finals. It just seems so 'wrong'. Like swinging a carrot in front of the donkey to lead it to the slaughter house. Gah. ...journalism bing bang kiss my ass. Harrumpphh.
