i'm uncomfortable.   investigative reporting seems very wrong to me. or let me rephrase that, the article i'm doing and it's consequences is not exactly something i'm comfortable with. perhaps it is because i don't believe in it enough, that i cannot really get the complete feel for it. the angst behind it. the full-out passion towards it to question.  i've grown up in a country where you don't ask questions. really, you just don't.  they shoot you for that shit.  they put you in jail with all these internal security acts.  i am not used to this freedom of speech...not used to questioning out loud.  sure, i am not the easiest person to get along with. sure, i am loud, bitchy and have an opinion with just about anything but to write it down? to put it out? to give it to an audience?  do i want to.  oh wait, can i not?  no.  and that's a hell no for you.  i talked to my teacher about it. but he's seems very set on having me do the story. the big drama hoo-ha piece. and i want to say thanks but no thanks.  but it's a class.  and i need the credit.  and it's part of the finals.  it just seems so 'wrong'.  like swinging a carrot in front of the donkey to lead it to the slaughter house.  gah.  ...journalism bing bang kiss my ass.  harrumpphh.
