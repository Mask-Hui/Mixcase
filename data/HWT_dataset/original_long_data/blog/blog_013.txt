Pears and peanut butter attempt #2. I have hard pears this time, and my own jar of peanut butter which i can dip the pears into, but it is still crunchy peanut butter not smooth and i definitely think it makes a difference. I am also slightly perturbed as i thought this was a healthy snack and have just noticed that per 5th of a jar (and our jars are way smaller) as in per 100g there are 614 calories!!!!!!!!!! don't think about it. Have just got back from an evening out at my old music teacher/friend's house. Yes i know... I missed er for that- but i did tape it! have also discovered that they are showing repeats of series 9 every morning at 9:55! was good seeing my friend, strange but good. I guess i just realise when i see her how much i have changed. I am so much more independant and assertive with her now. Which is good i guess. I showed her my canada photos and she thought they were good. Glad my blog is providing an ideal place for a discussion about tim hortons/timmys/timmy ho's or whatever you want to call it. Haven't used my mug yet today. Tut tut. Well this is my last night at home. Am back to the big city (birmingham) tomorrow. I seem to have so much stuff to take back, it seems to increase everytime i go or come. So long guys mexx
