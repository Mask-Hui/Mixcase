Stressed. Yes i suppose you could say mostof us are stressed. Now yes i have finished my exams however i have just spent the morning at school getting all my textiles and art work up and now i am incredibly stressed because it all looks incredibly shite. And half of my textile pieces keep falling down. Arrrrrgh. And my art work just looks awful and gah gah gah gah. I now have to go to work and next week i am helping the drama depo out with some costume stuff for the play so that will be nice and cool and it means i'll get to see paul a bit more. Good luck with any exams people have today.
