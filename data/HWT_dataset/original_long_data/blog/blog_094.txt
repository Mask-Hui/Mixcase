Stressed. Yes I suppose you could say mostof us are stressed. Now yes I have finished my exams however I have just spent the morning at school getting all my textiles and art work up and now I am incredibly stressed because it all looks incredibly SHITE. And half of my textile pieces keep falling down. Arrrrrgh. And my art work just looks awful and gah gah gah gah. I now have to go to work and next week I am helping the drama depo out with some costume stuff for the play so that will be nice and cool and it means I'll get to see Paul a bit more.  Good luck with any exams people have today.
