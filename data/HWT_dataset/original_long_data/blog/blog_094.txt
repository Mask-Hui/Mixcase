Well it's another day and another morning, one i hope will become more than it is. Right now i am just going to write down a few things on my mind. My g/f is at camp and i hope that she is having a great time wonder what she is up to but then again sometimes i feel like i dont want to know. I looked up the 173rd falcon brigade yesterday they seem to be pretty neat, for those who dont know they are an airborne unit in the united states army, although airborne is not really my thing. I can not wait until i graduate highschool, there are some many things i am going to do. I am definately going to college and while i am in college i will be associated with rotc hopefully passing it all with honours and then into the army. Where i hope aop places me into mechanized infantry so i can work with hummers. I am going to a civil war reenactment this weekend, this should be neat, always fun to watch. Well i am off to find some chow. Have a good day.
