This is a new book out written by suzanne anker and dorothy nelkin (published in december 2003) that was reviewed in the latest issue of urllink leonardo (vol.12, number 8, august 2004) . Unfortunately the reviewer said that it was 'strikingly uneven', laden with 'misinformation and confusion' though handsomely laid out. Could the reviewer be giving an unfair review due to the fact that his work was also in the book? some of the major errors are that there's an extra dwarf in velazquez's *las meninas* and awareness of evolution is ascribed to daumier. Okay, but why does this review leave out christa sommerer, laurent mignonneau or karl sims? urllink
