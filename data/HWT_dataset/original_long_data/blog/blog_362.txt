Hangovers are so damn annoying.  Actually, it's the contributing factor of very little sleep that always tends to come w/ lots of alcohol that's so annoying.  Last night I visited a wonderful mexican restaurant here in town, the reason, Margaritas.  Last fall, it was tradition...every Sunday myself and a friend would be on the deck, chilling under the umbrellas, working on our 2nd pitcher of margaritas.  That tradition has died, but we get nostalgic every now and then.  Last night was one of those times.  Of course, after we finish up the margaritas, she leaves to go see her boyfriend and I'm left w/ nothing to do for 2 hours (till the boy goes to work & she plans on hanging out w/ me again).  So after exhausting all the contacts in my phone (no body loves me, everybody hates me, guess I'll go eat some worms...bastards), I head home with the full intent of just drinking till she calls.    Then comes a call from my future roommate...we're just hanging, we can come over and keep you company!  Woo Hoo!  Now the 'we' consisted of my future roomie and an old ex of mine.  Whatever fucked up stuff we went thru during/directly after the relationship was years ago and we've been very polite when we run into each other, so I figure it'll be fine.  My future roomie ditched us pretty quickly and the ex & I hung out till his current girlfriend got off work and joined us.  I ended up hanging out w/ the both of them till 3 in the morning, just drinking and having a ball.  They are so totally cute together, they match one another perfectly and they're one of the disgustingly cute couples that I tend to make faces at when I walk past.  I'm really happy for him.  And the best part...she actually liked me!  None of this, him disappearing cause she doesn't like me shit.  So now I have 2 more people to party with...yippee.  And can I say one more time, they were so totally cute!
