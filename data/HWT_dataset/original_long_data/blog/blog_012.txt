Do you ever have one of those moments when you begin to reflect on life? like you're sitting in math class bored out of your skull, and you wonder what exactly goes on in your brain that makes you understand math? and you realize that you exist and you are in math class and you wonder why. Then you realize how amazing existing is. And suddenly it hits you-the fact that you are going off on this random train of thought is incredibly pathetic. Ever had that happen? i hate that. You know what else i hate? block schedules. Who would ever come up with that idea? anyone can see that sitting through a two and a half hour class in any subject is cruel and unusual punishment. Oh sure, it's illegal for coldhearted criminals but no one thinks twice when innocent students are subjected to it. Thank you, america. That's the end of the list though. The list of things i hate anyway. Other than that, i'm pretty easygoing. I can feel my head starting to throb. I blame block schedules. And possibly my cold. I hate being sick, and walking around looking like rudolph, and sniffling every two and a half seconds. Ok, i guess the list wasn't quite over, but who doesn't hate colds? i think block schedules help spread colds. Thirty-five kids locked up in a stuffy, overhead room for hours on end? i bet germs love block schedules. They get to eat student for two hours. Maybe we're like germ caviar, like a delicacy. Then again caviar is really disgusting look. Oh well, who knows, germs are weird. I don't think i'll ever understand parents. Even if i ever become one. Why do they ask their kids to 'see things from our point of view' but then they can't be bothered to take one peek from the kid's perspective. The book we read in french, le petit prince (the little prince), talks about how exasperating adults are because everything needs to be explained to them. At the time it was funny but i've realized how true it is. In fact, parents probably invented block schedules. If i ever become an adult, i hope i'm not like that. I'm not too worried though, i'm not really planning on becoming one. I really think its a conscious choice. Like a day comes and you decide its time to take responsibility for things and to be an adult. Now i have no problem taking responsibility, but being an adult entails so much more. So when that day comes, i'll just go and do something childish, like pudding someone's car. (pudding-ing cars is something my friends and i invented.) that'll keep me from getting sucked into this adult thing. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *rleen* ~~~~~~~~~~~~
