See, the weather got cold again and I stopped blogging.   Not really, but I've just kinda forgotten about it.  Today my friend Jen had her baby girl, Megan. She was born at 12:30 in the afternoon and weighs 8 lb. 2 oz. That's a very  happy and exciting thing! It's a second child for Jen and Adam, and a little sister for their almost-3-year-old son, Connor.  Our church has been working through the 40 Days of Purpose, based on the book 'The Purpose Driven Life' by Rick Warren. I've been leading a weekly small group in my house; we met tonight. It was really good. I am seeing a lot of growth in all the people who have been attending - a lot of this was shown in the prayer time, which was a really wonderful time of worship. I've been getting a lot out of it, too. A lot of the stuff I'm 'learning' I was already aware of, but never really 'got'. Now I'm reading it and it's starting to take on real meaning. The trick at this point is getting myself to apply it to my life. But then, there's something I just learned about today - I can't do it myself. I can only change myself if I completely surrender to God and let Him give me the power to change. Much easier said than done - but the rewards are unimaginably marvelous, to say the least.  I'm feeling quite content. Not complacent. Content.
