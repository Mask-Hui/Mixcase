As i sit here waiting for my husband to come home from an 18 hour workday, i am confounded by my reasons to start a blog. Who cares what a 40 year old housewife with two daughters has to say? why do i want to give the world access to my thoughts? what is within in me that makes me want to put my thoughts out there for everyone? i don't know, yet. Hopefully, the longer i post i will learn the answers and i am certain that some will not be very pretty. Although, i do know that one of my hopes for this blog is that someone out there will recognize themselves in this and realize that they are not alone. Things i like: my husband my daughters my pets my house my computer how the outside smells after a rain the seasons sleeping on cold sheets books plants and flowers all types of art perfume animals blue skies with fluffy clouds learning new things cooking recipes from around the world laughing music comedy soap operas off beat television comedies that is not a full list of everything i like, but it is a start. Now things i don't like: impatient people rudeness crime shows sold out concerts long lines no money in my bank account phone calls while in the bathroom people who talk on the phone while using the bathroom dirty bathrooms heat pcos (polycystic ovarian syndrome/disease) prescription meds i have to take everyday pain body images loud talkers gaining weight seeing people vomit that is a start for now. My plans for tomorrow-i have to go to the dmv to renew my driver's license-ugh-long lines, impatient people and rudeness. Friday, a mini-vacation with our extended family. Only one word can describe this-scary. Random observation of the day: when sitting in the doctor's office today, i realized that i could touch and manipulate everything in there and no one would know. Like, i could take all the tongue depressors out of the jar, drop them on the floor and put them back. No one would really notice. I would not do that, but it would be funny to see in a comedy skit.
