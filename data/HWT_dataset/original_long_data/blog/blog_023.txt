As I sit here waiting for my husband to come home from an 18 hour workday, I am confounded by my reasons to start a Blog.      Who cares what a 40 year old housewife with two daughters has to say? Why do I want to give the world access to my thoughts? What is within in me that makes me want to put my thoughts out there for everyone?      I don't know, yet. Hopefully, the longer I post I will learn the answers and I am certain that some will not be very pretty. Although, I do know that one of my hopes for this Blog is that someone out there will recognize themselves in this and realize that they are not alone.        Things I like:        my husband    my daughters    my pets    my house    my computer    how the outside smells after a rain    the seasons    sleeping on cold sheets    books    plants and flowers    all types of art    perfume    animals    blue skies with fluffy clouds    learning new things    cooking    recipes from around the world    laughing     music    comedy    soap operas    off beat television comedies     That is not a full list of everything I like, but it is a start.     Now things I don't like:     impatient people    rudeness    crime shows    sold out concerts    long lines    no money in my bank account    phone calls while in the bathroom    people who talk on the phone while using the bathroom    dirty bathrooms    heat    PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome/disease)    prescription meds I have to take everyday    pain    body images    loud talkers    gaining weight    seeing people vomit      That is a start for now.    My plans for tomorrow-I have to go to the DMV to renew my driver's license-ugh-long lines, impatient people and rudeness.    Friday, a mini-vacation with our extended family. Only one word can describe this-SCARY.    Random observation of the day:    When sitting in the doctor's office today, I realized that I could touch and manipulate everything in there and no one would know. Like, I could take all the tongue depressors out of the jar, drop them on the floor and put them back. No one would really notice. I would not do that, but it would be funny to see in a comedy skit.
