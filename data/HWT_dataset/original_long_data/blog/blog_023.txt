I was sitting in british literature, and i heard all about hypocrites and what they are. Then it strikes to me, isn't everyone hypocrites? i just think that there are so much that people want as success, and all they think that success is wealth, fame, a job that pays a lot, having a lot of friends, or being popular. But that is soo not what success really is. Success is achieving your goals to the highest possibility, and feeling worthy of those goals. I often feel that i am inferior to others, and they often treat me like i don't exist. How do i make myself known? how do i feel better about myself? i have thought so many times over and over, that i want to kill myself, but this is where i am a hypocrite, i am terrified of death. The irony is that i am also terrified of the hand that life will deal to me. What is that makes us stand out from the others? our disability, race, color, religion, looks, what? it just makes me sick that people think that they are better than others, but guess what? nobody is perfect, there is no such thing as 'perfect'. Life is cruel to us often times. I hate life.
