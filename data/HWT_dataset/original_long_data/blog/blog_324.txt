cherrio all  &nbsp;  I made it to merry ole' england in one piece!! we arrived here early sunday morning into Heathrow airport, took a bus into Gloucester and then we took a taxi into Oxford.  &nbsp;  Did you know that Oxford  urlLink http://www.ox.ac.uk/ &nbsp;is really a compilation of 39 small colleges put together. Apparently their is no rhyme nor reason as to how you get into a certain college. Unless of course your parents were fortunate enough to attend one of them you would have preference to that certain college.  &nbsp;  Did you know that a lot of the film Harry Potter was filmed right here at Oxford??&nbsp; I got to go visit the entrance way in which Professor McGonagal meets the students before they enter Hogwarts the first day of school.  urlLink http://www.chch.ox.ac.uk/visitor/index.html &nbsp;I also got to see the Great Hall in which they dined. Although they made a repllica of this hall because the real one only has three long tables and Hogwarts had four schools. One of the libraries here in Oxford also was used as the library and hospital at Hogwarts. I will try to venture over to the New College (which isn't at all new) where the majority of the filming was done. I really wish I had a digital camera right now so I could down load the pics :-(&nbsp; I will however try to update this ASAP upon my arrival back home.  &nbsp;  Did you know that Alice from Alice in Wonderland  urlLink http://www.aliceinoxford.net/ &nbsp;was an actual little girl??&nbsp; The writer of the book actually studied and taught Math here at Oxford, however he spent&nbsp; a lot of his free time telling stories to the young children of the heads of the colleges here.  &nbsp;  Well.. I will be on my way to dinner and will try to update this daily of my journeys!!&nbsp;  tomorrow the museums!  &nbsp;
