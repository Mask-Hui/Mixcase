There's only one more week until my birthday. I didn't really have any way to get back to Wichita so I was just planning on staying here in Manhattan. I wasn't planning on doing anything to celebrate because Darian was going to be gone and there aren't many other people here, but Ann and Jermaine decided to come see me for my birthday! My sister Lindsey also decided to drive up on Sunday to see me! It should be alot of fun.  'Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways aknowledge him, and he will make your paths strait.' -Proverbs 3:5-6
