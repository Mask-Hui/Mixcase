urlLink MSNBC - Statement adds twist to Billy the Kid saga   My apologies for the number of updates lately, especially considering the limited audience I'm sure some of my recent ones have interested, but this is too good to not blog about.   'ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. - Legend has it that Billy the Kid was gunned down by a sheriff in 1881. But was he?   Homer Overton will tell you that the dead man was an unwitting impostor, a drunk shot point-blank in the face by two unlikely chums  the lawman and the legendary gunfighter himself.  Overton learned this some 63 years ago, at age 9, from the widow of the sheriff, Pat Garrett.'  The reason for this article is pretty damn fascinating. Click the link!  Suddenly I feel the urge to watch  Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid  again.
