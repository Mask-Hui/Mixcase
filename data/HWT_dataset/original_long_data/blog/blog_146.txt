The photos (from my birthday) are superb! i can't stop looking at them. Everyone looks so happy.. And sloshed *hehe* the angles of the pictures are great, thanks to ajim and wira. Thanks, guys! damn, i was hugging everyone and just as i suspected, there were a number of me and eye-candy *hehe* the group photo we had one of the waitresses snap turned out extremely well. What can i say.. They're all just perfect!! very excited here. Had dinner at modesto's (telawi) with shak, ajim and denen. Gerald hung out for a few, then he had to split. After dinner, me and denen hit urllink barflam for a bit. Shak and ajim went to pick myrna (shak's cousin), 'cuz she needed to talk to shakhira about something. So, it was me and denen for about an hour or so. Oh, yeah.. He's just too cute!!! *sigh* i'm losin' it, aren't i? i've got it baaaddd! *haha* after barflam, we went to uptown to meet up with fahmy and the guys. Stayed there for a short while and then headed home. Dolly bought me lunch today. Ofcourse i picked chili's.. What else, right? tomorrow's aidiladha, warning sirens are already sounding loud and clear in my head.. Abundance of food and i fear that i might lose a lil bit of self control. Help! help! know what? i'm kinda bored and getting lazy to write more. I'm gonna stop here and maybe blog more later tonight. I want a nap before dinner. O-oh.. I don't know what i'm gonna have tonight. Not really hungry, though.. Maybe i'll skip.. I dunno. I'm out.
