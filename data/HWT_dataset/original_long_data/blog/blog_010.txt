Urllink italian leather handbag&nbsp; urllink my mom just got back from italy today! i'm really excited for her! she had a lot of fun. She bought this really cute pink italian leather shoulderbag (like the one in the picture, except it's not that same brand or color). She also brought me some really cute clothes. I missed her alot, but tomorrow is my last day with her for awhile. Starting sunday i'm house-sitting again. I get done with that on saturday. But then me and deana are going up to ft. Collins and then greeley for yearbook camp. And i'll be gone until july 1. Then sometime in july i'm going to start a nanny job for a really rich couple, and then i'm going to california! i'm so excited!
