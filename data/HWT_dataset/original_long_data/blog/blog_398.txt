Don't go see Troy. No, really. Just don't. If you really want to see Brad Pitt naked, and I assume that's the only real reason that anyone would go to see this movie, just go flip through the new Vanity Fair. As far as Orlando Bloom goes, he looked so faggy in this movie that I didn't even find it attractive, and for me a little fagginess is like a pre-requisite for being my boyfriend. Okay, I admit to sleeping through about 85% of the movie, but I was baked out of my mind after eating weed brownies. What can you do?
