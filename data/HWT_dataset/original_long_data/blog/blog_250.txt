Well I'm still looking for that long lost vintage Atari 2600 game system.  Currently my old one is in about a dozen pieces as my dad and I attempted to perform surgery but failed.  I've scouted out garage sales only to find a sega system with games for $20 - it's just not the same though.  I've been to value village and had no luck there either.  I think the best thing to do is place bids on e-bay.  I've been watching a few auctions and the price seems to be in the $40-$60 range and then $20 shipping.  I think it's worth it.  It would be a whole lot more expensive to go and buy a new videogame system these days.  I just can't wait to play those old games again!
