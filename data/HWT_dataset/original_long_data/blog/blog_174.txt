For most people dealing with boyfriends, girlfriends or just friends of both sexes is hard. Hell I new it was for me. My first crush was someone who I thought was the biggest deal was instead my biggest scare. I was in the 4th grade and I know that your probably think oh that's no big deal but to me, it was the world. I was always scared to tell him how I felt about him but then after 4 years of not talking and just getting eachother's screen names we started talking talking again and I finally told him. Now I know that it seems like a long time but when you finally tell the person how you feel or felt about them it gets a lot off your chest and you feel much better and who knows maybe you are in for a surprise, I know that after I told him how I felt I found out he felt the same way that whole time. So sometimes it is just better to just come out and say things cause you never know what will happen, you are always in for a surprise but you will never get that surprise if you don't step up and take a chance with things. Cause taking a chance is always better then holding back and wondering what would happen if you told that person. Because what you are wondering will happen when you tell that person usually will happen when you tell them and if it doesn't then its obvious that you haven't found the write person yet and that they are still out there waiting for you to come there way even if you are not ready for you to come there way, they are ready for you.
