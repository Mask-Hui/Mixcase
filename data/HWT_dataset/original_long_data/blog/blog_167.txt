Office astrologer: obviously it’s impossible to get the details of everyone who has ever committed murder so instead we took some infamous killers and some people on death row, fed their stats into the work experience, sorry, office computer and the results are on the right. So there you go; sagittarians are most likely to slay. Those born over christmas have initial memories of joy and happiness but they soon subside, which colours all their future life experiences leaving them disillusioned, depressed and ultimately homicidal. Or maybe years of being pissed that their christmas and birthday presents are lumped together mean they go through life with a chip on their shoulder. A “waaaaahh! i want more presents! take some more notice of me” kind of thing.
