Howard Roark, the soul of 'THE FOUNTAIN HEAD', was an Ayn Rand's creation.People yearn for what they aren't.   It is one of the few books I read and re-read again. Words do not always convey the same meaning for everyone who read it, and this attribute makes it very interesting. My perception of this character can be whole lot different from someone else's view.  Roark, precisely, is a super thinker and to-the-core rationalist. Narrated as an athesist, more aptly an intellectual athesist*. He choose architecture to be his reason to live, and he stood by his decision.    And me, anything but what I have said above. Follower of intutions and a believer of destiny. Personality and acumen can be sharpened by constant thinking and be refined by reading good books. In my limited reading experience I have observed a marked difference in the manner I think. Every book takes us one step closer to being better than what we were, but ultimately it falls on our shoulder to drive it in a positive direction.  Athesist; I takes a super thinker and a core rationalist to be an athesist. Athesit whom I came across are not so. They call themselves so just to show they are differnt and don't follow the average crowd. Somehow I can wholly comprehend to what they think, one reason being I was one such dickhead. Sometimes some books influence us so much that we tend to think in the way author wants us, this indicates the author's smartness and the reader's weakness. We are hit by a surge of excellent reasoning and it takes a while to find an answer, and it is between the hit and reasoning people tend to change. Beware of good authors!  -Disciple
