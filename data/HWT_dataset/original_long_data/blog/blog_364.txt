'Dude…we're gettin' the team back together!'   That's all I could think about coming out of the mouth of Lil' Mark as I emailed the Nomads of the impending 7 on 7 outdoor league in Los Alamitos.  Red and I even went shopping to pick up new boots, socks and shorts for him to play in this season.  I felt like his mistress …'Oh no Red, those socks don't go with those shorts - you never mix navy with royal.'   He's stoked to be active and I'm sure he'll fit right in with the rest of the bros.  Of course this means I'll be missing Evening Vespers with the family.  With kick-off times ranging from 7 - 10, I won't be able to make the trek to church and be able to play too.  Oh well, I did leave a stipulation in my contract providing me to be absent on special feast days and Liturgies during the week.  Speaking of praying…So I'm about to do my morning thing at the home altar when I realize that my mom had stayed the night and was conked out on the sofa.  We exchange morning pleasantries and she gives me an update on house buying stategy.  We kiss goodbye and she tells me that she'll be out the door shortly.    Well I spark up the charcoal, light the lampada's and go for it.  Not hearing the door shut anytime soon I realize she's still on the couch.  Well, outside of my family and a few close friends - well…and at church - I'm unaccustomed to having folks lurk as I talk to God.  So I'm feeling pretty shy when I realize that it may be that she is touched at the sight of her son-in-law praying before Christ on behalf of his family, friends, clergy, parish, loved ones departed, the poor and miserable…etc.    A half-hour later, when I'm done she says to me…I think I left my keys and wallet in your car!  Lord, have mercy!
