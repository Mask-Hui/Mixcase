I just booked a hair appointment. A week on saturday i shall no longer be a redhead, i'll be a brunette (with red tendencies). Here's to dismal failure. Interestingly enough, i just got hit on by the hairdresser (this *never* happens). Whilst waiting for my hair consultation, a male who had been staring at me approached me and said, 'can i cut your hair? i want to give you a blunt fringe. Those eyes, i could lose myself in them. You need a blunt fringe to bring out your eyes'. Now, i'm not sure if this was 'the hard sell' or 'can i have your number?' but i assumed a semi-bitchface and said 'i'm here for a colour, actually', so he left it. No point in persevering really, was there?
