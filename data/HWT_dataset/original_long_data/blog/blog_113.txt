I just booked a hair appointment. A week on Saturday I shall no longer be a redhead, I'll be a brunette (with red tendencies). Here's to dismal failure.  Interestingly enough, I just got hit on by the hairdresser (this *never* happens). Whilst waiting for my hair consultation, a male who had been staring at me approached me and said, 'Can I cut your hair? I want to give you a blunt fringe. Those eyes, I could lose myself in them. You need a blunt fringe to bring out your eyes'.  Now, I'm not sure if this was 'the hard sell' or 'can I have your number?' but I assumed a semi-bitchface and said 'I'm here for a colour, actually', so he left it. No point in persevering really, was there?
