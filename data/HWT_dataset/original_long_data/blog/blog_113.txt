I think someone stuck a pin in a doll or something.  My home computer allows me to post comments on only a few of my favorites.  I noticed on  Jerk Store  a mention of  Tim Delaughter , alumni of DHS, Class of '85.  All the girls were in love with him.  I wasn't 'in love' - but I really did want to   bonk him   at least once before he left. What a small world.  It's like what  Jerky Treat  was writing about (another blog it won't let me post comments on, along with  Pisser )...the three degrees of separation of the blogosphere.  It certainly is taking  Dish Boy  a long time to do this install.  I wanted to watch a bit o' telly before I have to haul my happy ass back to work.  The dogs are too quiet.  I don't dare open my bedroom door...  I bet all of you really wish I'd go back to work, doncha?  I've been home for over two hours and the installation is still going on.  Maybe that's why they give you that five-hour window, because that's how long it's going to take.  I bet Dish Boy is wondering when I ever clean up around this place...especially after Nico's deposit in the den.  Waiting on Dish Boy to finish, I decided to read Pisser's archives back before I contaminated the blog world with this crap.  A fight between Pisser and Jerky...I side with Jerky on the dog/cat preference.  However, I am wondering about the biohazard remark.  Certainly other people don't have too much pet hair floating around, do they?  At least with dogs, they shit outside.  Well, except for Nico, who can be in the backyard for 30 minutes but goes right in front of the television to take a dump.  Yea!  It's installed!  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend
