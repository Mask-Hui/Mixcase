Talent  I wonder what is the gene that causes one to create?  I was talking with a couple other parents yesterday, with kids as old as mine and older. Big football game last night, and I noticed how easy it was for these parents to talk about their kids' sporting abilities. When the topic switched to our kids' artistic endevours, both other parents not only were in awe of their artistic child's talent, but both did one of those 'I don't know where they got  that  talent, definately not from ME'. Um, and all that sporting talent you were just talking about, you gave them all that? I believe that everyone of us has creative talent, in different measures and different types. Some of us have a naturally visible creativity, but often some of us don't (can't?) recoginze our own creativity. We need to explore our own talents, encourage each other's, and nurture them so they will grow, not bury them by not acknowledging them.
