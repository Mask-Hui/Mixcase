I have always prided myself in making anyone that frequents casa pescatore as comforable as possible. I want them to make sure they feel at home as they will feel in their prospective residence. Yesterday- i hope i succeeded. The masses all congregated on perry ave with what many consider ' extreme prejudice'. 4:30pm was the time my best friend eric and his son nunu came over with a huge pan of baked ziti. The tables were set and i had all the food that i cooked and the bells were ringing crazy. Before i could blink - my best friend from florida walked through the door and that made me smile. I missed that motherfucker so much. The bonus was him bringing his wife along. She is expecting and this is the closest i could get to being an uncle. I spoiled that girl with tray after tray of food and tiramisu. From oscar to rich - tom and mike - roger, lynne, danny, amalia, herman, john, jessica, abena, diane, ed , seve, and a whole bunch of other people that i forgot. I was pretty happy with the turnout and the food that came through my table. Buffalo chicken wings, sausage bread, cornbread chicken wings, baked ziti, turkey, shrimp, chili, vietnamese spring rolls, pork dumplings, chicken rolls, popeyes chicken, three kinds of rice, corona, heineken, soda and just everything else under the sun. So in keeping on top of everything. I got to see just the last 44 seconds of the game. I had very little interest because i have a deep hatred for both teams so my night consisted of playing host, waiter, gopher. I think the best thing about last night was the diversity of friends. I had the 'poet' folk enjoying everything. I had the 'ghetto' folk actin a fool. I had the 'loud family' thing going on. It was great to have them all under one roof and it was probably the most successful superbowl party to date. Well, off to bigger and better things. Peace
