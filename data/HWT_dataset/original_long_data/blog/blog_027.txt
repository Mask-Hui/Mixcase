same shit, different day.  routine sucks.  i am so A.D.D. right now.  i haven't been productive for the past few months at work.  i'm so distracted and unmovtivated.  i hate that i sit at this desk all day long w no people interaction.  who brainwashed me at school that this would be a great job?  maybe if i was in a different industry.... nah it would be the same.  neverending crap!   graphic artist??   more like production artist!!!  there is no way any of this work can go into my portfolio.  so discouraging... i need a change... a distraction... a reason to continue...
