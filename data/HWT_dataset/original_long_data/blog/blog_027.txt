Today was somewhat anti climatic... just another random day. Tomorrow I have to go and do a whole bunch of stuff...I'm going to vounteer for a Graphic Design position...should be enlightening if nothing else. Right now Dendy Mike is over and him and CB are watching I am Sam, which is a good 2 hours long and all I want to do is play Smash Bros, I'm also chain smoking again. Go figure, didn't I have a good health pep talk with myself the other day? Yeah I know, we all have those...the 'Oh my god I am DISINIGRATING' talks, Har, Har. I like Dendy Mike he is a director and well.. he knows a lot about analysing films. I'm a little nervous about the whole... graphic design thing. What if I fuck up? But I need it so bad, I need to get the hell away from these addictions...you know the ones. I'm not going to repeat it...I guess you could say tomorrow is another day and that life is just a series of choices that you have the power to do. But me and will power we have been arch nemesis since I was a child. I feel like drinking sparklingwhite wine..and relacing in a hot sunny beach under a cool umbrella and salty sea breeze, doesn't that sound lovely? Or how about...sitting by a big comfy chair, reading a good book while snuggling next to a loved one.. hehe... man I've turned so disgustingly cliche! And it sounds like something purple bitch would say... man she is so fucking boring... I have given up reading her washed up live journal. I got a flash book and I should be studying for tomorrow....
