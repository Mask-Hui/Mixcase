Bruna invited me to go to her English Conversation class again and so, Maju and I took the buss from Trindade and went to her school. Hehehe...the bus was one of the acordian-type&nbsp;&nbsp;buses (the ones that bend in the middle), so I was kept amused the whole way . I met Kate there, which was really cool. She's just got to Brasil from the USA two days ago, so everything still new, bright and shiny....heheh, it still is for me too. ;) We were half an hour late getting out of that class, Bruna was worried that Maju was going to kill her. hehehe...  Maju and I grabbed another bus home, and we quickly got changed, went to Mariana's house, then rushed down to Trindade Terminal again. There we met up with Victor, and...Julio?? I think? I couldn't catch his name, and we all took a bus to Lagoa, then hopped on another to take us to Praia Mole. Met up with Lim√£o and Carlos, and three of the guys went surfing, while Carlos stayed on the beach. I've never seen waves like that before, (Carlos said they were like, three or four feet high) and I've never seen sand so fine. It was very beautiful.  Hehe...Carlos spotted a broken surf board in the water and went to get a picture for me or the guy with the two pieces....and I'm going to learn how to do this next week? Yay! ^_^  In the evening Gabby came over. We were talking in my room for like, 2 hours while Maju was on MSN. She decided to go when it was 11:30pm and so I switched with Maju and went on the computer. Spoke to Kate, and Carlos (a half english ,half mutilated portuguese on my part....thankfully Lucas was helping me a little bit.) Lots of fun....I had such an incredible day. I can't wait to learn how to surf either. hehehe....
