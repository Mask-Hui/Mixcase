Yield: 8 servings i found this recipe while at the local used bookstore. It came from the kitchen tested recipes section of an instruction booklet - well, more like brochure or flyer- for a rossini hibachi from 1969. The instruction thinggy wasn't for sell, i think it had fallen out of some other cookbook, but i picked it up and kept it.
