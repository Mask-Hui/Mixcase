For those who don't know, The Assistant is a show where Andy Dick lets 12 people live in his house and choses one of them to be the assistant. Some might think it would be like The Apprentice, but it's not. Andy Dick makes them do weirdo-things (training his cat, finding the lense to his glasses at the bottom of his pool etc.). Andy Dick is hilarious, but the way he choses to send someone packing is really unfair. If you haven't seen it yet, he sends home two people who tried their hardest cooking a meal for Andy, rather than a guy who cheated to get a first-place trophy in a marathon. but besides that the show is hilarious! I luv it this  YYY  much.    &nbsp;      Y KATIE  Y
