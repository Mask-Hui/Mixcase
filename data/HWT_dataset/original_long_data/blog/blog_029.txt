Sorry i haven't been posting much. My summer kicked off with my grandpa dying, so i try to spend time with my grandma. She gave me my grandpa's 1950's fishing lures, and some coins to start off my collection. I decided to start collecting them when i saw the value of them. M.i.a this summer. Wow!! i dont know who to thank. I should start with my parents, then everyone at work, with the exeptation of rad. I haven't worked with him much, but this summer he gives me much less crap for being a sophmore. But the joke is on that ass wipe, he is going to be a sophmore when we are seniors. Yes!!. Any ways, did you ever think i am m.i.a when you never call me and i dont know what you guys are doing. I can do something friday night, while sunday and monday i have off. So call me. I finally got a cd player in my car and i am pretty excited. And i am happpy to know that dustin is a worse halo player than me. I will see you guys later, maybe.
