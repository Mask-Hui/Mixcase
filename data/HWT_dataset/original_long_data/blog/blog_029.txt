Sorry I haven't been posting much.  My summer kicked off with my grandpa dying, so I try to spend time with my grandma.  She gave me my grandpa's 1950's fishing lures, and some coins to start off my collection.  I decided to start collecting them when I saw the value of them.  M.I.A this summer.  WOW!! I dont know who to thank.  I should start with my parents, then everyone at work, with the exeptation of Rad.  I haven't worked with him much, but this summer he gives me much less crap for being a sophmore.  But the joke is on that ass wipe, he is going to be a sophmore when we are seniors.  YES!!.  Any ways, did you ever think I am M.I.A when you never call me and I dont know what you guys are doing.  I can do something Friday night, while sunday and monday I have off.  SO CALL ME.    I finally got a CD player in my car and I am pretty excited.  And I am happpy to know that Dustin is a worse Halo player than me.  I will see you guys later, maybe.
