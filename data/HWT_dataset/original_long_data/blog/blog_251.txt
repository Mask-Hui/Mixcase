One highlight from the urllink interview , which is worth reading in full (and then maybe going and buying the book?): 'the catholic thinkers have a hard time wrapping their heads around the whole question of headship because they keep focusing on the issue of indissolubility: what does it mean to become one flesh in a way that can't be broken? when that's your basic framework it becomes hard to think about headship in a deep way, because if you are really one flesh, can you really talk about your shoulders being subordinate to your stomach, or can you talk about treating your liver the way you would like it to be treated? the principal intellectual distinctions come from that framing.'
