...of really actually doing this. Let's see if this works. It may be a complete disaster. I am a big pussy about trying new things. I would like to be able to think of myself as 'spontaneous' and 'unpredictable', but sadly that's not really the case. I am such an stubborn old lady sometimes, which is bizarre, as i feel like a complete child in relation to the world. Why am i doing this? well, i am at work at the seattle art museum right now. It is very slow. I get to play online when it's slow. Which is a lot. So this is something new to distract myself with. Because that way i won't check my email 500 times every half an hour. Maybe. I am actually surprised how easy this is. Perhaps this is just because i am a more accomplished typist. And i am enjoying this... ...because isn't this every writer's dream? to see their writing in print in public? but i don't want to focus on that aspect. I am doing this because it really is just the act of writing that i am interested in. Okay, but really, yes, i need to break the monotony of my job. Which i love. Because we have some van gogh! which i haven't even been upstairs to see yet. :( but i will! i swear! i promise! but i figure i have three months, so... Let us see how this turns out. Like i said, i am scared and excited. I'm covering my eyes with my hands. I'm not looking, i'm not peeking...
