...Of really actually doing this. Let's see if this works. It may be a complete disaster. I am a big pussy about trying new things. I would like to be able to think of myself as 'spontaneous' and 'unpredictable', but sadly that's not really the case. I am such an stubborn old lady sometimes, which is bizarre, as I feel like a complete child in relation to the world. Why am I doing this? Well, I am at work at the Seattle Art Museum right now. It is very slow. I get to play online when it's slow. Which is a lot. So this is something new to distract myself with. Because that way I won't check my email 500 times every half an hour.   Maybe. I am actually surprised how easy this is. Perhaps this is just because I am a more accomplished typist. And I am enjoying this... ...Because isn't this every writer's dream? To see their writing in print in public? But I don't want to focus on that aspect. I am doing this because it really is just the act of writing that I am interested in. Okay, but really, yes, I need to break the monotony of my job. Which I love. Because we have some Van Gogh! Which I haven't even been upstairs to see yet.  :( But I will! I swear! I promise! But I figure I have three months, so... Let us see how this turns out. Like I said, I am scared and excited. I'm covering my eyes with my hands. I'm not looking, I'm not peeking...
