urlLink Some people  are jumping to connect  urlLink this dot :  The  urlLink Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  was invited to monitor the election by the State Department. The observers will come from the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights. It will be the first time such a team has been present for a U.S. presidential election.  with  urlLink this dot :  A baker's dozen of congressional Democrats, among them four New Yorkers, has petitioned U.N. Secretary- General Kofi Annan to dispatch international observers to Florida to oversee this year's presidential balloting there.  I humbly disagree.  Based on the info available, the OSCE seems to be coming here to   learn from   the U.S. election process, not to   oversee   it, which was the original partisan and childish call for U.N. monitoring from Representative Johnson, who is now scrambling to equate the two for the sake of her own petty publicity.  What exactly is wrong with us saying 'Come and see how the experts do it...' and in the process teaching a thing or two to these countries, some of which are literally building their electoral systems from scratch?  I say bring it on, welcome and pay attention!   Update:   urlLink Outside the Beltway  has a different view -- I'm still having trouble getting riled up about it though.      urlLink
