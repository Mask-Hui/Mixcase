1. Be of the male sex and wear jean shorts. Denim shorts were popular in the 80's, but this is one fad that will never come back. Period. What's even worse is when take tight jeans, cut them off and make them shorts. This should never be done-Ever! It's bad enough that everytime I go to a Braves game all male-jean short wearers come out of the woodwork.  2. Sit on the same side of the table/booth when out with your significant other by yourselves. This is different if you're with another couple. If you are by yourself, please sit across from your loved one. No one wants to see you turned toward the other person the whole time making googly eyes. Sit across from them and you can look at them the whole time.  3. Sit in the middle of a bench seat in a truck while you're boyfriend/husband is driving. There are those couples that can bare to have 2 feet in-between them in a truck. It's annoying.   I'm obviously not speaking for everyone here, but I'm sure a lot of you out there would agree....
