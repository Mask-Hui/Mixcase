urlLink    freesia sleeping *yawns* tired&nbsp; urlLink      i waited for quite awhile for freesia to fall asleep.she looked so cute at the moment.with 1 leg tucked under her body and 1 leg sticking out.she is always so cute,even when i scold her.she is 1yr and 2 mths now and we are still waiting anxiously for her to be a mummy.she is very choosy about her food and refuses to take anything that is very hard(e.g toast).  hope to capture some cute pics of her husband 'pepe le pew'(french name of the character in looney tunes).he is more vocal and active than freesia,so very hard to catch him sitting still.
