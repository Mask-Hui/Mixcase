I'm preparing to go whitewater rafting on the  urlLink Ocoee River  in southeast Tennessee later this month with a group from church.  Surprisingly, I'm less concerned about the inherent danger of rafting (combined with the fact that I can't swim) than I am about how I'll keep the blogging streak (currently 38 days) alive being gone all day Friday.  Or at least I was until this morning.  Dave, our trip coordinator, gave us an itinerary this morning.  Part of it reads:   The trip lasts about 3 hours   My eyes grew large, and I asked, 'Three hours?!  We're going to be in the raft for three hours?!'  Jacob quickly shot back.  'Well, in and out of the raft.'
