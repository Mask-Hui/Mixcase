I'm preparing to go whitewater rafting on the urllink ocoee river in southeast tennessee later this month with a group from church. Surprisingly, i'm less concerned about the inherent danger of rafting (combined with the fact that i can't swim) than i am about how i'll keep the blogging streak (currently 38 days) alive being gone all day friday. Or at least i was until this morning. Dave, our trip coordinator, gave us an itinerary this morning. Part of it reads: the trip lasts about 3 hours my eyes grew large, and i asked, 'three hours?! we're going to be in the raft for three hours?!' jacob quickly shot back. 'well, in and out of the raft.'
