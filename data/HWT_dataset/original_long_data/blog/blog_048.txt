88th in what? brett card farve master research? thats pretty cool though.. So yeah.. Congrats mark on being a movie vault reviewer.. This is your foot in the door when it comes to pursuing a career in the english language.. So when are they adding you to the payroll? imagine yourself getting picked up by rolling stone or maxim.. Thatd be crazy.. Not an artsy fartsy mag either, cuz youre too much of a jackass to write straight laced.. Unless it involves you shaking hands with a giant cartoon dollar sign, that is, then itd be ok.. So the new movie is up.. A bad day .. It kinda lost its glow to me because ive probably watched it 39 times for editting purposes, but it feels good to have that scratched off my checklist of to do's.. I got a couple other projects in the works but id like to get together for some more filmage.. Maybe a horror/comedy movie.. We'll see, chelsea..
