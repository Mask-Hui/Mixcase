First of all let me start by saying - no official offer has been made, we are not considering it, we do not wish to move right now. So i go home yesterday to find an e-mail from the pwc partner that i met with in july. He recently moved to the tulsa office and he e-mailed me asking if i would consider moving to tulsa to work in his office. Wow. This is huge. Now i am not exactly packing my bags, but i am so honored. I told him to tell me his thoughts and that i would need incentive to move. I am not about to tell a partner 'hell no'. I shall play the game. I posted awhile back about being an adult. Well i am officially an adult. I admit it. Not only that, i am an adult with a career. I am not simply a college student who works full time. I had a partner of a big 4 ask me to change states for an entry level position (because i have never audited before). This is huge. I am sure one of the reasons is that i impressed him, obviously, but also the austin office may not be hiring right now. My sweetie has this theory 'you know, i was thinking about why martin wants you in -his- office (aside from the usual 'no space in austin') - your interview impressed him because you made him discuss something he was passionate about. He is dedicated to that subject and by initiating a discussion about it, he knows you are of the same mind set.' i think he might be right. I will keep everyone updated on the dance. Is this a waltz or a tango?
