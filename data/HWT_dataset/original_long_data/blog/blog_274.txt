Sometimes.. I get jealous. I wish that the people that i love and care about could be happy. I want them to be overflowing and brimming with happiness. Sometimes, some people just don't deserve it. Sometimes, some people really really deserve it. I teared up this morning thinking about what happened and how she deserved every ounce of happiness she received today. But it also made me think of another someone and how i wanted her to get every bit of happiness that she deserved to receive and how today was supposed to be her day but it wasn't. And it made me very jealous. How selfish of me. And what a horrible person i am.
