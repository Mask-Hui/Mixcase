You have no idea how weird I'm feeling right now.&nbsp;  It's 6:30 in the evening and dinner is on the table, but to me it feels like morning, because I just got up, having gone to bed&nbsp;3 hours previously.&nbsp; I don't take naps; this is why.&nbsp; My sleep schedule is gonna be off for a week.&nbsp; Anyway, they want me down at the dinner table, but to me it's breakfast, and it's way to early for me to be able to handle it. Ok, I've had a shower I'm a little better now.&nbsp; We just saw Seussical! and one of the characters was so Thomas it was funny.&nbsp; Thomas, you are now Horton the Elephant. Then we&nbsp;played DnD until until the wee hours of the night.&nbsp; I was a drunken mad dwarf.&nbsp; It was fun. Then I got carwashed.&nbsp; ANd cars got washed by me, and so did the dog only not really.&nbsp; Ok, more sleep now.&nbsp; Adios! Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlett letter, and, of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlett letter running by her side! Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!
