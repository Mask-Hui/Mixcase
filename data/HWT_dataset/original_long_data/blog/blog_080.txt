You have no idea how weird i'm feeling right now.&nbsp; it's 6:30 in the evening and dinner is on the table, but to me it feels like morning, because i just got up, having gone to bed&nbsp;3 hours previously.&nbsp; i don't take naps; this is why.&nbsp; my sleep schedule is gonna be off for a week.&nbsp; anyway, they want me down at the dinner table, but to me it's breakfast, and it's way to early for me to be able to handle it. Ok, i've had a shower i'm a little better now.&nbsp; we just saw seussical! and one of the characters was so thomas it was funny.&nbsp; thomas, you are now horton the elephant. Then we&nbsp;played dnd until until the wee hours of the night.&nbsp; i was a drunken mad dwarf.&nbsp; it was fun. Then i got carwashed.&nbsp; and cars got washed by me, and so did the dog only not really.&nbsp; ok, more sleep now.&nbsp; adios! behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlett letter, and, of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlett letter running by her side! come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!
