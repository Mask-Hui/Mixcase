And so yeah im sick, despite of the fever and the difficulty and all i went to the gym to sweat it out, thinking maybe a little body movement would work, so with the abdominal exercises and a little cardiovascular stuff would work, so yeah it helped a little but as soon as i finished the fever comes back and i am feeling uber weak again. Then right after my gym bout, we went to wilbert, my gay friend's party, pigged out on fatty stuff and split went to the office and then my boss goes, hey , you seem to have monday sickness and i go yeah, i was really sick boss. Well cant blame him, my absences became so predictable its either on a monday or a friday (for longer weekends? but nah) now for real, i have to go to a doctor coz im having trouble breathing already but the stubborn chainsmoker in me keeps on puffing man. Its like when your so fuckin full, and you need to do something abt it its either you puke some of it outta ur system or smoke or drink coke. Problem is, i cant drink coke, first up, i cut carbonated drinks out of my diet program (yeah as if there is a diet program) and that its acid in a way. I have trouble with acid dude, coz i was diagnosed last year as to laymans terms; having a thin layer left on my throat before it gives up due to too much acid and ey, my years of bulimia, so see i cant even puke some stuff out or im gna suffer an operation of the throat or a heart problem and im not ready for that, 1st, my throat is my bread and butter, i talk endlessly as a customer service rep and 2nd my heart still needs some real complication before it gets unusely complicated (get what i mean, it needs loveee first duh, bwehehehehe.). Im so full of issues today, issues that cant be discussed over coffee but can only be discussed with a doctor. So double pay or not i have to go to the doc tom. Than suffer for the rest of my life. :)
