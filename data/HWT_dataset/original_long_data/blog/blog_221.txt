A cool book  > http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=ZYw1VjLo4E&isbn=1573222666&itm=1  -----  Anyways , I seem to be buying more music lately, from itunes. I got a total of 20 songs from then in a week.   Ross and the other soon to be EMT's have been going to ER to observe and assist when allowed. I will be doing this next year as I will be taking to course.  Ross had said to me 'instead of being a laywer should I become a ER doctor? ' I told him that he atleast has some idea as to what he wants to do in life.   As far as me , I know for certain I want to do something in the Law Enforcment field. I really enjoy it. I dont know whether it be for local PD or FBI ( most likely what I want) or Homeland security , im not sure.
