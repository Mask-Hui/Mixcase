A cool book > http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?userid=zyw1vjlo4e&isbn=1573222666&itm=1 ----- anyways , i seem to be buying more music lately, from itunes. I got a total of 20 songs from then in a week. Ross and the other soon to be emt's have been going to er to observe and assist when allowed. I will be doing this next year as i will be taking to course. Ross had said to me 'instead of being a laywer should i become a er doctor? ' i told him that he atleast has some idea as to what he wants to do in life. As far as me , i know for certain i want to do something in the law enforcment field. I really enjoy it. I dont know whether it be for local pd or fbi ( most likely what i want) or homeland security , im not sure.
