Wow, i'm really sick. I stayed home today. Hope people didn't think i was a big loser and stayed home causei lost. Oh well. Anyway, i have no idea what i have. I think it's just a bad sinus infection, but daddy said it may be bronchitis. Again. Isn't that wonderful. May have a side of strep, too, but no one really knows. That's what happens when mommy isn't here to take me to the doctor, and daddy's ego gets so big that he thinks i don't need one. Anyway, i'll probably see most of yall at the sat tomorrow. Josh, hope you had fun on your french adventure.
