I'm sick!  Which sucks, but what sucks more is that I can't figure out why.  Usually I can pinpoint questionable food or other cause, but this time I guess I'm just sick.  I've been up since 4 in the morning with a terrible stomach ache.  I ate some toast from very old bread, it was in the freezer and smelled liked it.  I don't think it helped.  I had a glass of water, but my cats drank it while I was asleep.  (Fuzzy Bastards!)  So now, I'm feeling a little better, not enough to venture outside or anything, but I'm good enough to game on the couch.  I'm thinkin some Crazy Taxi, maybe a little Crash Team Racing, follow it up with some Final Fantasy X-2.  Or read.  Which sounds sophisticated, until you realize I mean the graphic novels I borrowed from the library (pretty pictures, woooow)  I watched a depressing Sliders.  Bastards got home and left.  They arrived and had 55 seconds till the next Slide so they were trying to figure out if they were home.  They looked at a newspaper and saw OJ charged with double murder and that the Raiders were in the finals.  Then Quinn said that they would know if they were home if the gate in front of his house squeaked.  It didn't, (his mom got it fixed).  They left.  I was pissed.  I never saw that one before.  I remember when they told Sam Beckett he was never going to get home on Quantum Leap, I hated that.  Well, I'm going to go back to moaning pathetically on my couch.
