Saturday we took Connor to Firemans Park, thinking that the Fireman's Easter Egg Hunt was to start at 11am. It turned out it was on the Friday. Thank goodness I brought a bag of eggs with me just incase. So Connor had a great time finding eggs out in the park. Sunday morning when he woke up he was so excited that the Easter Bunny had come. There is nothing better then to see the excitement on your childs face.  After egg hunting, we all went to church. Even though the 'Easter Bunny' is fun and all. We do make sure our kids know the true meaning of the holidays.  This was Megan's first Easter, she looked so cute dressed in her jean dress and stockings :)
