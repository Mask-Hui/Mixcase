Coffee, coffee, coffee...mmmm, I love coffee. Which is unfortunate, cause it ain't readily available in Jecheon. Sure, there are some places you can get real coffee - not in my usual path, unfortunately. And you can get that pseudo-instant-faux coffee everywhere, but really...can we actually call that stuff coffee? Yeah, yeah, I know I could make it myself...but that's not the point. In Seoul there are plenty of coffee shops all over the place, usually blatantly attempting to imitate Starbucks name or logo. (But who wants to drink coffee at a place called Coobucks?)  Anyways, I have been drinking this premixed instant coffee stuff at work pretty much since I've been in Korea. It comes in a little package with creamer and sugar already added, so all you have to do is add water. Its really handy, and though it isn't great coffee, it has that one vital component - caffeine. I've become a little addicted to the stuff. Maybe more than a little addicted. In fact, it has lately occurred to me that I've been drinking way too much of it and I should quit, or at least cut back. Just at work. Sniff, sniff. I'll really miss you, Maxim Mocha Gold instant coffee. Where will I get my caffeine fix now?   Ode to caffeine  Oh, caffeine, you're my best friend without you, I can't pretend that I won't fall asleep and snore While teaching Basic-C4 I won't be able To sit at the table I'll slip right under and hit my head on the floor
