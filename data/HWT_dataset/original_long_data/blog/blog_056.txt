Self-promotion i updated this thing three times yesterday, and the last two just now got on. Please read. Because i said so. I am 23 years old. The only explanation of why i almost went into cardiac arrest when jordan was making out with angela in the boiler room last night is because jared leto was actually probably 23 at the time and not in high school, which makes me not so dirty and perverted. Oh god is he a good kisser. I swatched four times for my mom's sweater. I've never swatched that much. The pattern called for 9s but i'm using 10.5s. It took me three and then some episodes to swatch (episode one), cast one and work four rows completely wrong two different times (the rest). The first time, i couldn't read. The second time, i couldn't read the chart. But this is my first time working with a chart. The sweater is seeming really...wide, but i've only done three rows and it's in a 2-4 rib pattern, so it will undoubtedly not be that wide once the rib gets going. Right? and there are cables everywhere. And i can't find my stupid cable needle. So i'm using a 7 dpn, which is working quite smashingly, actually. My goals tonight is not to have to rip the thing to hell and back. I am, technically, an intermediate knitter, but i've never attempted a project of this magnitude. I'm usually all about color, not texture. This should be really neat. That is, if i don't keep holding the 7 dpn in my mouth between cables. Bamboo tastes like total crap.
