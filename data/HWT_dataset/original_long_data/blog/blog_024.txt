School! who hoo!! first day of school for me (for this semester) starts tonight! yay! i have soooooooo missed communing with the peeps who think about deep educational stuff n' sheet... Not that my regular hommies don't or anything {kisses! i lurv you all} -- it's just... Well... I have certain needs that just don't get met in my everyday life - intellectually , i mean..... Eh, hem... Anyways... Just had lunchie-poo with the fabulous sah , el torrito and tall guy ... They, as a crew, are super delightful and it is always great to hear the things with your previous company are continuing to go to hell in a handbasket ... I think though, that i might have had a slightly more cheery time if for our next get-together we restrict the gathering the tiniest bit more ... K. I'm really just stalling while the it guys figure out how to get me write access to some server-age which i think they may have just done, so... Looks like i'm out!
