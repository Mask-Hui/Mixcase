School!  Who Hoo!! First day of  school  for me (for this semester) starts TONIGHT! yay! I have soooooooo missed communing with the peeps who think about deep educational stuff n' sheet... Not that my  regular hommies  DON'T or anything {kisses! I lurv you all} -- it's just... well... i have certain  needs  that just don't get met in my everyday life -  intellectually , I mean..... eh, hem... anyways...  Just had  lunchie-poo  with the fabulous  SAH ,  El Torrito  and  Tall Guy  ... They, as a crew, are super delightful and it is always great to hear the things with your previous company are continuing to go to  hell in a handbasket ... I think though, that I might have had a slightly more  cheery  time if for our next get-together we  restrict  the gathering the  tiniest  bit more ...  K. I'm really just stalling while the  IT guys  figure out how to get me write access to some server-age which I think they may have just done, so... looks like I'm out!
