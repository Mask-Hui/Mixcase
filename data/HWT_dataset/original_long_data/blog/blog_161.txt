Allow me to flame my own buddies for a second. Allow me to aim my gun at my own comrades, and squeeze off a few rounds in their backs just because I can because I lag behind. It seems that eek and grimes love their websites and html. Now I can respect that. If they want to practice something that's actually going to be useful to them later on in life, I'm not gonna stop them. And I respect their html code writing skills. But they want to go beyond that for their websites. Websites that could possibly be abandoned in a year or less. Investing 200$ in hosting, and 60$ in movable type just doesn't seem reasonable to me. I mean, the website has no real purpose. It's their game site, yes, but seriously, how many hits does it get, and are there repeat visitors? No. Not really. Now I'm not complaining about them learning html code. And I'm not jealous of them for doing it. I just can't. And seriously, in tomorrows job market. Our job market, there's going to be too many Einstein's, and not enough average grunts. I for one don't mind hard work. I just don't want a desk job. No. That's not for me. Anyways. I'm just trying to make a few friends realize that they might wanna spend less time on html. And more time being kids.  Childhood only happens once. Blink, and you miss it.
