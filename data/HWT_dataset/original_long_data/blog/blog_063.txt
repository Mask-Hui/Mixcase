I'm so tired because i've taken too many personality tests. I have so many problems. I'm a paranoid, narcissitic guy with multiple personalities and strong anti-social tendencies. But i do like sharks. And anacondas. You know that if i could a get a pet right this very minute and have it be at my house when i get home, i'd have to pick a king cobra. Do you know how awesome those things are? they are awesome to the max-treme! i've seen several in zoos and i just want to have one for my own because they just look so sweetbees.
