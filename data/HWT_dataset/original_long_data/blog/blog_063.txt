I'm so tired because I've taken too many personality tests.  I have so many problems.  I'm a paranoid, narcissitic guy with multiple personalities and strong anti-social tendencies.  But I DO like sharks.  And anacondas.  You know that if I could a get a pet right this very minute and have it be at my house when I get home, I'd have to pick a king cobra.  Do you know how awesome those things are?  They are AWESOME TO THE MAX-TREME!  I've seen several in zoos and I just want to have one for my own because they just look so sweetbees.
