Well, things are incredibly busy here at times...but there's always time for supposed stress relieving activities.  I've found that I really suck at 8-Ball and Ping Pong!  Rick(the Canuck) beats my ass on a regular basis - we have a ping pong table in the front lobby of our building, always time for a 'quick round'.  Last night I participated in an 8-Ball tournament over at the Hot Spot (our recreation tent - complete with popcorn machine, numerous TV's, jukebox, DVD rental, pool table, dart board, and ever present ping pong table).  Anyway, I was doing pretty well throughout my one entire game - until I scratched on the eight ball ;(  I still had a fairly good time - the most fun was the two Dutch soldiers that joined in the tournament.  These guys were a hoot, except for when they were busting on me for drinking a Non alcohol Beck's beer...you see, all our coalition forces partners can consume alcohol.  The Italians are especially known for their wine, most the other forces have their contingent of beers.  The torturous thing for me of course is the fact that the Dutch have Heineken and Grolsch at their disposal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I know there are some of our American forces making goodwill ambassador visits to the other compounds and accepting the hospitable gifts of alcohol...but for me, as tempting as it is - the thought of losing a stripe or receiving any punishment because I can't get over my love for beer...just ain't worth it.
