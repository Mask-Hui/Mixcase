I just got back from watching a friend of a friend's band play at Bud's. Had a few drinks. Yes I do have to work at 8. I met a great girl - she seemed intelligent as well as attractive. Even though she seemed to like me alot I never said too much to her and I never got her number, damn. You know how hard it is to talk to someone during live music. Especially for me, I have terrible 'bar hearing'. I wish I knew how to do these things. Hopefully I'll run into her some other time.  My friend said that he is going back to the hometown this weekend. I might go. It all depends. I don't really feel like the drive. But my parents are gone, which is bad and good. I can stay out all night or at least get some reading done. Hmmm, tough choice.
