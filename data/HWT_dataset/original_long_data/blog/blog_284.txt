I just got back from watching a friend of a friend's band play at bud's. Had a few drinks. Yes i do have to work at 8. I met a great girl - she seemed intelligent as well as attractive. Even though she seemed to like me alot i never said too much to her and i never got her number, damn. You know how hard it is to talk to someone during live music. Especially for me, i have terrible 'bar hearing'. I wish i knew how to do these things. Hopefully i'll run into her some other time. My friend said that he is going back to the hometown this weekend. I might go. It all depends. I don't really feel like the drive. But my parents are gone, which is bad and good. I can stay out all night or at least get some reading done. Hmmm, tough choice.
