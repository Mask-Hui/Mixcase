Today i tried to attempt the first part of the task 1. Of module 1. We had to connect to deakin library using telnet. Following the instructions was very easy until it was time to connect to deakin library. The instruction given in the tast sheet was not enough for a new user. For e.g. The tast sheet said just to type 'library.deakin.edu.au', but that didn't work. I kept getting an error message. So a friend of mine helped me out. He suggested that i add 'open.library.deakin.edu.au'. Problem solved! so instead of microsoft telnet>library.deakin.edu.au we had to write microsoft telnet>open.library.deakin.edu.au but that not all! i could only get through to deakin library at random attempts. This maybe due to high traffic or time difference. I have seen people use telnet during my brief fellowship at the indian national scientific and documentation center, newdelhi, in 1998 but i didn't realise that was telnet until i tried using it today. I found this task really simple but there were some of my classmates who found it really difficult to grasp the idea of telnet and following the instructions and came to be for help. So i helped them as best as i could. I think their problems were all because of lack of background knowledge on the infrastructure of internet. Anways, that it for now... Cheers shabz
