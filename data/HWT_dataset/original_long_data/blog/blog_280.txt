Not much to write about today. College seriously stressed me out though. All this writing she has got me doing is driving me insane... It isn't why i chose art!&nbsp; if i wanted to fucking write endlessly i would of chose english. Ahh well. The girl (aimee) from the gallery called me a good few times today. Seems cool though i suppose. Also, laura gave me a ringydizzle which was quite fun... We had a good old 'chit-chat' about the party!&nbsp;oh yeah, and so did lisa. Nothing major happened today. Except i got told i have to move out. But that's all. Everyday kind of stuff really.
