Not much to write about today. College seriously stressed me out though. All this writing she has got me doing is driving me insane... it isn't why I chose art!&nbsp; If I wanted to fucking write endlessly I would of chose English. Ahh well. The girl (Aimee) from the gallery called me a good few times today. Seems cool though I suppose. Also, Laura gave me a ringydizzle which was quite fun... we had a good old 'chit-chat' about the party!&nbsp;Oh yeah, and so did Lisa. Nothing major happened today. Except I got told I have to move out. But that's all. Everyday kind of stuff really.
