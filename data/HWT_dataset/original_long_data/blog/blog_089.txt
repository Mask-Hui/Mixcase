Urllink homebake...wow. It was a long but awesome day...john butler trio, machine gun fellatio, alex lloyd, something for kate, augie march, eskimo joe, kasey chambers, skunkhour and more....tomorrow ;) hopefully! sorry, i have to go re-attach my feet. They just fell off ;) up top is me playing in the kiddie fountain in which somebody dumped a lot of bubble mix in ;) urllink the other pic of me and gavin during kasey chambers' set. The music made me feel like riding a horse, so that's my horse-riding demonstration. That also explains why gavin is pretending not to know me.
