Ahhh the time has come to prove my worth in the Singapore Dragonboat Festival as I participated in the race.  Finally, the trainings and hardwork was put to the test.  Ok... we didnt win but I enjoyed hanging out with the team... as a matter of fact I enjoy being part of a team.    Before the race started I told myself I'm going to give my 110%.  But when it finished, I realized I'm just an element of the team. Even if I have the will to give 200%, I probably wont be able to lift the entire crew.  Coordination, commitment, understanding, cooperation, teamwork and patience are the core values needed to build a successful team.  Hmmm... these values sounds very applicable to a relationship doesn't it?
