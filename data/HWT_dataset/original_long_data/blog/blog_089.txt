Ahhh the time has come to prove my worth in the singapore dragonboat festival as i participated in the race. Finally, the trainings and hardwork was put to the test. Ok... We didnt win but i enjoyed hanging out with the team... As a matter of fact i enjoy being part of a team. Before the race started i told myself i'm going to give my 110%. But when it finished, i realized i'm just an element of the team. Even if i have the will to give 200%, i probably wont be able to lift the entire crew. Coordination, commitment, understanding, cooperation, teamwork and patience are the core values needed to build a successful team. Hmmm... These values sounds very applicable to a relationship doesn't it?
