urlLink    Homebake...wow. It was a long but awesome day...John Butler Trio, Machine Gun Fellatio, Alex Lloyd, Something for Kate, Augie March, Eskimo Joe, Kasey Chambers, Skunkhour and more....tomorrow ;) Hopefully! Sorry, I have to go re-attach my feet. They just fell off ;) Up top is me playing in the kiddie fountain in which somebody dumped a lot of bubble mix in ;)  urlLink    The other pic of me and Gavin during Kasey Chambers' set. The music made me feel like riding a horse, so that's my horse-riding demonstration. That also explains why Gavin is pretending not to know me.
