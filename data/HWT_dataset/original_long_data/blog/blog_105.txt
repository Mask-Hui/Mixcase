My heinous mood has passed. Forthcoming period + forgetting to take prozac until late in the day = very sad, prone to tears kristin. But surprise of boyfriend at my doorstep + ice cream sundae + holding boyfriend's hand after i had a terribly scary dream in which people started shooting machine guns at the news bureau = kristin feeling better. And i don't have to work this morning la la la la la but i do have to call a man at kmiz to get his rate card. And tonight i get to see two of my best girls, amy and kate (hopefully with time to study in between). And tomorrow maybe i will see someone i haven't seen for quite awhile for our ww date. And maybe one of these days i will see abby because sometimes she doesn't come home. Running late, as per usual. Roxy is asleep.
