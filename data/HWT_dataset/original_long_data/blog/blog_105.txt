My heinous mood has passed.  Forthcoming period + forgetting to take prozac until late in the day = very sad, prone to tears Kristin.  BUT surprise of boyfriend at my doorstep + ice cream sundae + holding boyfriend's hand after I had a terribly scary dream in which people started shooting machine guns at the News Bureau = Kristin feeling better.  And I don't have to work this morning la la la la la but I do have to call a man at KMIZ to get his rate card.  And tonight I get to see two of my best girls, Amy and Kate (hopefully with time to study in between).  And tomorrow maybe I will see someone I haven't seen for quite awhile for our WW date.  And maybe one of these days I will see Abby because sometimes she doesn't come home.    Running late, as per usual.  Roxy is asleep.
