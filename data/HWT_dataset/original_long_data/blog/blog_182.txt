Ok, so I have yet to see what my blog will actually look like. But apparently, this is the place to start. I am not quite sure what will be happening here; whether I will take to it and whatnot, but since I spend so much of my time in front of a machine, I might as well make proper use of my time and post all these bits of craziness that whiz around, nay stumble around more like, in my head. I was insipired by a blogger (who I never met in person), who managed to keep us up to date in the most intimate fashion about her day to day existance, and somewhat entertained at the same time... while I have no such aspirations of my own, I guess for the most part, I want this to be cathartic, and I guess, liberating, in a weird disclosure kind of way...
