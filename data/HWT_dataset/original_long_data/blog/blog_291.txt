So it’s Friday. Last nights Friends was a good one. I had my last history class before Spring break today. My teacher has assigned a book report for over the break. That kind of sucks. The weather is getting better. It has been raining for days, but in the 60’s. I have been getting the house cleaned. I got the floors all mopped. I painted my toenails blue since it is going to be sandals season soon. What an exciting life I lead!  In other news, I saw that Richard Simmons was charged with assault after he slapped a guy in an airport for making fun of his Sweatin’ To The Oldies videos. I saw that there was a four eared cat in Germany who finally found a family to adopt it. That was kind of creepy and weird.   I am sure you have heard that there is currently a case in the Supreme Court that will decide whether the words “under God” belong in the Pledge Of Allegiance. As the case goes, a man took a school district in California to court because he didn’t think his child saying those words was constitutional. He is an atheist and feels that every time his daughter said the pledge it was like a slap in the face to him. What I find odd about the whole situation is that he does not have custody of the child, the mother does. And what is even odder is that the mother is raising the daughter as a Christian, as she is one herself. Also, as it turns out, the daughter doesn’t really care either way. The way I see it, when you say the pledge, you are pledging to the country and the words “Under God” do not necessarily mean anything religious, but something said out of respect for the men who founded this country, who were Christian. It is traditional, like the words “In God We Trust” printed on our money or the prayers that are offered before sessions of Congress or the Supreme Court. However, the reason that they put those words in, in 1954, was to show how we were better than those godless communists. So that in it self may be unconstitutional. I don’t know. It all seems kind of like a waste of the courts time to me. There is no law saying that the little girl has to say the pledge at all. So why bother taking all this time and money to decide it. People really have gone kind of sue-happy. I saw on the news that most Americans think the pledge should stay how it is. (Also for those who can't remember the words: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States Of America, and to the rupublic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.)  So that is all the news for today. Tomorrow is my last class before Spring Break. I am just one biology class away from freedom for a whole week. And my friend Cari is coming over tomorrow. Sounds like it’s going to be a good weekend. And the best part, today I saw my tulips and things shooting up.
