today i bought a whole lot of squash. it was so cheap, and so tantalizing. how, you may ask, can one be tantalized by squash? i believe that it is because of the sheer possibility that the squash represents. there are  thousands  of ways to cook squashes--many of them are cheap, and all are full of regularity-producing fiber. so right now my stomach is growling, the spaghetti squash is cooking in the oven, and i'm already thinking of ways to cook the butternut squash i also purchased. and another thing is that squash are representative of my favorite time of year. i truly relish autumn.  not a bad day, all in all. classes were long and only marginally interesting, but i definitely had jesus sitting next to me for the quiz yesterday, since i managed to extract a passing grade from a truly dismal set of circumstances. i wonder how jody did, if jesus was sitting next to  me ? was he simultaneously next to her? did he give her more right answers than he gave me? maybe he likes her better because she didn't work in an abortion clinic this summer. i guess i'll never know.
