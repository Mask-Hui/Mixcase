Ok i get it the raps sucked, i was drunk and i can't good write (look bad grammer). From now on i'll leave the rapping to jj and our favourite teddyg. By the way bates, i drank the bacardi silver because it was there and i wanted to get drunk quick and beer is just to watered down. It wasn't even mine it was my parents so i don't care. Not my money. The only reason i rapped was because this site is getting stale as fucking hell. Just look. All bateman does is show the feedback, i'm giving you shitty raps and no one else even posts. How shit is that? i know that our audience is down to 2 to 5 people at best. When i'm writing this i'm talking to bateman and 3 other people because no one reads this shit anymore. I could rip up huddy or bishop and they wouldn't know it (i won't because those guys get much pleutonic love from me) i'm just saying if our bloggers can't even post why should anyone else even read this shit? i gotta go because i have to be up in 5 hours for work (god damnit). I just hope this rant will inspire someone to post again. And cowie mail in a creative post. I know that you are smarter than most of the people on the blog, wake it out of its sleep. Lates sleepy time
