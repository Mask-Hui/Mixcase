Alright so I opted for sleep over editing the layout, like it matters.  I can't feel my arms; alright; I can barely feel my arms, my neighbour's lawn mower is too freaking heavy. Its like pushing around a wheel-barrow full of fat kids, and we all know how dam heavy fat kids tend to be. But I'm glad to say I'm 20 dollars richer for having done it, money which could be going towards a new game seings as how I now have around 70 some odd dollars. However since I am planning on a little trip next week I think the game shall have to wait, for how long I don't know.  And that's my cue to exit. I'll probably be blogging again when I get home tonight, for those of you who care. There are people who care right? Right?  Mommy?
