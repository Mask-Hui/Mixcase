Today in iran is mother day.it's different than the other countries so some lucky mothers who are not here in iran celebrates both of them ;) in our custome we go to our mothers home and spend our moments together, usually buy a gift for them to show that we always remember them and their works to grow up us,( this part is very interesting because husbands must give their wife a gift too:d mehrdad always says'it's better to name this day: mother,wife,mother- in- law day because poor men should buy gifts for all of them') but from the view point of myself today ,beyond all of the gifts and jokes and being togetehr, is just a reminder for us to thank this nice angel ,called mom, who really do whatever she could for her child and don't expect anything ,she is a fountain of love and one of the best things that god give us. I do appreciate all mothers of the world.happy mother day.
