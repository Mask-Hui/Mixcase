Hello people, Welcome to my blog spot... ;) You may not understand what is going on since I'm writing spontaneously on what is happening around me. I just told Nigel what Kamil told Pn Norzakia. So I heard, Nigel called up Kamil instantly to confirm it but Kamil changed his story.  *roll eyes* I just typed from my 'offline blog' to prove that Kamil did say that Nigel wanted us to be MIA during chemistry periods. I wonder why so few people are actually online, while those that are online are busy or away... Now Keane is apologizing for forgetting to return my add math book. I was just playing around with Nigel scaring him about how angry Pn Norzakia was over that statement. Now Nigel is quite worried from the way he is talking that he may be in hot soup.  Back to what happened today, I missed a whole day of school today. I'm happy (missed some boring biology and history periods *Yippee* but missed some Maths periods *shivers*) Besides that I missed my accounts tuition. *more shivers* I only came home at 4.30 pm after walking to the LRT station with Ben and very tired... but it was fun wearing a lab coat and messing around with the lab tools. I received an email from an old friend Jun Ai and messages from other old friends. I seem to be mistaken for another Joel from SSP. *Frustrated*  Earlier on, June saw my bunny via web-cam and kept saying 'SO CUTE!!! SO CUTE!!! I WANT!!!'. I guess most gals just love such furball bunnies. ;) Syahmi was kind of mysterious. He didnt want to tell me who dumped him although it was clearly not his so-called girlfriend. I suspect its just a pathetic joke.  It looks I may have just sparked off a new craze with this blog. Now Nigel is getting a blog after reading mine. I'm sure everyone will start getting a blog spot. Anyway, I'm running low on inspiration to write poems.. If you didnt know of my poem site, its at http://www.mystcaverns.tk/ Hmmm.. looking back at what I've typed, not bad for my first official entry. I've school tomorrow. Goodnite ppl. :D
