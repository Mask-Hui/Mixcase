I keep forgetting what I'm going to be writing this post about.  First off,  urlLink Gmail . This screenshot alone shows why it's better than Hotmail:     On my  urlLink shiity dialup connection , Hotmail often times out when loading a page after I send an email, and so I have no idea whether it sent or not. Gmail on the other hand, is always exceedingly speedy, and so I'm in love. Microsoft and their MSN/Hotmail outfit had better do something pretty fucking special to keep people using their bloated crap.  Secondly, I downloaded and installed the latest  urlLink Firefox  - v0.9 rc1. I am of the opinion that these guys and gals spend more time designing the icons than anything else. The icons for v0.8 were nigh-on perfect, but they've gone and changed them for 0.9, and to be honest, it looks more primitive because of it. 0.8 was lush and colourful, but this is stark and Internet Explorer 3-like:     Yuck.
