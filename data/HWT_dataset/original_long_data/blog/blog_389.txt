I am convinced that when people become customers they lose their common sense. Why is that? Why do people become so dumb? Why would you ask me what I put in blizzards to make it so chocolatey? Um....chocolate? How 'bout that, einstein. Why would people tell me that their order is to go in the drive thru? Why? WHY?! Why do you allow yourselves to be so dumb? Please, I beg of you, THINK before you speak! Before you have a hissy fit that you don't have any ketchup, please look on your tray first. I bet cha that's where it'll be. And whatever you do, for the love of god and all things that are holy, DO NOT insult the people who are making your food. Are seriously (sorry Urs) RETARDED???????!!!!! You call me stupid, slow and yell at me then expect me to make your blizzard minus the spit and doggy biscuts.....uh, yeah. I don't really think I am asking for much here. ALL that I want is for people to think before they speak. It's not world peace, I know that if we work together, not only as a community but as a nation, we can end stupidity. After that, we can take on the Americans.
