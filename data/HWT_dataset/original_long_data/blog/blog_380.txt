I'm really tired of people who feel that they have to get drunk or stoned to meet someone.  Long story, but I just got back from a party at a friend's where people were puking all over and everyone was really drunk and hitting on each other.  Yeah, that might be fine in college or whatever, but man, I'm way beyond that.  I don't want to hook up with someone cause I think they're hot after a few drinks and a few hits, you know?  I want to really get to know someone for who they are, not who they think they are after a few beers.  And it's like, come on, we're all like 24 or 25, you think we could all get through a night without all passing out.  It's not like we're all 18 again!  And why does everyone feel a need to try to meet that 'someone' at a party like that.  I will never understand!  Anyway, a sad night, but I ran into a few old high school friends and some of Jen's friends from law school, so that was kinda fun! :)  Oh well, there's some better way to meet people out there I'm sure.  Someday I'll find that single, cool, outdoors-loving, environmentalist, economist and onion reading, intelligent, fun girl with a positive attitude! :)  Goodnight all!
