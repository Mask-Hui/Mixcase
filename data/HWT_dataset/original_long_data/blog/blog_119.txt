Friday morning. 8 a.m. What the heck?    Yeah, I'm online. Not in bed. I've had time to add another toy to my blog site, as well as a few comments to other blogs. I've begun to compile songs for a CD I want to put together, featuring prominent songs in my life (I will probably blog the playlist once I've got it figured out). I've watched Elliot Moose and Peep with Katya... oh yeah, that's why I'm up. That dear child is convinced that the moment the sun begins to peek over the horizon, it's time to get up and get dressed. I've at least managed to keep her in her nightie. Well, until just a moment ago when she put on her so-called 'Sleeping Beauty dress' - a large red satin dress that was once used at someone's wedding by a junior bridesmaid.    Later this morning we'll be going to visit my mom and dad. That's a good thing. Mom will often let me have a nap while she looks after Katya. I'm looking forward to that possibility.    Katya is now singing a song that she's making up about Friday. I think I'll go listen.
