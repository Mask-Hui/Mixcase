I'm having severe problems this week making small and unimportant decisions. I spent practically my entire lunch at zabars trying to decide which sushi lunch special i wanted, much to the chagrin of the rushed people behind me. It was like i was in some kind of daze. After about 20 minutes, i decided i didn't want sushi after all so i left and went next door to get a frozen yogurt but couldn't decide on a topping so i neglected the yogurt and walked to felictea where i spent another 20 minutes debating which flavor of bubble tea to order. It was my 10th purchase so it was free. But a simple choice like what to have for lunch should not be so hard. My friend sent me an invitation to join her network on tickle.com. Lots of new quizzes and other such fun! i'd post one but of course i can't decide which. What was i talking about? urllink see if you can find the difference between these two pictures it's difficult. Take your time and look closely.
