Everything is so weird nowadays. It's a change of pace, i'll admit. Well not really, everything feels normal in an ironic sense. Heh. I think i scared randy this morning when i bursted out crying after physics.. Sigh, sorry ti i was thinking about the nature of exams. Right now, i'm questioning why i took physics in the first place. Not that i don't like it, i seriously do enjoy it.. But i just can't seem to grasp its style and method of asking questions. It's so different compared to the type of questions we get in tests in school :s maybe it's just me. Hai~ i don't know. I think i think too much. Lol. Thinking is bad. My thoughts wander and i always seem to end up crying =( it hurts. I thinks i fell down to hard. I had gymnastics this morning, lol. I did i hand stand and landed on my trick knee.. And it's still hurting like crazy right now. Sigh. I should see a doctor about my knee soon. Lol. I've been putting it off for months now. Anton shaved his head! i miss aqilah and lina . A month and a half til reza i've missed you soo much babe okay okay, for once i'll listen to juls and ranz , they're fed up with me and my complaints.. *sniff* haha i will see the doctor by the end of this week k? lol. =)
