Everything is so weird nowadays. It's a change of pace, I'll admit. Well not really, everything feels normal in an ironic sense. Heh. I think I scared  Randy  this morning when I bursted out crying after physics..  sigh, sorry ti    I was thinking about the nature of exams. Right now, I'm questioning why I took physics in the first place. Not that I don't like it, I seriously do enjoy it.. but I just can't seem to grasp its style and method of asking questions. It's so different compared to the type of questions we get in tests in school :S maybe it's just me. Hai~ I don't know.   I think I think too much. lol. Thinking is bad. My thoughts wander and I always seem to end up crying =( It hurts. I thinks I fell down to hard. I had gymnastics this morning, lol. I did I hand stand and landed on my trick knee.. and it's still hurting like crazy right now. Sigh.  I should see a doctor about my knee soon. lol. I've been putting it off for months now.  Anton  shaved his head! I miss  aQilah  and  Lina .  A month and a half til  Reza   I've missed you soo much babe    Okay okay, for once I'll listen to  Juls  and  Ranz , they're fed up with me and my complaints.. *sniff*  haha I  will  see the doctor by the end of this week k? lol. =)
