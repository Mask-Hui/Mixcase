Well i am sure my sisters are drunk off their butts. Today was pride in san diego. I know my sisters and when it is drinking time, it is drinking time. It is the one thing i didn't get from the buenviajes, the want to drink. There are few times i don't mind drinking but let's just say they are very rare times. So we have a month left before ed leaves. I think it is starting to sink in with ed and with all of us. I think it sunk in with me a long time ago. I just hope that ed will be here for bailey's surgery. We have been keeping an eye on his swelling and there definitely is quite a bit of swelling. I know that god will keep his safe. I just hate that he has to go through some kind of surgery, especially with the risks involved with his condition. I guess a parent will never stop worrying. Well i better get going. I like to spend time with ed before he falls asleep. We see very little of each other during the week and when we do we are both trying to balance our sanity with three yelling kids and fatigue. I hope you guys are having a great weekend.
