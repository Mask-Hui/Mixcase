Well, hello there. This is a blog which is, in fact, utterly pointless. I kind of drifted towards the 'insight into the industry' thang, skipped briefly past the 'personal side of a mortgage guy' and arrived resolutely at the 'what the hell am i bothering for?' shop, gazing in through the plate glass window of despair on my own existence and thinking that there really isn't much worth looking at... So, anyway, here it begins and hopefully something meaningful will arise from it. Any comments, questions and general abuse would be... Um... Well, ignored probably, but it's worth a go.
