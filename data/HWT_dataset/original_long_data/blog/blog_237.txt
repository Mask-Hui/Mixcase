God bless the freaks. They were out in full force today at the fremont solstice parade, held in the center of the universe (fremont, of course!). We got there plenty early to meet up with a friend and found some decent real estate for parade watching. Everyone's favorite naked bicyclists were there, in droves! so many more than i expected, though i've never been. The parade was very colorful and had me laughing and smiling almost non-stop. My favorite site there was the group of overdressed bicyclists, complete with cocktails! they just couldn't fathom the idea of naked or underdressed cyclists. Accessorize, accessorize, accessorize!! i made it almost all the way through the parade when i finally decided to find some shade. It was 1pm and i'd already netted a great sunburn on my left arm and face. My husband and friend found me once all was said and done and we met his girlfriend and scored a table at dad watsons. The festival portion was pretty standard, same vendors and causes as usual. We missed the art cars, but i totally forgot about them anyway. We drank some strawberry cooler, kim and caroline enjoyed a gyro and a raspberry shortcake, then we headed towards our respective buses for our journey home. After a two hour nap from 6:30 to 8:30 and a very late dinner, we are wide awake messing with our photos. Good times!!!
