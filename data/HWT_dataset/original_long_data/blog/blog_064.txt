You know what strikes me as funny...  I just saw a commercial for those things that have like classic arcade Pac Man or Dig Dug on them and the massive joystick with the big shiny red button.  Number 1, those things are in like 6' x 6' boxes, and they used to be in these massive arcade machines. Second, the originals probably cost the developers a few hundred dollars a piece to make, and now the little things probably cost like $30.  Third, when they first came out, there was no ESRB to rate the games E, T, M or AO, now, the ESRB has to rate these games, who would honestly be like, 'Oh, I think Dig Dug is too violent for my children.'  None of those games could ever get a rating higher than E, because of their graphics.  Also, you know how ESRB works?  The developer sends in scenes of the most extreme moments in their games, then a panel of parents and teachers and doctors and such rates it based on those.  I can just imagine the 'extreme video' they got for pack man, or pong for that matter.
