Greetings, friends! tuesday is now, and forever shall be, poll day! since things got so fun thanks to banner’s post last week, let’s try to keep the momentum rolling. For the rest of the day, i’ll be accepting ideas for polls. Nothing else really going on of major note, today. Last night i headed over to damon’s in the waterfront to meet the lovebirds and watch the home run derby. Jeanie, i would’ve called you to come have a beer, but you’re already trying to replace me. So there. The derby did not disappoint, as berkman and tejada lit up enron field with many a monster shot to left-center. Quite the entertaining little spectacle. I doubt it’ll live up to tonight’s all-star game, though. Especially since kup and i are headed back to the herminie hacienda after work tonight in order to hook up my dad’s new 46 inches of television fury, so that we can witness the midsummer classic in glorious high definition. Feel free to join us, if you’re in the area. Call before 5:30, and you can meet at my house in the fo’ for a ride out to the boonies. Other big news yesterday included the pubbers getting washed out when we were locked in an early 1-1 tie. We’ll be making it up with a double-dip on sunday. Early indications show that my hammy is at about 95%, so that’s encouraging. Finally, my new carbon leaf album, “indian summer,” arrived yesterday, y’all can rush out to barnes and noble and pick it up starting today. I’ll have some sort of biased review tomorrow, after i listen to it all day at work. Early word is this: it’s very mellow, and a lot less rambunctiously celtic and jammy than “echo, echo.” they sound considerably more refined, and i’m thinking i dig it… stay tuned. If you want a taste, go to carbonleaf.com, and find yourself the ecard under the “news” section. They’ve got three tracks on there, all of which are pretty solid, especially, “what about everything?” the best song on the disc, though, is “one prairie outpost,” although, admittedly, i’m biased, because that’s been one of my favorite songs of theirs for over two years, now. Okay, i’ve rambled enough for now. Post some ideas for a poll, and let’s get crazy—remember, it takes a village to build a blog. Much love, enjoy tuesday -apk
