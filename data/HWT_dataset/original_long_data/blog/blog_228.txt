Woooo.... Its been a real long while since i last wrote anything on my blog... Hmm, this time round should write a really long one... Kekekeke... Was sick since tuesday, but no fever, went to see doctor on wed had a temperature of 37.5 and it went up to 38.6 yesterday morning, went to see doctor again, this time round no medicine but got one day mc... My colleague was thinking i can only go off half way, not immediate, as it was 11am when i came back from the doctor... By the way, on mc supposed to go home immediately, but i didnt, not cos of what my colleague said, but cos i promised to my boss to do something... In the end i left at 2pm, and went home to sleep from 2 plus till 6, which was the time i went for cg... Now got fever again leh, the temperature is 37.7... Heeheehee... Shall get my pantry auntie to boil some liang cha, so far all i had at home was pu tao tang... Maybe tats why the fever doesnt subside... Aiyo, when i sick really no appetite one... Cant finish all my 3 meals yesterday... Eat halfway throw away the food... But now i very happy, cos later after work going to watch harry potter with my uni friend, hopefully my fever subsides by then... If not... Gotta stay cool and meet her...
