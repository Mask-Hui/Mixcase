Well, after a long and in-depth discussion of the merits of rx bandits with vez (hey vez!!), i have come to the conclusion that although the resignation might be a very good album, it is not for the people who are expecting more of the same ska/reggae vibes that were on progress. Although sell you beautiful is an amazing song, it is neither ska nor reggae, and as i bought the album expecting this, i was disappointed, as, i would imagine, all the other people buying this album expecting ska/reggae were. Rx bandits have definitely taken a new direction with this album, i'm just not sure whether i like it or not. Fair play to them for recording it live and all, but a lot of it still sounds very self-indulgent to me. Bring back the ska! see you at the show ceff x
