My phone boyfriend Kenny is coming to town for a Prince concert... Do I really want to meet him??  We have such witty, flirty phone banter.. meeting him just might ruin all the fun. The image I have created is most likely the direct opposite of what he really is.  True, LOOKS DON'T MATTER... Except, well, they do.  To an extent. Because I'm shallow.  I look forward to talking to him everyday... what will keep me going at work if I find out he's a nerd?  Or a jackass?  No, he's definitly not a jackass.  Quite possibly a nerd.  Although, believe or not, It's a sign of utter coolness and masculine security to be going to a Prince concert.  And if we don't click, I don't want any awkwardness.. you know... during the 2 seconds of  a phone transfer.  Is it worth the potential disaster and humuliation, not to mention the fall of a pefectly innocent and ever- so- fun fantasy?
