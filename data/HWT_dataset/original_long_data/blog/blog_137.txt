My phone boyfriend kenny is coming to town for a prince concert... Do i really want to meet him?? we have such witty, flirty phone banter.. Meeting him just might ruin all the fun. The image i have created is most likely the direct opposite of what he really is. True, looks don't matter... Except, well, they do. To an extent. Because i'm shallow. I look forward to talking to him everyday... What will keep me going at work if i find out he's a nerd? or a jackass? no, he's definitly not a jackass. Quite possibly a nerd. Although, believe or not, it's a sign of utter coolness and masculine security to be going to a prince concert. And if we don't click, i don't want any awkwardness.. You know... During the 2 seconds of a phone transfer. Is it worth the potential disaster and humuliation, not to mention the fall of a pefectly innocent and ever- so- fun fantasy?
