Hahahaha, grammar. One of the questions has no right answer. It pissed me off. Lol      You are the grammar Fuhrer. All bow to your authority. You will crush all the inferior people under the soles of your jackboots, and any who question your motives will be eliminated. Your punishment is being the bane of every other person's existence, because you're constantly contradicting stupidity. Everyone will be gunning for you. Your dreams of a master race of spellers and grammarians frighten the masses. You must always watch your back. If only your power could be used for good instead of evil.    urlLink   What is your grammar aptitude?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
