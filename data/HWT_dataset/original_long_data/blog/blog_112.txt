I've been feeling dissatisfied with my life, especially regarding work, for quite some time now. A year since i've graduated and i can say that nothing much has improved. My trip to new zealand has shown that there is more to life than my 9-5 job in a firm that is increasingly becoming tiresome. But expressing a desire to travel all my life was met by disbelief and an exclamation that such a life is unrealistic. Alarmingly, i think that i still don't know what to do in life. The idea of spending 30 years in a career related to what i've studied terrifies me. But am i good enough to make a switch to something completed unrelated to accounting? it all boils down to self-belief i suppose. (gah. I'm just feeling sorry for myself cos i've got no more leave and my vacation is long over and i'm missing someone.)
