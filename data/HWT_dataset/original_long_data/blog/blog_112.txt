I've been feeling dissatisfied with my life, especially regarding work, for quite some time now. A year since I've graduated and I can say that nothing much has improved.   My trip to New Zealand has shown that there is more to life than my 9-5 job in a firm that is increasingly becoming tiresome. But expressing a desire to travel all my life was met by disbelief and an exclamation that such a life is unrealistic.   Alarmingly, I think that I still don't know what to do in life. The idea of spending 30 years in a career related to what I've studied terrifies me. But am I good enough to make a switch to something completed unrelated to accounting? It all boils down to self-belief I suppose.  (Gah. I'm just feeling sorry for myself cos I've got no more leave and my vacation is long over and I'm missing someone.)
