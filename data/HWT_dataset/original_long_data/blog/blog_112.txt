I think that y'all should take a moment to observe that while the rest of the country is in the security land of bert; in nyc, its ernie. Ain't it the truth. So i cut all my hair off. Well, i cut most of my hair off. Around 11 inches to be exact. I have the curly version of the 70's surf cut. But i use more hair product. I worried that i was going to have impulse remorse. That i was going to come back after the haircut screaming and saying 'two years. I grew it out for two years!' but i don't. I love that i don't have to move it when i lay down. I love that its not touching my neck in that creepy way that makes me think i am being followed. I love that i no longer need to carry rubber band around my wrist everywear i go. God bless my hairdresser for not making me get in between length hair to make sure i was ready. I think i look saucy. Alysse is a saint. She took me under her shopping wing and helped me find black pants. I am not a good shopper, but she is a great shopper who guided me through the scariest parts of union square with an authoritative aplomb that i am envious of. I had been bitching that i was trying on all these pants and they all made me look like that roll of cookie dough before you unwrap it to make tasty cookies. I bought two pairs of black pants and a lovely grey dress shirt all under her watchful gaze. The great thing about alysse is that while i will simply buy pants to be able to get the hell out of the store, alysse will not buy anything that doesn't look great on her. Think about that for a minute. How many things have you bought simply because they seemed good conceptually? or you saw them on someone else and they looked great? it took me a long time to get my head around the basic principle that everything looks great in a size two and that i need to see it in my size. We even got to look at the dept store windows and titter at all the ponchos. I pooped out after a few hours, but she just walked me to bart and then went back into the fray. I might be almost ready to go back to school. I just want to find a new lunchbox to go with my back-to-school clothes and i suppose i'm ready.
