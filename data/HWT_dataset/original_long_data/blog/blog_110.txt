I'm not sure whether to be disappointed or relieved. I had a sneaking suspicion that anyone and everyone would rush to comment on the brilliant things that i post every night. I've decided that one of two things is happening. 1) my posts are not nearly as brilliant as i have been led to believe. Or maybe they've only gotten dull since i put up the comment buttons. Either way, i don't seem to be ruffling enough feathers to encite interesting feedback. 2) my friends and family are not nearly as outspoken as they claim to be, ya freakin lame-asses! 'we're liberal. We have something to say about everything.' whatever. We all know where liars go...
