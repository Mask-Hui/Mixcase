I'm not sure whether to be disappointed or relieved.  I had a sneaking suspicion that anyone and everyone would rush to comment on the brilliant things that I post every night.  I've decided that one of two things is happening. 1) My posts are not nearly as brilliant as I have been led to believe.  Or maybe they've only gotten dull since I put up the comment buttons.  Either way, I don't seem to be ruffling enough feathers to encite interesting feedback. 2) My friends and family are not nearly as outspoken as they claim to be, ya freakin lame-asses!  'We're liberal.  We have something to say about everything.'  Whatever.  We all know where liars go...
