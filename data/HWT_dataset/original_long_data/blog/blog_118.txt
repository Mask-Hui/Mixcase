I'm sitting in publications right now. I found out you can type in the blog but you can not read what you guys posted. So I'm wondering how I can possibly get in. I really don't want to go to history. I'm dreading it so much and wish Kristine would ditch with me. I'm so hungry and so happy that I don't have rehersal with Yomi today. Otherwise I think I would have to kill myself. The farther away that boy is from me the better. I'm almost craving that malt that I plan on having at Al's tomorrow. Which Kristine, you are going. No questions. I have decided I will wear a toga to Kacy's party but what doyou wear under a toga? That's my question. OK I got to go class is almost over.
