I'm sitting in publications right now. I found out you can type in the blog but you can not read what you guys posted. So i'm wondering how i can possibly get in. I really don't want to go to history. I'm dreading it so much and wish kristine would ditch with me. I'm so hungry and so happy that i don't have rehersal with yomi today. Otherwise i think i would have to kill myself. The farther away that boy is from me the better. I'm almost craving that malt that i plan on having at al's tomorrow. Which kristine, you are going. No questions. I have decided i will wear a toga to kacy's party but what doyou wear under a toga? that's my question. Ok i got to go class is almost over.
