Today is my last day of summer vacation!  Waaaaaa!  And I have a dentist appointment at 9.  I hate that, but I'd rather get it over with than try to schedule it during the first month of my surgery rotation.  I'm definitely nervous, scared, jittery, and any other words you can think up for 'Hell's no, me's don wanna go' to school.  This is going to be a whole new ball game for me.  As a perfectionist, I love excelling at everything I do.  But starting new things is a bitch.  I hate being a pawn (like I told Cassie: 'I'm going to be the only pawn on the chessboard who insists on moving like a knight'), and I hate not knowing what's going on.  I'm afraid I'm going to lose all sense of perspective locked in the hospital for days on end.  What am I going to do today?  Probably play a lot of FFXI.
