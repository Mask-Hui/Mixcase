My previous post just kept reminding me of a poem/lyric i wrote last year.&nbsp; all day today, this particular one came to mind.&nbsp; it was&nbsp;one i wrote about my husband on april 3, 2003.&nbsp; i was pretty angry then...imagine that. &nbsp; you’ve won april, 3, 2003 &nbsp; there’s too much anger built up inside all the hurt you caused all that you’ve done you’ve won &nbsp; you’ve pushed me away you want it all all to be your way is it too late you made the mistakes live to face the day you pushed me now i’ve walked away my heart no longer yours guarded by these chains don’t try to break them there’s no way you can you’ve won you’ve pushed me away you want it all all to be your way is it too late you made the mistakes live to face the day you pushed me now i’ve walked away don’t cry to me you’re sorry it’s too late for that when did you ever listen you walked all over me don’t think my heart is yours there’s nothing left to give you tore it all to pieces live with what you give you’ve won you’ve pushed me away you want it all all to be your way is it too late you made the mistakes live to face the day you pushed me now i’ve walked away what else did you expect someone to kiss your a$$ my heart locked inside guarded by it’s scars you’ve won &nbsp; copyright 2003, all rights reserved. &nbsp; &nbsp; i just kill myself when i read stuff like that.&nbsp; that was almost a year before our divorce was filed.&nbsp; heck, the marriage was over before this was ever written.&nbsp; i guess i just thought i had to try to make it work, for the kids or it was the right thing to do.&nbsp; it only made things worse and better yet, he found wonderful ways in which to blame me...because of course, he couldn't be any bit to blame for the collapse of our marriage.&nbsp; now i'm being sarcastic...again, attitude (and a bad one).
