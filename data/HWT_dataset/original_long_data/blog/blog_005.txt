My previous post just kept reminding me of a poem/lyric I wrote last year.&nbsp; All day today, this particular one came to mind.&nbsp; It was&nbsp;one I wrote about my husband on April 3, 2003.&nbsp; I was pretty angry then...imagine that. &nbsp;  You’ve Won  April, 3, 2003  &nbsp;  There’s too much anger  Built up inside  All the hurt you caused  All that you’ve done  You’ve won &nbsp; You’ve pushed me away  You want it all  All to be your way  Is it too late  You made the mistakes  Live to face the day  You pushed me  Now I’ve walked away  My heart no longer yours  Guarded by these chains  Don’t try to break them  There’s no way you can  You’ve won   You’ve pushed me away  You want it all  All to be your way  Is it too late  You made the mistakes  Live to face the day  You pushed me  Now I’ve walked away   Don’t cry to me you’re sorry  It’s too late for that  When did you ever listen  You walked all over me  Don’t think my heart is yours  There’s nothing left to give  You tore it all to pieces  Live with what you give  You’ve won   You’ve pushed me away  You want it all  All to be your way  Is it too late  You made the mistakes  Live to face the day  You pushed me  Now I’ve walked away   What else did you expect  Someone to kiss your a$$  My heart locked inside  Guarded by it’s scars  You’ve won &nbsp; Copyright 2003, all rights reserved. &nbsp; &nbsp; I just kill myself when I read stuff like that.&nbsp; That was almost a year before our divorce was filed.&nbsp; Heck, the marriage was over before this was ever written.&nbsp; I guess I just thought I had to try to make it work, for the kids or it was the right thing to do.&nbsp; It only made things worse and better yet, he found wonderful ways in which to blame me...because of course, he couldn't be any bit to blame for the collapse of our marriage.&nbsp; Now I'm being sarcastic...again, attitude (and a bad one).
