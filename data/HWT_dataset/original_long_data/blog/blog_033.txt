Well i'm eating my last piece of cheesecake which i was saving for my friend alexandra...but she hasnt been coming by to pick it up....its been 5 days!! so....i decided to eat it ~_~ yes yes i kno...i'm a horrid friend..but it was sooo tempting. I'll just have to buy her a fresher piece. I'm such a lazy bastard as well...i can't seem to leave my house...i'm even dressed...i was gonna do some museum work...but halfway i decided to lie down...and then it was too late...i got lazy again. Tomorrow i really have to put myself together. Well on a good note....strawberries are very good
