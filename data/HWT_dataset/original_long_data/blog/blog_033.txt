8 treatments finised. Now we have long weekend ahead of us. Long and slow and boring because everybody is leaving ronald mcdonald house. I feel like we'll be the only family staying there for this 3 day weekend :( it sucks to live so far from ca. ** during the next week dr gajjar is out of office. I got reginas next week scedule. Next week sucks. All her apointments are noon ones. I'm 100% sure its because dr gajjar is out of office and not pushing radiation guys to take regina in early. I can handle this one week. I just feel sad for regina because some days she'll get her first meal around 4-5 pm. Which is really bad because she is allready loosing weight and i don't want her to loose more. She is doing reat . Bad thing is her taste has changed ( foods) and her apetite is down.
