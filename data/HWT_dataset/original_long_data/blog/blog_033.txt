8 Treatments finised. Now we have long weekend ahead of us. LONG and slow and boring because everybody is leaving Ronald McDonald house. I feel like we'll be the only family staying there for this 3 day weekend :( It sucks to live so far from CA.  ** During the next week Dr Gajjar is out of office.  I got Reginas next week scedule. Next week sucks. ALl her apointments are NOON  ones. I'm 100% sure its because Dr Gajjar is out of office and not pushing radiation guys to take Regina in Early. I can  handle this one week. I just feel sad for regina because some days she'll get her first meal around 4-5 pm. Which is really bad  because she is  allready loosing weight and I don't want her to loose more.   She is doing reat  .  Bad thing is Her taste has changed ( foods) and her apetite is down.
