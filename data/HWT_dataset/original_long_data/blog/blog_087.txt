That's what they call it here.  I guess cause it's right on the border of the three states.  It's not so bad, but it's freakin'* hot!!!!  I'm trying to stay inside as much as possible, although Andrew made me jog yesterday.  Blech!  I did try hard not to wimp out, but by the end, I was mostly walking cause I was getting a major headache.    I'm back in the coffee shop again.  Maybe I oughta put in an application or something, since I'm here so much.  :)  It's really funny listening to people come in and ask for stuff, and be totally confused about espresso drinks (what is the difference between a cappucino and a latte?  Do you know?  I do, but most people don't).  It's cute.  I'm not making fun of the espresso-challenged.  You'll learn.  But stop drinking those horrible frozen things with tons of whipped cream, for Yemaya's sake!  (See.  I know other names of gods than what I listed earlier!!) (Unless of course you're skinny as a rail.  Then have two of them, and eat a sandwich, too.  You can afford the calories).    I'm trying really hard to figure out how to word my dissertation introduction so that I am making my argument clear.  I think I might have something right now that will do it-- it's been sorta vague so far, but I got an idea while I was half-napping a little bit ago.  So this is just a short 'I'm still here' kind of post. I answered some questions and issues people raised in the comments to the bee post (which some of you really liked!  I'm happy!  I like getting comments!!)    Now I need to get to writin' 'bout witches.  :)   *for adventures in 'spell check'-- it wants to change 'freakin'' to foreskin.  Funny suggestion, that.  :)
