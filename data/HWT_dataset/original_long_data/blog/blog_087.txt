That's what they call it here. I guess cause it's right on the border of the three states. It's not so bad, but it's freakin'* hot!!!! i'm trying to stay inside as much as possible, although andrew made me jog yesterday. Blech! i did try hard not to wimp out, but by the end, i was mostly walking cause i was getting a major headache. I'm back in the coffee shop again. Maybe i oughta put in an application or something, since i'm here so much. :) it's really funny listening to people come in and ask for stuff, and be totally confused about espresso drinks (what is the difference between a cappucino and a latte? do you know? i do, but most people don't). It's cute. I'm not making fun of the espresso-challenged. You'll learn. But stop drinking those horrible frozen things with tons of whipped cream, for yemaya's sake! (see. I know other names of gods than what i listed earlier!!) (unless of course you're skinny as a rail. Then have two of them, and eat a sandwich, too. You can afford the calories). I'm trying really hard to figure out how to word my dissertation introduction so that i am making my argument clear. I think i might have something right now that will do it-- it's been sorta vague so far, but i got an idea while i was half-napping a little bit ago. So this is just a short 'i'm still here' kind of post. I answered some questions and issues people raised in the comments to the bee post (which some of you really liked! i'm happy! i like getting comments!!) now i need to get to writin' 'bout witches. :) *for adventures in 'spell check'-- it wants to change 'freakin'' to foreskin. Funny suggestion, that. :)
