People reading the knight ridder report about george w. Bush's visit to concordia university in wisconsin were informed that there was 'no hint of protest.' by coming to concordia, a conservative campus and the largest lutheran university in north america, bush all but guaranteed a warm reception. There was no hint of protest during the ceremony, and some audience members shouted, 'we love you, w,' when he took the stage. Actually, there was a protest during the ceremony. I attended it. We must have been missed by the eye of the reporter because we weren't allowed anywhere near bush's venue. Looks like my article about free speech zones has some new material. The new york times issued this correction: an article on saturday about remarks by president bush at a commencement address at concordia university in mequon, wis., referred imprecisely to protests against his policies. While no protesters were at the actual ceremony, the secret service did allow them several blocks away.
