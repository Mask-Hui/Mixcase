Just a quickie today folks! had serious lack of sleep last night. The neighbours next door (neighbours generally next door, but i was attempting to differentiate between neighbours as in 'who is my neighbour?', and what we generally think of as a neighbour today) had as massive as party. Well it was not so bad on the music front as the bass boom boom boom only went until about 12:00, but it was the yelling and shrieking that was really annoying. The last thing i remember was at 5:20 in the morning a young guy shouting 'help help im stuck in the fu***** window, someone get me out!' well needless to say, i ignored his cries for help, although i thought of many potential ways i could in fact help him. Most of these methods involved pointy sticks, steel-capped boots, fire or directed pressurised water. Anyway that's as maybe. I was consequently late for work, as i slept in, and i think people found me rather grouchy during the day. I really didn't treat people nicely today, and found myself snapping at my family where normally i would have been fine. Hmm, more sanctification to take place methinks.
