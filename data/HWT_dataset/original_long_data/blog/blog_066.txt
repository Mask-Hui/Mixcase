Marten started the blog, but only officially. It was my idea, and was actually started while i was over at his house. I'm as much responsible for having started it as he is. Also, this all comes back to what i said at the socrates cafe about how individuals are defined by society and to deny that society is to deny a part of yourself. Therefore, 'gossip' as you call it is actually and important form of self-examination, studying onesself by ones relationships with others. Viewed in this light, it's an incredibly high brow form of communication, moreso than you're piddly rants. And don't go saying it's 'more of a musical scene', and yes, there most likely will be a second attack at some point. Sqee!
