Just got back from okla. It's weird, like two different worlds going back and forth. They will never merge. They will never connect in any way. ..still trying to decide as to whether that's a good or bad thing. Today--boring at first. I'd like to take this opportunity to point out an annoyance: you hit on me. You make fun of me. You tell my boyfriend you liked me. You hit on all my friends [which disgusts them.] --the list goes on and on-- that had been bugging me all day, so i'm glad it's out of my system. Then the fun began: thank you, baby. T'was amazing . Good evening.
