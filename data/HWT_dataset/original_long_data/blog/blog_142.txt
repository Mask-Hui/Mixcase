Today I went to Kendyls cheer thing and when I asked how much I was going to get paid the Cheer director said she wouldnt pay me....this pissed me off...so Iam not helping any more. But anyways...I took Kendyl to cheer practice and then picked her up at 8 pm.     Ryan had called me and wanted me to play pool with him and Tony. So I asked my mom and she said NO! Then I finally got a yes. I hadnt seen Ryan in forever! (3 days) and I missed him. So I didnt play pool but they did. I watched Ryan win and loose. Mostly win though. hehe.     I started to get sick from all the smoke and with Ryans last dollar he bought me a drink...awee.....he is so sweet!    Then Ryan went with me to get gas in my car. We went for a 'lil make out session too. hehe. Not for long like 5 min. I had to go I was in a rush. Then I dropped Ryan back off with Tony. As I drove off I told Ryan I loved him and he said I love you to. As I drove off I heard a girl say Aweee.... it made me smile.     You know Iam so lucky to have a boyfriend as great as Ryan. He is the best thing that has happend to me. I love him sooo much!     g'night!
