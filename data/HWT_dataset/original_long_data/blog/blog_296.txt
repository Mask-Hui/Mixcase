Hum, i'm thinking i'm overbudget on my computer somewhere and thus will not have enough for the three monitors i was going to get. We shall see how much i actually make eh? but if i don't have enough, i guess i'll just save my money for a while, after all, with everything else it's got i think i can be satisfied with only one monitor... Or maybe two. Tomorrow i'm going to be spending a hefty amount of money... Well not spending all of it, but getting it out. First is $104 for saturday and gifts. I'm bringing $40 for movies and food, and $5 to give sarah to turn in for the beach trip in two weeks (which i mentioned to my mom and she didn't seem to have a problem with), $4 for an all day bus ticket for sarah, and then another odd amount for the gifts i am getting her for our anniversary last month. Armaan is going to be back by saturday so it's possible he might go see the movie (the village) with us or something, that'd be cool. Maybe i can get him to pick me and sarah up, though it'd be quite a drive... Hum. On top of the money for saturday, i'm also getting some pictures developed and buying a few more computer things (drives, sound card, video card, and a desk). After that i may well be almost done with the whole computer thing, just getting speakers and then taking a break to see if i'll have enough for monitors or not... Yes it's fun. The first week of school i am planning on getting the stupid proof of enrollment form so i can get my permit, and then i probably won't keep the permit for he full time you're 'supposed' to have it, just until i'm a pretty good driver and stuff... I cannot wait. That's why i should save the extra ~$1000 that i would have left over if i don't worry about the monitors...
