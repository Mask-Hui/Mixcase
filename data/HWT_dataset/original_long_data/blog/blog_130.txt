Last night was the worst. I threw away the sweater i was knitting. I only had about 14 inches. I lost probably $10 worth of yarn (it's $8 a skein). But it had too many stitches by the time i got to the arm holes and the mohair was knotting itself together as i knitted, so frogging (ripping out rows) didn't work well. The yarn broke a lot. I didn't even swear, which is unusual for me. I just morosely ripped and listened to season two of sex and the city (way to go, library!). And then i got sick of it and threw it away. I suppose i could say i learned a lot while trying to do this sweater. I learned a new stitch and the value of using two different sized needles at once. I learned that maybe i should count my stitches more often. I learned how to not split the yarn (which was my problem, i think - i was sometimes doing two stitches in one because the yarn looked like it was two stitches). So i tried to find another project but i just kept ripping it out. I really want to make that sweater. I'm disappointed in myself. I'm going to find that yarn store in westport over lunch and tell my sad story and hopefully get some inspiration. I'm reading the urban knitter, which is okay. The pictures are not anywhere near the instructions for the projects and the stories about the projects aren't all that interesting. But i do enjoy learning about the construction of the garments. I just...i feel kind of lost. Okay. Forget this. I'm going to make that sleeveless top i linked to a few weeks back. I'll pick up some yarn at lunch. Anything to keep me from finishing those quilts.
