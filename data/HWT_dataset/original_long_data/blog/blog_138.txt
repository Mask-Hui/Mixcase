Cleaning off my deaktop - i started an it log, but that is pretty much a blog is for, eh? 6-2-04 leah had received an unusual email yesterday, and wasn’t sure what it was. After i looked at it, i determined that i didn’t have the time to study what it was, so i told her to delete it, which she did. Today leah calls me over, and the same email had been resent to her. I asked her to forward it to me, and when i received it in my mailbox, i noticed that the file extension didn’t pass the sniff test. When i tried to save it to my desktop, the file name was like “document_leah.txt .exe”. Notice all the spaces between the two file extensions. Now knowing that this was most likely a virus, i went ahead and saved it to my desktop to test avg, and it didn’t skip a beat. Avg cried when i saved it to the desktop, then it cried when i moved it to the recycle bin, and then avg was crying when i wanted to empty the recycle bin. After doing that, i ran avg and scanned the hd, and it was on the hd somewhere. Avg said the infection was healed. I will have leah scan her hd at lunch time, but it shouldn’t be there because she did not d/l it from the webserver. *** did full scan at lunch, virus was removed. 6-9-04 security windows updated – d/l’ed and installed on my comp as well as leah’s, jessica’s new and sue’s. Will take jessica’s old offline today. Attempting to put adobe on server to share. Tried to install photoshop onto server in the esp folder. Attempt failed. Installed it on jessica’s and sue’s. Noticed that server required a windows update, and did so.
