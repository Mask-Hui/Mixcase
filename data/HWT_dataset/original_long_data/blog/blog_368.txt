Two problems with the scenario outlined in my previous post: 1. True, bush is stimulating the economy, but in the wrong way. Urllink robert rubin told npr's marketplace today that bush could have achieved the same stimulus effect without the long term debt hangover by enacting different tax cuts, temporary tax cuts that would benefit low and middle income persons. Ah, robert rubin. The sound of his name is music to our ears. Quick: name one bush administration cabinet official on the domestic side with rubin's gravitas. Still thinking? it'll come to you... 2. We can't give the republicans control only in wartime because they've ingeniously concocted an endless, global 'war on terrorism.' there will be no v-j day in this war; hence no date to show them the door. How conveeeeenient, we says.
