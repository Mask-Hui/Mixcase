today was the last day of school for the year, and my finals for the day were quite easy. first semester i really applied myself and actually enjoyed the fruits of my effort. second semester i sort of slacked off, which is still better than the normal person's best efforts, but i did have a lot more fun outside of school. which semester really had the most impact on me? probably the second. you might sit and wonder why, but so many great things happened from january to now. some i've probably talked about, some i know i haven't. i got a job, i'm starting to save up so i can get a car (an suv, so i can actually fit into it), and too many other things to list. my grades may not be as good as they were first semester, but you know what? that's fine by me. one who lives a good life does not always graduate first in his class, nor does he often get recognized for his accomplishments, be they tangible or not. so many great things cannot be seen by anyone unless they truly know and understand you. truly happy people are the ones that have, side-by-side, a person who be with them to see their triumphs, as well as the inevitable defeats. unhappy people are those who have to live in a shell, hiding everything that happens to them, and not having anybody to share with their successes. the combination of the negative feelings of these unrecognized successes and uncomforted defeats is the telltale equation of an unhappy person. thank god (irony?) i realized this and now know what my purpose in life is, whether you do or not.
