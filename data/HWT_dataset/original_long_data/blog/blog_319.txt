Stolen playgrounds tiger woods' homeland stretches out across my field of vision. I tell the woman to my right that 33% of all the water in jacksonville must go to feed these lawns; a number pulled out of my ass, but possibly true. Golfers spot the landscape like cat shit in litter. I am thinking of the house off stockton where i spent yesterday, crackheads bumming my clove cigarettes. I am thinking of the neighborhood i wasn't supposed to walk in after dark and the kids i never saw playing outside. The wind is blowing and inside the meeting space, people vend their wares to investment bankers and 5th hole wives. I stub out my smoke and steal a pack of matches from the shiny, clean ashtray.
