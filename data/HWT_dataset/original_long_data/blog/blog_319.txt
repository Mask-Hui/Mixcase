Stolen Playgrounds   Tiger Woods' homeland stretches out across my field of vision.  I tell the woman to my right that 33% of all the water in Jacksonville must go to feed these lawns; a number pulled out of my ass, but possibly true.  Golfers spot the landscape like cat shit in litter.  I am thinking of the house off Stockton where I spent yesterday, crackheads bumming my clove cigarettes.  I am thinking of the neighborhood I wasn't supposed to walk in after dark and the kids I never saw playing outside.  The wind is blowing and inside the meeting space, people vend their wares to investment bankers and 5th hole wives.  I stub out my smoke and steal a pack of matches from the shiny, clean ashtray.
