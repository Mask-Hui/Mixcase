'Goes out to cruise and to meet his connection He never scores he just get's an infection Dreams of a place with a better selection Still it takes him all day just to get an erection'  Hmm i'm bored, been doing stupid things all day, amusing myself at least, i'm waiting for 53 minutes to go pick up my sister Lucille and her best friend Mollie so i won't be so bored. Mum made Mollie a huge birthday cake today with her name on it and all because on Lucy's birthday Lucy complained about the cake (which had her name written on it) saying that the Y was fucked or something, and then Mollie said 'At least you got a birthday cake, I don't even get a cake, let alone a cake with my name on it'. So mum made her a cake with a big HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOLLIE on it. It's a bigger cake than I ever got, and mum never made ME a cake with my name on it! Oh well anyway I bought Mollie a present today. Lucy bought her a Blink-182 cd and some smarties but then I got hungry and ate her smarties and i was gonna replace them but i DIDN'T! Oh shite I talk some boring sheeatttt. Hmm I might go eat the smarties mum bought for Mollie now.. mmmmmmmmmm... I'll replace them, they're already opened anyway what's the difference!!!!  *Her younger sister had a blister where I kissed her, on her thigh*
