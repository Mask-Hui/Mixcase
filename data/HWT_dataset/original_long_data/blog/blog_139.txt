I did it! i got my hair cut short. It's above my shoulders but below my chin. Cute - i think. It seems to have given me a very slight face lift. It's different! will take some getting used to, but i'm happy with it. Now i just need to update my makeup. Yes, i did it. I always said that i wouldn't - but i did. I got the thirty-something haircut. Who was i trying to kid? i drive a mini van and answer to 'mom' more often than i do to 'jan'. It was time. Actually, it was about three years overdue. Also, after seeing our vacation video...i might just throw out those camouflage pants.
