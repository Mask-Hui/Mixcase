I did it!  I got my hair cut short.  It's above my shoulders but below my chin.  Cute - I think.  It seems to have given me a very slight face lift.  It's different!  Will take some getting used to, but I'm happy with it.  Now I just need to update my makeup.    Yes, I did it.  I always said that I wouldn't - But I did.  I got the thirty-something haircut.  Who was I trying to kid?  I drive a mini van and answer to 'Mom' more often than I do to 'Jan'. It was time.  Actually, It was about three years overdue.    Also, after seeing our vacation video...I might just throw out those camouflage pants.
