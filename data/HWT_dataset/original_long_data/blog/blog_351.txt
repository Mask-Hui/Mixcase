It's funny how girls use their hair as an emotional outlet. While i can't speak for all girls, it is definitely true of me. Everytime something big happens in my life, i tend to do something equally drastic to my hair. Last year, when i returned from shanghai and was confronted by the formidable prospect of finding a job, i suddenly woke up one morning and decided to chop off my beloved tresses. Half a year later, as soon as my first relationship ended, i violated one of my biggest credos of life and did the unthinkable. What am i talking about? bangs! talk about sprinkling salt on an open wound. So today, after a weekend of...let's just say deviant/miscreant behavior, i woke up and thought, hm, i'm sick of black hair, and sure enough, after a brief visit with my flamin' hairstylist (remember jay-cee? 'and what can i do for you today, love?'), i am now sporting a reddish-purplish-brownish crown. Coincidence? i think not.
