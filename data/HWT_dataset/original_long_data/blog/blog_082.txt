Today we threw a sursrise retirement party for the teacher mr smith... I think he liked it! we had cake adn doritos and coke and it was good! math was soooooooo friggin' boring today! we're doing review for the exam.... And we weren't allowed to talk. I got a 71% on a math test just because i didn't have time to finish it... During all that review i figured out that if it had just been out of the part i finished i would've gotten an 89%!! well that's good to know. And yet completely useless. Tanya got a picture of oscar wilde at sugar mountain today! i love that place... I could live there... The pic is very nice... I love his hat. It's too bad he was homosexual... Heehee........
