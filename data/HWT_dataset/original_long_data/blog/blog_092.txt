for enjoyment ... this was posted on craig's list LA about radiohead shows, please note the bolded parts:  i bought two tickets for radiohead and am really hoping to find a nice girl to go with.  i really prefer asian girls  but would be open to anything if you were  really cute, and thin  please. i'm 27 and really love music, will probably go a bit crazy at the concert.i hope to find someone to be romantic with after the show so no girls with boyfriends/ husbands. gotta send me a pic, if you don't, sorry.    blasting on the stereo:  monaco - blue ... good stuff man :) side project of new order with peter hook
