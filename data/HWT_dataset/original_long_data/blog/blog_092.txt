For enjoyment ... This was posted on craig's list la about radiohead shows, please note the bolded parts: i bought two tickets for radiohead and am really hoping to find a nice girl to go with. I really prefer asian girls but would be open to anything if you were really cute, and thin please. I'm 27 and really love music, will probably go a bit crazy at the concert.i hope to find someone to be romantic with after the show so no girls with boyfriends/ husbands. Gotta send me a pic, if you don't, sorry. Blasting on the stereo: monaco - blue ... Good stuff man :) side project of new order with peter hook
