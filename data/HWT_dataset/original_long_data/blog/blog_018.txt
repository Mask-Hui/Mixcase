Doesn't Jamee L. Amundson MS MD sound nice? I think so. I think it is time that I suck it up, go to med school and show these morons how it is done. Here is the latest debacle RE: my broken arm.  So I broke my arm in Wayne, NE which is two and a half hours from Lincoln. At the Wayne Medical Clinic, I saw my x-rays and with my extensive knowledge of anatomy and physiology (of animals and the peeps), I identified the nice clean break in my ulna. Dr. in Wayne put a cast on my arm, said 'Two weeks in this long arm cast, four weeks in the short arm cast'. Ok, that's fine. So Monday, I go to the new Dr. in Lincoln, who I really don't like. I explain everything to her (about my broken   ULNA  ) and she proceeds to call the Wayne Medical Clinic for my records. Medical records arrive via advances in technology called a fax machine, and the Dr. comes in and says 'It's actually your radius that is broken'. Uhhhh no, I'm sorry, that is not correct. So I argue with her about it and she won't listen to me. Now, I realize that a great majority of the time that I am an idiot, but not that day. I was on that day. So, I leave that clinic ticked off because she says I have to be in the long arm cast for longer because she thinks I have a broken radius.  Lets take a moment to have an anatomy lesson and perhaps both Drs. could read this, evidently you both need to brush up on your anatomy of the human body. The ULNA is the smaller of the two arm bones and it runs on your the pinky finger side of your hand. The RADIUS is the bigger of the two arm bones and runs up the thumb side of your hand. Now granted, these two bones do cross at your elbow when you twist your forearm, but that does not change their location in relationship to the fingers on your hand. When the ULNA is broken, patients will pass out (or likely barf in radiology) when you ask them to rotate their arm at the elbow. If the RADIUS is broken, the thumb will likely not work and making a fist is much more difficult. Additionally, if you feel a bump (or bone 'step-off' as we professionals like to call it) on the pinky finger side of the arm, that is the ULNA.  With that said, I called the Wayne Medical Clinic to have my original films sent to Lincoln. The radiologist called me back to remind me that the films need to be sent back to them. I said that was fine and told her of the 'mix-up' in my records and the good doc here in Lincoln did not believe me. She pulled out my x-rays and said 'Why yes, that definitely is your ULNA that is broken'. Why thank you, I now feel vindicated. I can't wait to have a consult with the Dr. here in Lincoln. She is going to get a nice suuuprise. Maybe this time she'll be a little nicer to me.
