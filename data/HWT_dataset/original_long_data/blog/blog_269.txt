Cisv-kids&nbsp; urllink urllink children's international summer villages (cisv) is a unique youth exchange organization cisv evolved from a firm conviction that lasting peace is possible if individuals and groups can learn to live together as friends. For cisv, the key to making this vision a reality, was to start working with children and youth. Programmes were developed which offered young people opportunities to meet their peers from other countries and to form intercultural friendships. Locally, programmes give people the chance to learn about the cultures in their own communities and explore important themes related to peace and understanding. (courtesty of urllink www.cisv.org )
