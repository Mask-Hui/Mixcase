I cannot believe how many people have never read a word of Tolkien.  After three films, countless marketing blitzes, and over twenty Academy Awards... Most people have never read the books.  Why is this true?  It might be because Tolkien is a dry read.  Well I say this.  Pick up ONE of the three Lord of the Rings books, Return of the King, and read ONE section.  The Battle of the Pelennor Fields.  Then tell me Tolkien is dry.  You'll appreciate that attention to detail when he's describing the charge of the Rohirrim before the walls of Minas Tirith.  And if you want a short sample of Tolkien's brilliance?  Here is a poem from The Fellowship of the Ring, entitled The Riddle of Strider...   All that is gold does not glitter, Not all those who wander are lost; The old that is strong does not wither, Deep roots are not reached by the frost. From the ashes a fire shall be woken, Alight from the shadows shall spring; Renewed shall be blade that was broken: The crownless again shall be king.  --J.R.R. Tolkien   Tell me that doesn't move you.  Tell me that is a bad poem not worth the paper it is written on.  Simple, short, and beautiful.  Inspiring even.  In case you missed it, here it is again, this time in Sindarin Elvish...    Pân i valt law thilia, Law pain i reviar mistar aen; Iaur i vell law thinnatha, Law thynd dyfn na-niss rathar aen. O lith naur echuiathar aen, Calad od dúath thuiatha; Adamminen i vagol vreithannen, Pen-thôl ad echannen i aran.  --J.R.R. Tolkien    Tolkien was a brilliant linguist as well.  He invented not one, but two languages: Quenya and Sindarin.  And pieces of several more, including Black Speech.  Read Tolkien, you'll thank me for it.
