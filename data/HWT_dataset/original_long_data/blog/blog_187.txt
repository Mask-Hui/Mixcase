The mayor of Hiroshima has taken the Administration to task for ramping up work on 'micro-nukes,' low-yield devices that could be used to neutralize high-value targets (like hardened WMD sites).  First, why does being mayor of Hiroshima make one an expert on American defense policy or our strategic posture.  Second, although the  urlLink CBC  does not mention it, I hope the mayor also took the time to condemn the war of aggression that Japan launched that led to the nuking of Hiroshima, the mass atrocities that Japan committed during that WW2 (during the Rape of Nanking, for example, 300,000 Chinese civilians were butchered by Japanese troops, far more than were killed in the two a-bombings), condemned the ongoing trend in Japan to downplay their role in WW2 and emphasize the a-bombings in a context free manner and, finally, suggested other means of destroying the kinds of targets that micro-nukes would be used against that would be equally effective.  But, I kind of doubt that he did any of these.
