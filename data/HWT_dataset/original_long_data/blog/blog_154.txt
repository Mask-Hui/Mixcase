Right now I'm left wondering why is it that I'm supposed to think for everybody else? Why is it, that when I make a tiny mistake, or not even a mistake actually, maybe just I'm a little less careful, I don't spell everything out 100% and repeat and repeat and repeat all over again... Why is it that I feel like the world is crumbling down after that? Why is that if a person receives a paper that she doesn't know what to do with, she doesn't start wondering that if she didn't request it, maybe someone else did? I can sit here and sigh as much as I want to, but the truth is, I sent out requests for submitting IT training tenders 6 weeks ago. The date for submitting the tenders was 5 weeks ago, and today I find out that the one tender I received by e-mail wasn't actually the only one after all... there was another one that the personnel manager has graciously sat on until this very moment, I only found out about it from a third party. What else is there to do really, but sigh...
