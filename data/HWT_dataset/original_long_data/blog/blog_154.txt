Right now i'm left wondering why is it that i'm supposed to think for everybody else? why is it, that when i make a tiny mistake, or not even a mistake actually, maybe just i'm a little less careful, i don't spell everything out 100% and repeat and repeat and repeat all over again... Why is it that i feel like the world is crumbling down after that? why is that if a person receives a paper that she doesn't know what to do with, she doesn't start wondering that if she didn't request it, maybe someone else did? i can sit here and sigh as much as i want to, but the truth is, i sent out requests for submitting it training tenders 6 weeks ago. The date for submitting the tenders was 5 weeks ago, and today i find out that the one tender i received by e-mail wasn't actually the only one after all... There was another one that the personnel manager has graciously sat on until this very moment, i only found out about it from a third party. What else is there to do really, but sigh...
