Goddamn swedes. I hate van nistelrooy even more now. @$@%$#^ $&%^*&% so angry! does anyone notice how when we break up we have urges to give back everything that was given to us by our exes? funny how that goes isn't it? technically we should be basking with the memories that we once had. But instead, we just wanna expunge everything that once had to do with that person. So we do get rid of everything a) we give them back everything they've given us, b) if they don't accept it, we chuck it out c) we throw everything in a box and hide it deep in our storerooms or under our beds. But once the anger has subsided and once the feelings have found a steady flux, we finally realize how much emotional baggage all those things had in them. We get nostalgic over thinking about them. We lurk in the past and re-live the happy times. We wish we had everything in our hands again. And then, there are times you just never ever wanna see that particular item ever again. Not because it'd make you sad; but just because it'd make you sick and think about the relationship which you once had which was built on a platform of lies. Can we throw out a rosary? argh.
