Unfulfilled. My very best friend told me tonight 'you're the most social person i've ever known, yet you're the loneliest.' she's right. I hate it. I absolutely hate it. My mom told me a few days ago 'i know sometimes you feel alone, so so alone. But you never are. I am always here. Always.' she's right. I'm lucky. I'm absolutely lucky. Less is more. That's how the saying goes. I disagree. More is more. And i wan't more. Tonight i pretended that i fell asleep in my true love's arms. Fast asleep. The kind of comfortable deep sleep you can only achieve in the presence of absolute peace. I'm oh so ready to be fulfilled. Bring it.
