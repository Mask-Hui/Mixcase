What did i do today?? hmmm.... Oh, okay my mother got me up around noon, and sent me to pick up some lunch. After we ate, i took my dad's sandwich to him at his office, where he was showing one of the oral surgeon's sons how to cast a crown (fun). Then, (after arguing with my mother) i helped clean house. This evening, they went to a wedding, in which both the bride and groom have down syndrome. You may have seen the bride (wendy) working at chick-fil-a. While they are at that, i stayed at home and did nothing (read: wrote blog entry). Actually, i did make myself supper, which consisted of: wheat crackers, cheese, peanut butter, and sour cream and onion potato chips. At one point, i put all four together and dipped it in some ranch dressing i found. To answer the obvious question, it tasted like a wheat cracker, cheese, peanut butter, and sour cream and onion potato chips dipped in ranch. Later this evening there is a free concert at wolf pen amphitheater, which i might or might not go to. Some people will be there that i know, and my parents might go if they get back in time. Well, that's not until later so i won't worry about it.
