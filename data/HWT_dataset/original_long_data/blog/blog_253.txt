What DID I do today?? hmmm.... oh, okay My mother got me up around noon, and sent me to pick up some lunch. After we ate, I took my dad's sandwich to him at his office, where he was showing one of the oral surgeon's sons how to cast a crown (fun). Then, (after arguing with my mother) I helped clean house. This evening, they went to a wedding, in which both the bride and groom have Down syndrome. You may have seen the bride (Wendy) working at Chick-fil-a. While they are at that, I stayed at home and did nothing (read: wrote blog entry). Actually, I did make myself supper, which consisted of: wheat crackers, cheese, peanut butter, and sour cream and onion potato chips. At one point, I put all four together and dipped it in some ranch dressing I found. To answer the obvious question, it tasted like a wheat cracker, cheese, peanut butter, and sour cream and onion potato chips dipped in ranch. Later this evening there is a free concert at Wolf Pen Amphitheater, which I might or might not go to. Some people will be there that I know, and my parents might go if they get back in time. Well, that's not until later so I won't worry about it.
