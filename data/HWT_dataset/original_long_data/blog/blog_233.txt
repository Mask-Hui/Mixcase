So i'm feeling very ugly today. Like, i feel like i should do the world a favor and walk around with a bag over my head. Or a surgical mask, dark glasses and big hat a la michael jackson. Butyeah. Every time i looked in a mirror today i was like: damn! i'm ugly! i haven't felt like this/thought this way in a while, and it's kinda amusing me. I mean, i'm sure if it continues, it'll cease to be amusing. But right now when i'm looking in a mirror and thinking 'holy shit who is that freaking ugly girl?!' i have to laugh. Anyway. So i decided that i had to convince myself that i'm not really ugly and looking at the people at urllink mingers.com really helped. I don't do mingers.
