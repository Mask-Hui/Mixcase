so i'm feeling very ugly today.  like, i feel like i should do the world a favor and walk around with a bag over my head.  or a surgical mask, dark glasses and big hat a la michael jackson.  butyeah.  every time i looked in a mirror today i was like: Damn!  I'm ugly!  I haven't felt like this/thought this way in a while, and it's kinda amusing me.  i mean, i'm sure if it continues, it'll cease to be amusing.  but right now when i'm looking in a mirror and thinking 'holy shit who is that freaking ugly girl?!' i have to laugh.  anyway.  so i decided that i had to convince myself that i'm not really ugly and looking at the people at  urlLink mingers.com  really helped.  i don't do mingers.
