My house smells. Really bad. Its disgusting. Our kitchen floor is like a linoleum lined, unwashed, vagina. I went to the st. Louis film festival this weekend. It was pretty good. I saw a lot of really bad films and 3 good ones. Thats it. I saw three films that i thought were worth driving two hours for. But i guess three films is not bad. I was miserable all weekend though on account of my cheek. I don't think i talked about this yet, but i chewed off my inner cheek. I know it sounds gross, but actually its really gross. So i went to get my cavities filled on wednesday and i was really nervous it was going to hurt. Luckily it didn't hurt at all. And afterwards they told me i would be fine. But that i shouldn't eat for a couple of hours because i could hurt myself. So i didn't. And then 45 minutes later i was famished so i ate a turkey sandwhich and my world fell apart. I chewed my inner cheek off. Not completely off but i bit down on it hard like three times. Hard like i was trying to consume it. Because i couldn't feel my cheek i could only tell i was eating it by the difference in texture between a turkey sandwhich and a cheek. (cheek is tougher to chew and tastes more like escargot) so like i said. I didn't hurt at the time, but now i feels like someone bit through my cheek. Which is true someone did bite through my cheek. Me. So now i can't eat any foods which requires chewing. I have to survive on a diet of soup and milkshakes. And while milkshakes for every meal is quite nice, it is not as satisfying as a hamburger. So yeah all weekend i felt like shit. Except for when i was drinking milkshakes.
