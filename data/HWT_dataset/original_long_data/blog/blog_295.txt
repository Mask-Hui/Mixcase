my house smells.  really bad.  its disgusting.  our kitchen floor is like a linoleum lined, unwashed, vagina.    i went to the st. louis film festival this weekend.  it was pretty good.  i saw a lot of really bad films and 3 good ones.  thats it.  i saw three films that i thought were worth driving two hours for.  but i guess three films is not bad.    i was miserable all weekend though on account of my cheek.  i don't think i talked about this yet, but i chewed off my inner cheek.  i know it sounds gross, but actually its really gross.  so i went to get my cavities filled on wednesday and i was really nervous it was going to hurt.  luckily it didn't hurt at all.  and afterwards they told me i would be fine.  but that i shouldn't eat for a couple of hours because i could hurt myself.  so i didn't.  and then 45 minutes later i was famished so i ate a turkey sandwhich and my world fell apart.  i chewed my inner cheek off.  not completely off but i bit down on it hard like three times.  hard like i was trying to consume it.  because i couldn't feel my cheek i could only tell i was eating it by the difference in texture between a turkey sandwhich and a cheek.  (cheek is tougher to chew and tastes more like escargot) so like i said.  i didn't hurt at the time, but now i feels like someone bit through my cheek.  which is true someone did bite through my cheek.  me.  so now i can't eat any foods which requires chewing. i have to survive on a diet of soup and milkshakes.  and while milkshakes for every meal is quite nice, it is not as satisfying as a hamburger.  so yeah all weekend i felt like shit.  except for when i was drinking milkshakes.
