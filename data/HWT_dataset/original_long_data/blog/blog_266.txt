I'm getting into this syndication shit... However i really have no god damn clue about what is going on. I've managed to register at urllink http://www.bloglines.com which is a web-based aggregator to track rss and atom feeds from the internet. You can get programs that download rss and atom feeds, like urllink this one onto your pc, and it saves you from having to surf to the site every day, you can just read it from the program. [ wonder if that still makes the hit counter ding? ] next thing i'm trying to do is to publish 'headlines' from some of these sites and display them somewhere on this cluttered mess. For now, bloglines allows me to publish the rss/atom feeds i'm subscribed to on the site, and thus allow everyone to see what i'm reading. Why that would intrest anyone, i don't know... But hey, there's my list. Check out these links for more information: urllink bloglines - web based rss program urllink sharing your site using rss urllink amphetadesk - program to download rss feeds anyway, i'm out. Post comments if you know anything about this shit, and have something to say about it. Let me know if you already use rss aggrewhatevers and if you've registered to fish, inc. ~out~ syndicate: reruns; seinfield; when's the dvds coming?
