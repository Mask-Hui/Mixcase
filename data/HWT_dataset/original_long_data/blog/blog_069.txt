Tears drying up At the corner of my sight Reminiscing the moment Mourning with all my might  Can I not contain The emptiess that I feel? Still I imagine If these things are real  Rainbows of wishes I keep on counting Take it from my heart The melodies I sing  Have angels waken up To make me see the reality? Or the cupids mistake me For someone who’s more worthy  Pictures I keep on holding Letters I keep on reading Moments in my mind still lingering Thru it all it’s him I keep on loving  To me he has left nothing But plain old me instead Imbude in me was all the hurt All the blame and the things he said  This foolishness I’ve been When will it have to end Or for lifetimes I may have foreseen When will I stop to pretend  Whatever life can bring me in time I may have ran out of my rhyme But still I believe that it’s you and me Though ever after’s are not for us to see
