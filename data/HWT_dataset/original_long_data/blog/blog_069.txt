Goodwill hunting -matt damon, ben affleck (the young guys co wrote the movie, and i think this was when they both won for best script??, anyways this movie started it all for these guys) hello she, best regards to you and your family. Anyways (fyi) chingay and company decided that there is a game in the golden sushi posting wherein -you start your post with a movie title that starts with the last letter of the movie last posted, hence scorpion kin (g) - (g)oodwill hunting. We had a birthday party for ching. I can't wait to see the pictures posted. I'd say ric is not done steam vacuuming our house. That probably is it for this year, as we prepare for our trip to the phil. Of course jen's birthday is coming up, we would probably much rather have that in the restaurant.
