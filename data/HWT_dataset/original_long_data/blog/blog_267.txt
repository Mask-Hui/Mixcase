There's really no mercy in the word mercenary, is there?   urlLink Look at what the new nazi party is up to now .  What are we allowing to happen?  Can we honestly condemn the Germans for not seeing what was going on?  Hopefully we can, and we'll change this before we are too deep in the shit. The domestic problems of this country should be handled within this country.  We can't bully the world into solving our problems.  Bush really is scaring me.  Who is responsible for keeping his actions under control... us?  Shit... how do we do that?  It seems we've given him a free four year pass to play our system for everything he wants out of it.  He's a crazy man.  How do we impeach him before he does too much damage?
