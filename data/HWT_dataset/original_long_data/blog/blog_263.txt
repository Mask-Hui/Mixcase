This morning I woke up extremely fatigued, dizzy, nauseated and my leg, feet and back muscles ached. Two things went through my head...Which couldn't possiblely be. It wasn't. I gather from my ailments, that I'm most likely suffering from heat exhaustion. The temperatures here have been wretchedly hot! Midafternoon yesterday, it reached a scorching 101 degrees. But as these west coast people are fond of saying 'It's a  dry  heat.' Anyhow, I spent most of the day outdoors (duh!), visiting nurseries and working in the garden. While pruning some shrubs, I ran into several black widows. I hate spiders, especially ugly ones. I think I got a little too happy with the insecticide. Hmmm, so it may be a combination of the heat and insecticide fumes that's making me sick. So, I will definitely call off work today. And I'll be sure to stay indoors.
