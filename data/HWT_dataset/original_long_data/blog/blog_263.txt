This morning i woke up extremely fatigued, dizzy, nauseated and my leg, feet and back muscles ached. Two things went through my head...which couldn't possiblely be. It wasn't. I gather from my ailments, that i'm most likely suffering from heat exhaustion. The temperatures here have been wretchedly hot! midafternoon yesterday, it reached a scorching 101 degrees. But as these west coast people are fond of saying 'it's a dry heat.' anyhow, i spent most of the day outdoors (duh!), visiting nurseries and working in the garden. While pruning some shrubs, i ran into several black widows. I hate spiders, especially ugly ones. I think i got a little too happy with the insecticide. Hmmm, so it may be a combination of the heat and insecticide fumes that's making me sick. So, i will definitely call off work today. And i'll be sure to stay indoors.
