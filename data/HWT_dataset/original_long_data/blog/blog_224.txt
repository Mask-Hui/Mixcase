Looks like I'll be getting a new web host very soon, I tried to get this *free* tag board to work but it has to work using .php which (homestead) doesn't support..a real bummer. I found another host (mt) Media Temple that supports almost everything but homestead has a lock on my domain name and I really don't know what to do about that unless I get another domain registered with (mt) media temple which I think I will do. I spent a lot of time and $-money-$ building my website and keeping it updated is a chore but I like doing that kind of stuff, always learning something new and better than what you think you have. I'll keep you posted about how things go with all of it, until next time over & out! Ps- I taught another class at Church last Sunday & it was a real blessing to me even with  the very short notice I had.
