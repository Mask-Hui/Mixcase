I arrived home yesterday, and found her just lying on the floor, not willing to move.  Adding to the fact she was in the same condition that morning, I decided I couldn't wait until her appointment today to have her put down.  So, I called the vet, and got them to let me just drop her off, so they could put her to sleep when they had the time.  Expensive place, $65 to have her put down and to bury her.  But, what can you expect from a vet in a town called 'Richland'?  I miss her, and it still hasn't fully sunk in that she is gone.
