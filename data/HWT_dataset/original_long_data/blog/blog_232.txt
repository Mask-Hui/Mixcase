I now own a cell phone for the last three years, i have been cell phone free.&nbsp; i had one at one point as paul gave it to me as a gift during our first christmas together.&nbsp; i ended up going way over my alloted minute usage and he ulitmately had to pay about a thousand dollars in fees.&nbsp; ooooooooops.&nbsp; it was after he paid that bill that the cell phone was taken away from me.&nbsp; since then, i havent gotten a new one. Well.&nbsp; for my birthday kelly offered to get me a new cellie.&nbsp; last night we went to the local wireless provider and i picked out a new phone!&nbsp; it has a camera and text messaging and instant messenger and it even plays the radio when i plug in my headset.&nbsp; um!&nbsp; what is it?&nbsp; the coolest phone ever?&nbsp; when i woke up this morning i thought fuck.&nbsp; another day.&nbsp; and then i remembered!&nbsp; another day, cept with a cell phone!&nbsp; i jumped out of bed, french kissed it, and got in the shower. &nbsp;i am very pleased.&nbsp; and im finally and adult! this weekend begins my life of chaos.&nbsp; tomorrow is the wedding, sunday my uncles come, monday afternoon my brother flies in from germany.&nbsp; its hard to explain how i feel about all of this.&nbsp; obviously im overwhelmed with excitement.&nbsp; the idea of going home and having my brother there with me is surreal.&nbsp; ive been visiting home just about once a month for the last year and a half and its never been the same without winfield there. On the flip side, im pretty nervous to confront all of the emotions that have been buried since he left for the war.&nbsp; in order for me to survive the last year and a half, i have had to find a way to block my constant worry and upset.&nbsp; now that he is safe and coming home, ive started to realize how deep down ive put all of this stuff.&nbsp; its like im just starting to deal with him being gone now.&nbsp; like i said, its hard to explain. Overall, im so happy and relieved that this moment has finally arrived.&nbsp; i cant believe that in 3 days, ill be looking across the kitchen table at my brother.&nbsp; he will be eating his spaghetti and i will be thinking how much i love him and have missed him.&nbsp; for at least two weeks, my brother will be safe and sound.&nbsp; god has been so good to us and i do believe that since we have been so patient throughout this process, we have finally earned the reward of being a family again. Only 3 more days &nbsp;
