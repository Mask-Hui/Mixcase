I'm happy for both of you.  Really.  Just try and keep the affectionate name calling and banter down on the blog.  And Thomas, I want you to tell me about any PDA's so I can make fun of them.  But no detail, please.  Also, I have a CD I need a copy made of.  I'll get it to you ASAP.  The Republican candidate was decided in a game of Soul Caliber because we couldn't find Mortal Combal and it's better anyway.  Of course, the Skeleton and Palpatine each tried to mind control each other until they were both trying to let the other one win, making it a competition to see who could lose best, with the loser winning.  The Skeleton was losing (winning) when he suddenly said 'I sleep now' restoring Palpatine's control of his own mind for long enough to beat the crap out of the skeleton's character.  So Palpatine wins.  Opposing him for the Democrats will be:  The Duck man (from Discworld) Daniel Day (the one who used to go to middle school with most of us, not to be confused with Daniel Day Lewis, the actor) Lawrence Fishburne The Reverand Al Sharpton  Make your vote count!  The Betty-one looks drowsy!
