-it is no surprise that a generation of children of divorce have grown into a world of extended adolescence, in which so many of them have slept with one another and remained friends, have put the conflicts of sundered relationships aside for the sake of maintaining a coherent life. Divorce has taught us how to sleep with friends, sleep with enemies and then act like it's all perfectly normal in the morning. - i have so much respect for myself but have very little respect for most of the people i sleep with, particularly my subs. Is it that i think i am closer to perfection and less susceptible to temptation than the 'typical chauvinistic males'? i have stronger grudges against women than men, but the biggest grudge i have is against myself. I am an actor, a dramatised projection of a few minor traits in my personality, and i use this facade to appear genuine. It works, but i never call them again. Should the guy be saying that? - bethany is a dirty hussy.
