Well, it doesn't help that a few of my old classmates(Christopher Community High School Class of 1985) had kids that graduated HIGH SCHOOL this time....plus the passing of former President Ronald Reagan.....all make me feel really old.  I was mostly a kid during the Reagan administration.  I was only 13 when he was elected in 1980 and in 1984 only 17(missed that election by one month..turned 18 that December).  As far as well defined personalities...the man was a comedian and impersonator's DREAM.    I've not had much sleep as I'm writing this, so if my thoughts are somewhat disjointed, this is why........
