Yes, today is turning out to be quite nice even though i was up all night reading the da vinci code. It's a book i am enjoying quite a bit. Started it last night and i am almost done with it. I can see why it is on the best seller's list. Later this afternoon the hubby and i are going to go over to visit friends of ours. They are an older couple who just got back from england and i can't wait to hear all about it. I always enjoy the time i spend with jackie and ken. They are a lovely, warm couple. I'm going over to help teach her how to use her re-write cd so she can make copies of pictures. She says she also has a million questions to ask me about the computer too. I guess this means i'll be working for my supper. ~smile~ i don't mind. The time passes so quickly when we are with them. She's making dinner and we're picking up dessert. Sounds like a plan.
