Yes, today is turning out to be quite nice even though I was up all night reading The Da Vinci Code. It's a book I am enjoying quite a bit. Started it last night and I am almost done with it. I can see why it is on the Best Seller's List.   Later this afternoon the hubby and I are going to go over to visit friends of ours. They are an older couple who just got back from England and I can't wait to hear all about it. I always enjoy the time I spend with Jackie and Ken. They are a lovely, warm couple. I'm going over to help teach her how to use her re-write cd so she can make copies of pictures. She says she also has a million questions to ask me about the computer too. I guess this means I'll be working for my supper. ~smile~ I don't mind. The time passes so quickly when we are with them. She's making dinner and we're picking up dessert. Sounds like a plan.
