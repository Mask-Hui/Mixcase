Is it june already? dang, 2004 is flying by. It’s a three-day work week, thanks to the holiday yesterday and my going away on friday. I love short weeks. I’m thinking of various different ways to improve this website. In addition to the picture on the right, you can now see a weather pixie, detailing the latest weather conditions at jfk international airport. If anyone knows of any other fun do-hickeys that i can add to this site, please let me know! sometime today i have to write my final class notes column for the vassar quarterly. I inherited the job a few years ago from a former correspondent who reads this blog (long story!) it’s been a fun job with minimal work – only about an hour, twice a year – but even still, i’m happy to be done with it. The novelty of writing the column wears off after a couple of years. I hereby pass the torch to whoever else wants to do it. Tonight i am seeing “fiddler on the roof.” although i have seen the show many, many, many times, this is the first version that i’m seeing on broadway. Thanks to jessica for providing free tickets! a review will be forthcoming tomorrow.
