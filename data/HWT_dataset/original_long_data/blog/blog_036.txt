Is it June already?  Dang, 2004 is flying by.  It’s a three-day work week, thanks to the holiday yesterday and my going away on Friday.  I love short weeks.  I’m thinking of various different ways to improve this website.  In addition to the picture on the right, you can now see a Weather Pixie, detailing the latest weather conditions at JFK International Airport.  If anyone knows of any other fun do-hickeys that I can add to this site, please let me know!  Sometime today I have to write my final Class Notes column for the Vassar Quarterly.  I inherited the job a few years ago from a former correspondent who reads this blog (long story!)  It’s been a fun job with minimal work – only about an hour, twice a year – but even still, I’m happy to be done with it.  The novelty of writing the column wears off after a couple of years.  I hereby pass the torch to whoever else wants to do it.   Tonight I am seeing “Fiddler on the Roof.”  Although I have seen the show many, many, many times, this is the first version that I’m seeing on Broadway.  Thanks to Jessica for providing free tickets!  A review will be forthcoming tomorrow.
