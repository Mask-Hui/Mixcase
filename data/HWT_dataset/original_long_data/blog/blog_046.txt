Attitude: bored Mood: indifferent, looking forward to tonight  Been a long hard day in the trenches here today folks, almost no time to write anything for you readers. however it's good to see Tigger(now akcron) taking up the reigns herself and making an appearance and talking about things :)   Not much to say about things, yesterday was shakespeare on the green, was a lovely play, but I had to leave before closing curtain, which kinda sucked, hopefully someday I'll see the entirety of a shakespeare play. but I digress.  Akcron is right about the problems with the shower, it sucks, in terms of laughing at her in the shower, you have to admit, the look people get when committing self torture can be pretty entertaining. I took one myself in fact, but then again I'm used to it. early Basic Training and later Field exercises were both sans hot water, and thus we got to enjoy the blasts of cold water. I rate our current shower scenario a 2 out of possible 10 where 10 is the warmest. I use the showers in the field as the coldest this side of a snowball.   Anyway, we did more EQ last night and will do more probably tonight as is what is typical, so expect more ziggur camp blogging to ensue.
