23 days 3 hours and 59 minutes of work left   Well my lovelies I have decided its time we started using our beloved blogger again.  Oh am maybe we could change the name to Kaia and Gede come home :)  or maybe the Mclachlan St gang come home :)  Anyway, as you can see I am not really focusing on going away, well maybe just a little bit.  It is all very exciting but looking at my to do list (composed by mum) I am getting a little scared what with having to: - organise my super - organise a will (Way too scarey ??????) - organise power of attorney - do all the bills etc - clear out cupboards both at Mclachlan St and Spruzen Ave (knew it would come back to bite me one day!!!) - etc etc etc,  However to deal with this panic I have decided to focus on my own list: - Watch Love Actually ahhhhh - Think of Hugh Grant ahhhhhhhhh hehehehehe - Look at flats in London that I will never be able to afford unless I discover I am the illegitimate child of the queen - Drink Cask Wine - Drink G&T's - Hang out with my lovely friends - Eat cheezels - well I won't be able to eat them for a couple of years - don't think I want to after yesterday - Generally avoid anything grown up  Speaking of which must get back to work.  Remember everyone we must practice blogger before we are flung too far around the world.  Much Love Kai xoxo
