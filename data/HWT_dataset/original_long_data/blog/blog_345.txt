You are most like remus lupin: kind, considerate, polite, intelligent, quiet, secretive (no one can blame you though, yours is a big secret)but you are outgoing with your closest friends. You know what it's like to be picked on, so you don't pick on others. You know what it is like to have no friends, so you appreciate the ones you have. One last thing, remus lupin is a tame werewolf, as long as he doesn't forget to take some wolfsbane potion nowdays) urllink a which maraurder are you personality test brought to you by urllink quizilla so you are despiratly hoping that letter is from remus huh? you know, you should have realized he was a werewolf sooner. Lupin is a part of the technical name for a werewolf. Now you are one too. A match of two werewolves has never been heard of before. Lets hope that this makes you a perfect match! and give lupin all of your support and let him know you do not blame him for what happened, for that is what he needs right now. Urllink an adventure with the maraurders part 3 brought to you by urllink quizilla you definitley like remus, but more like a friend, ( you get the old image then) maybe closer relation will form when you finish well, you know anyways, i hope. But you could be still or starting to think about others. Maybe sirius, or it could be serverus snape! (i don't know) whoever you pick, good luck at getting him as a date for the dance! urllink an adventure with the maraurders part 4 brought to you by urllink quizilla the severus snape part is aaaallllll me!!! (because i sent the person a message sayig that i hoped the letter was from snape, but lupin won... So now i'm hoping thati can go to that dance with sevvey!) well, padfoot and i have decided that sevvey would listen to queen. And he would dance to it around the dungeons to 'another on bites the dust' then lewis would barge in and be like 'yay!!!' and start dancing with snape and snape would be like 'i wasn't dancing! i tripped!' but lewis would be like 'i don't care!! let's dance anyways!!' and snape would be like 'no!!' but he would succumb to his desires and start dancing and he’d be really good and lewis would be like “wow” and snape would realize what he was doing and he'd be like 'no' and lewis would constantly remind him of that with a smug look on his face and snape would be like 'no, i don't recall that,' and lewis would be like 'yes you do,'or like lewis: “snape do you remember the night we dance-“ ”no” and i should stop but i'm having fun so... Padfoot and i were also wondering wether snape dipped his fries in ketchup or wether he poured it on or if he liked mustard on them. Personally, i think that snape would pour ketchup on his fries. I think that snape would listen: radio day time talkshows opra and queen lewis would listen to: queen, aqua, haddaway, and powerman5000 urllink -s-s-s-sarah could it be your destiny, to be in the house of moony? your mind is vast and so understanding that only trying to hide things is loony. Urllink if the hogwarts houses were based on the marouders...which house would you be in(very cool plz take) brought to you by urllink quizilla i believe i’m beginning to see a pattern...
