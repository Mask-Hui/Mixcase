Urllink mozilla just changed the name of their 'next-generation browser' from firebird to firefox. They also released version 0.8 today. They have made a lot of improvements from version 0.7, including the addition of an installer. The biggest problem i was having with firebird was with the extensions. Some extensions did not seem to work well with others, and there was no way to remove the extensions once they were installed. I suppose that was mostly not firebird's fault though. Other than the extensions, i really didn't have any problems. Because of the new release today, all of the firefox extension web sites have gone down today due to heavy traffic. Firefox does a few things better than opera, but i think that i will still stick with opera for now. I just love it too much. But those of you who still use internet explorer should give firefox a try. By the way, i just love the new firefox logo. Here is where you can get some firefox buttons to add to your web site: urllink http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/buttons.html
