Is it just me, or do kids lose their minds when we go shopping? It just started lately, but they seem to lose their hearing and whatever little self-control that they already have. Every excursion these days turns into WWIII where Peter and I are both stressed to the max. We make a point of making sure they're not tired, hungry or thirsty. They've been pretty good about going places before, but lately they have changed big time. Is it just us or do you have the same problem? We're open to suggestions because at this point, we're ready to try just about anything.  Posted by: Niki
