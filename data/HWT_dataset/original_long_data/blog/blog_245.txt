One can only study Sociology for so long, you know, before ever fibre in your being screams for you to do something,  anything  else. Tonight, it just so happened to be cataloguing my video games. Now, this isn't an exhaustive list of every game I've owned, because that would include titles from the following systems:  01) NES 02) Game Boy 03) Super NES 04) Virtual Boy 05) PlayStation 06) Nintendo 64 07) Sega Saturn 08) PlayStation 2 09) Gamecube 10) Game Boy Advance  Instead, I've merely compiled the games I  currently  have in my possession, whether they be legitimate purchases or emulated ROMs. It's only a start, but I've already listed  159  games total. You can check the list out  urlLink here .  I would finish the list, but ever since Gregg mentioned Jeremy was enthralled with  Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell  for Gamecube, I dusted it off and began playing it again...and as can be expected, I am firmly in it's pixelated grasp.
