I'm really confused.  Elle has been calling and emailing me nonstop.  She is desperate for us to be friends, but it can be so hard to be friends when one person has thrown themselves so emotionally at the other.  Its even harder when, at times, those feelings are reciprocated, but only sometimes.  Its like I am dealing with a split personality.  She regrets we ever stepped past the lines of friendship, but if you were to read the emails, or hear the phone calls, you'd sense the flirtation in all of it (telling me about taping a picture of the two of us on her computer, etc.).  I feel like I am just some tool she can use to continually validate her desirability while she stays in her relationship.  When  I am apart from her like this.  The whole friend think is ok.  I can keep my emotional distance.  But as soon as I see or touch her, I turn into jelly and I want to break down and cry and fall to my knees and beg her to be mine in some ultimate display of how pathetic I can be.  I think this means I can never be in the same room with her again.  I have no will power when it comes to her though.  I am a weak weak man.  On a better note.  I highly encourage everyone to come to Bar 13 tonight to hear the impeccable Sarah spin her tunes, dance with me, and, of course, drink all the free alcohol they will be giving away.  Plus, the CEO gave everyone the day off tomorrow.  That means I will be dancin and drinkin til the crack of dawn (or until my sickness kills me, which it might.  My throat is swelling up and my fever is returning).   All I have to do tomorrow is get my rat pack suit tailored for my brother's wedding.  PS.  Still no date for the wedding.  But if you do come to Bar 13 tonight, please remember that I am a sick sick man in case I look absolutely deranged and utterly unappetizing.  Its not me at my best.
