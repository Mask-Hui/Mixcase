Well, today was Father's Day.  Our church gave a copy of  urlLink this book  to every father.  We have a giving church.  Called Dad today and wished him a happy Mother's Day. That's just how twisted I am.  Had a good conversation with my parents this afternoon. They're some of the neatest people I know.  I played 'sound man' tonight at church. It's always fun to be in the sound booth pushing buttons and sliding sliders. I do good at sound-stuff, I think.  Tomorrow it's back to the office. Pastor Steve is back, so I'm sure we'll do some 'catching up' during our usual weekly Monday lunch meetings.  After work I have to come home and paint for a bunch of hours. I like to paint. I can't remember if I told the listening audience that I've been hired to paint the next door apartments AND put up a small shed in the back of each one.  Good times.  Oh, before I finish tonight's post - you've gotta see this - file  urlLink this one  under 'ironic'!
