Well, today was father's day. Our church gave a copy of urllink this book to every father. We have a giving church. Called dad today and wished him a happy mother's day. That's just how twisted i am. Had a good conversation with my parents this afternoon. They're some of the neatest people i know. I played 'sound man' tonight at church. It's always fun to be in the sound booth pushing buttons and sliding sliders. I do good at sound-stuff, i think. Tomorrow it's back to the office. Pastor steve is back, so i'm sure we'll do some 'catching up' during our usual weekly monday lunch meetings. After work i have to come home and paint for a bunch of hours. I like to paint. I can't remember if i told the listening audience that i've been hired to paint the next door apartments and put up a small shed in the back of each one. Good times. Oh, before i finish tonight's post - you've gotta see this - file urllink this one under 'ironic'!
