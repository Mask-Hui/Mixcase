I dunno who will read this blog, I haven't decided but, when I do I will share it with my friends...life has been a little crazy, last night Jake asked me to go to one of his friends houses to get wasted..yeah uh NO!  so everyboday thought I was gonna go with him, and I admit I was kinda nervous because I did kinda want to be with him, so it was closing and I called my dad and told him that some friends had asked me to go get some ice cream from somewhere..he believed me and I did feel bad, but I was excited and also scared..well Kevin being the friend I prolly needed that moment, told me not to go, that I could get hurt and that if I did he was gonna get his shotgun, and hurt someone....that someone being Jake.  so after everything was closed Jake said that maybe we could just drive around for a bit...I was ok with that..but in the back of my mind and looking at him..I felt that if I went with him something awful was going to happen...so I talked to Stephanie secretly and she came up to us and said ' I thought you were going to come to my house for awhile'  and Jake told me that it was ok if I wanted to go with her...so I did..and when I got in her car I cried...I had gotten away from him..and I am glad..I don't know what I would have done with him...If I had went..who knows...
