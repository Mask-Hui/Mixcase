I dunno who will read this blog, i haven't decided but, when i do i will share it with my friends...life has been a little crazy, last night jake asked me to go to one of his friends houses to get wasted..yeah uh no! so everyboday thought i was gonna go with him, and i admit i was kinda nervous because i did kinda want to be with him, so it was closing and i called my dad and told him that some friends had asked me to go get some ice cream from somewhere..he believed me and i did feel bad, but i was excited and also scared..well kevin being the friend i prolly needed that moment, told me not to go, that i could get hurt and that if i did he was gonna get his shotgun, and hurt someone....that someone being jake. So after everything was closed jake said that maybe we could just drive around for a bit...i was ok with that..but in the back of my mind and looking at him..i felt that if i went with him something awful was going to happen...so i talked to stephanie secretly and she came up to us and said ' i thought you were going to come to my house for awhile' and jake told me that it was ok if i wanted to go with her...so i did..and when i got in her car i cried...i had gotten away from him..and i am glad..i don't know what i would have done with him...if i had went..who knows...
