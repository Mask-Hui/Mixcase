Yesterday was fun. Amy picked me up and we went to starbucks and hung out. Shortly afterwards laura showed up and the three of us talked for a bit. After a bit, chris and amy’s friend jay showed up and laura was heading off and jay and amy went to go pick up andrea. So chris and i stuck around for a bit and eventually cody showed up and shortly afterwards amy and jay came back with andrea. So the six of us hung out for a bit and decided to head over to the fair oaks part for a bit. Cody, chris, and i were playing a bit of lacrosse and andrea even tried some, which was kinda funny. =p but the six of us just hung out and eventually went over to amy’s house cause it was close by and we played halo for a bit, which is a really awesome game. But after that amy was going to spend the night at andrea’s so chris dropped me off on his way home and that was about it. Later i found out that josh stopped by shortly after we all had left and i feel bad cause i feel like i dragged him all the way out here and wasn’t even there. So yeah i felt bad about that… and amy and i aren’t going on our beach trip today in case you couldn’t tell. I ended up waking up today at almost two. And to be honest, i think i deserved it. I haven’t slept well at all recently so i just needed some rest.
