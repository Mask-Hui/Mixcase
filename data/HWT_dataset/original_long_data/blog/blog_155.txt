Yesterday was fun.  Amy picked me up and we went to Starbucks and hung out.  Shortly afterwards Laura showed up and the three of us talked for a bit.  After a bit, Chris and Amy’s friend Jay showed up and Laura was heading off and Jay and Amy went to go pick up Andrea.  So Chris and I stuck around for a bit and eventually Cody showed up and shortly afterwards Amy and Jay came back with Andrea.  So the six of us hung out for a bit and decided to head over to the Fair Oaks part for a bit.  Cody, Chris, and I were playing a bit of lacrosse and Andrea even tried some, which was kinda funny.  =P  But the six of us just hung out and eventually went over to Amy’s house cause it was close by and we played Halo for a bit, which is a really awesome game. But after that Amy was going to spend the night at Andrea’s so Chris dropped me off on his way home and that was about it.  Later I found out that Josh stopped by shortly after we all had left and I feel bad cause I feel like I dragged him all the way out here and wasn’t even there.  So yeah I felt bad about that…  And Amy and I aren’t going on our beach trip today in case you couldn’t tell.  I ended up waking up today at almost two.  And to be honest, I think I deserved it.  I haven’t slept well at all recently so I just needed some rest.
