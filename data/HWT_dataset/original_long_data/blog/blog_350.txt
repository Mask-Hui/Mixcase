Hum... Nothing to say, bar rock on Cheboygan. You polka luvin freaks!  I had a hamster and his name was Fred. Took him to see the sites and sound of the outside world. Now the roads run red... CAUSE FRED'S DEAD BABY!   If life is like a bowl of Cherries, does that mean death is and empty bowl with Cherry stalks... There something to look forward too!!  Never bite the hand that feeds you... No wait till they turn around, there's more meat in the Ass!!  Laugh and the world laughs with you... HA! Only cause you have a stupid Laugh, you unfunny Fuck!  Hump-de-dumb-tee sat on a wall. Hump-de-dumb-tee had great fall. All the kings horses and all the kings men couldn't put Poor Hump-de together again.... YEAH! Well the reason he had a great fall was because he was jerking off looking a Little miss Muffit. Feel sorry for him NOW!!  Every journey starts with a signal step... Not if you are Yoda!   And I'm spent!!
