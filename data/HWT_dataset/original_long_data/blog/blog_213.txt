'i'm tired of being second rate...of not believing i can do better...of being mean for no reason, for judging people when they never asked to be judged, saying things that hurt people down instead of building them up...i'm tired of not living each day to its fullness...of disappointing others in my selfish pursuits...i'm tired of standing on the sidelines when i could be out there...for shirking when i should be outgoing, for not taking chances worth taking...for not being there when people really need to talk, or when they need a smile or a compliment...i'm tired of not meeting new people for staying in the shadows, of lying to people, for slandering when they never did anything...i'm tired of waking and feeling tired...i'm tired of putting off the change...the time has come.' - momma hester
