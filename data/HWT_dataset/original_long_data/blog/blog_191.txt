Urllink fancy shmancy --> that's exactly what v bar was at the santana row....lno made their mark there but of course... The only down side to it was that they didn't have a dance floor! how can you have some knocken music with some ansy drunk people walking around with no dance floor! mun! no cover charge which was good... But the drinks were like ultra dynamic expensive...$14 for a long beach (which is my drink by the way) and $10 for a well drink (cran & vodka, etc.)... So the girls initiated... Too broke to splurge...mingled...and by the end of the night we all each had at least two drinks, were feeling a cool buzz and didn't have to spend a dime.... Wow... Now that is definitely an advantage of being a girl...or should i say lady... Or ladies night out>.... Uuuaaahh... Anyway, i'm at work right now and i'm about to be off in about half an hour... I'm leaving to bakersfield this weekend for rich's cousin's engagement party. Definitely my first time to meet the extended family...but i'm definitely looking forward to it... Anndd! i'm going to the camarillo outlets! hheeeeyy!!!! i'm trying to get an early start on christmas shopping... And i've already made my list...and hopefully for the first time i'll actually stick with the list and not add more to it... Which i doubt... Well... Have a great wet weekend!
