My dog died this morning. She has been rather strange for a few days, and had a massive stroke last night. Not a pretty sight, something twitching and frightened, unable to move, covered in it's own bodily fluids. We called the vet around and he gave her a massive dose of anaesthetic to put her out of her misery. He had trouble finding a vein though, and in the end injected her directly into her jugular and heart to do it quickly. She'd had a good life though, she was around 16, a fair age for a dog. We just have Bilbo left now, who although old and rather smelly is full of life and will hopefully stick around for a while yet. Happy new year everyone, have a fantastic night tonight and wipe the slate clean for a new start. Remember, life is short and precious - make the most of every possible moment.
