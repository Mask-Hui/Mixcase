Music - it was fear of myself that made me odd by alexisonfire wow what a day. The rain never seemed to stop. It's still going now... Blah. Well any way , i don't know what i said earlier today, i dont even remember posting, but . . . I went to the mall with kate around 12? oh yeah and i got to talk to my friend alli on the phone lol its been awhile.&nbsp; she's awesome.&nbsp; i dont remember, i cant remember anything obviously. We just walked around and whatnot.&nbsp; i saw chris and we ate with him. Haha it was funny. Then this guy was handing out free soda which r0cked. I shouldn't be drinking soda.... Cuz of that damned diet, but it was c2 so i didnt feel that bad.&nbsp;&nbsp; (music - 'hey it's your funeral mama' by alexisonfire) , , so afterwards i went home (330ish). I showered and just lounged... Played guitar ect. W/e . So around 5 i went to pick up kate again, and we went to dinner. Good time. Then we went back to her house, exchanged our belated bday gifts, and watched underworld.&nbsp; she got me a family guy poster, and this crazy atreyu shirt. So i left her house just&nbsp;a little while&nbsp;ago. Man i was actually scared to drive. First time, i actually would rather drive with my parents.&nbsp;o well. I made it home in about 20 mins when it should have taken 9 mins. O well. Better safe then dead.&nbsp; oh yeah if u couldn't tell from the current music,&nbsp; i got the new alexisonfire cd watch out!.&nbsp; (music - accidents by alexisonfire). Btw for all you out there that don't know, its pronounced alexis on fire, not alex is on fire , or al ex iso n fir e. Ok got it? of course. Its pretty good. Classic alex. I guess i can say classic in relation to the 1st album. Tis all. I gotta work tomorrow at 4 or something. O well, its been a nice vacation off from w0rk. But everything that has a beginning has an end. And this is just one of them. I think i'll ask if i can work in the pharmacy. Thatd be nice considering i may end up doing that for the rest of my life after college........... Till the morrow.
