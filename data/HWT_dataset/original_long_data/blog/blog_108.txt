urlLink   Sunday Telegraph Letters: On Birth Row   Cherie Blair should look a bit closer to home before criticising the morality of America's use of the death penalty from a Catholic perspective (News, February 8). Has she forgotten that her own husband has voted in the Commons for abortion on demand, abortion up to birth for disabled babies, and the use of the human embryo as a guinea pig in scientific experiments?  Her horror at the possibility of executing the innocent sits uneasily with her husband's enthusiasm for killing the innocent. Has any abortionist ever granted a stay of execution?  I think the scriptural warning to avoid hypocrisy is apt - one should not point out the speck in another's eye while ignoring the plank in one's own eye.  From: Stewart Finn, London SW17
