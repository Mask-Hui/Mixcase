Oh god. The semi sucked. I hated it. Very, very boring. Everyone at my table was great, but we were so isolated from everyone else, and the reserved places made everyone seem so categorized - you could only hang out with your table, it seemed.    Add the fact that all my guy friends brought a date, making it exceedingly awkward to make stupid jokes with them, didn't help.   Add to that the shoes, which look like the sexiest shoes in the world, but in truth are the most agonizingly painful.   Add to that the frozen food, the discomfort of a strapless bra, the frustration at knowing no eligible guys to date, and the fear that there never will be an eligible guy to date - well, let's just say that it made a pretty pot of horrors.    By the way, it's not so much the fact that I want a boyfriend, it's that I want someone who I can just be myself with; I honestly don't know anyone who's like that. I want the comfort of knowing that somebody loves me - friends somewhat give that comfort, but there's nothing like a kiss on the cheek.   Heh, not that I'd know - for all I know, boyfriends are absolute hell. I am such a naive little innocent. I haven't even seen American Pie. Which sucks, because everyone else has. I'm still not fully aware of the significance of the phrase, 'This one time, at band camp.' I feel very left out. lol.   Anyways, at least A's sleepover was interesting. I love her room; she has inspired me and I've decided I'm going to go nuts decorating mine, too. Go markers and doodles and rubber duckies! Not only that, but C looked remarkably like the sister of a guy I used to crush on. I keep forgetting to ask her if she has relatives in O. That would be so cool, if she was related to him. And I wouldn't be too surprised, either; they look so alike, it's not even funny. I got the heebiejeebies just looking at her lol.   I'm done my rambling now, ciao :)
