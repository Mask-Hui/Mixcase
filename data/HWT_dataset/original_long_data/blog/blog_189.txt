Another week just flew by me.   I drove by the new house yesterday and the front window was covered in boxes. We may get the keys at closing, I am getting so excited. If all goes well this week, we will be set for closing a week from Wednesday.  I was up until after 3:00am last night watching movies with Bethany. There has been a lot of movie watching going on around here lately.  Here's my rundown; Last night we watched Thirteen, a movie every mother of a teen should see. It was better then I expected.  Then we watched Gigli,  yeah it was just as bad as the media said it was, but we had to see for ourselves.  Underworld - I thought it was okay, didn't like it as much as I thought I would.  There was just something too laughable about vampires with cellphones to me. I guess I am more of a traditional vampire fan.  Cabin Fever - didn't care for this either, only wasted about 40 minutes of my time.  Feddie VS Jason - I really liked it! I thought it was a lot of fun how they blended the first two movies together. If you watch this one, just don't get up and walk away until the credits are rolling or you'll miss one of the funniest endings.  Once Upon A Time In Mexico - I love it!  A fun movie with true Johnny Depp style and humor.  Open Range - I missed most of this movie, but it looked pretty good.
