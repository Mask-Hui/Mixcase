Maybe i'm caught up in the hoopla of the deletion of a band that we love so much at the same time the release of a new lp, but after seeing urllink vida blue last weekend, and listening to army of one today repeatedly, it has come to my attention that while urllink trey is the shredding frontman who is a magician with the guitar, who takes us to the highest peaks, brings us the most pleasure, but also the most pain, it is page, urllink page mcconnell who is the true musician from a to z. The skills - the voice - the stage presence - the bald head - the smile...its page's world, we're all just along for the ride. I see the future in page. Or maybe i'm just tired, hungover, and on an emotional page high. Either way, he rocks.
