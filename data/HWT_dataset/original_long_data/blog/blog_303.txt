Weekend over, homework done and dusted and another successful gig. Went to london with guides yesterday- had to get up at the ridiculously early hour of 7.30 in the morning so i could be at the coach for 8.45. I didn't even know that 7.30 existed on a saturday! i thought it just... Wasn't there! got to london and went on the london eye, which was very nice and immediately forgettable. Then headed to wembley arena for the 'big gig'- 10,000 screaming girls(not one boy- gutted, hehehe), a bunch of fairly well known-ish pop stars and fearne cotton from cbbc. It was all fairly boring, the cheeky girls being the main highlight, until...... Mark owen came on!! mark bloody owen! i had no idea he was on and i was soooo impressed. I started going on about how he was my favourite member of take that, but none of the people i was with had heard of them... Felt so old. Boo hiss. Butbutbut! all was not lost when liberty x arrived and were just great . They finished their set with just a little (sexxxyyyy) and i then immediately went to the toilet to ring selina and tell her allll about it, while atomic kitten were on. Then had to survive a 3hour journey home in between a bunch of hyperactive 12 year-olds and 3 miserable teenagers who kept telling them to shut up. Do they not understand how much i need my sleep?? gah. Another achievement of saturday was the acquisition of draper's number from coz. Texted him, flirted a bit, got a reply: no flirt. Alas. Replied, flirted a bit more... No reply so far. Dammit. Ceff x and you're so innocent, please don't take it wrong cos it's a compliment...
