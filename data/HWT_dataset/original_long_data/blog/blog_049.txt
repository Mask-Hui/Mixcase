Watching paint dry not everything i've done in my life compares to watching paint dry, but i participated in something today that ranks right up there with it. This morning i was part of a group that upgraded our work pcs to a customized version of windows xp. The installation process took about an hour and a half. That the company i'm working for had set this up as an automated process probably kept it from taking longer. But backing up everything, installing other applications i work with, and bringing the backed-up data after the installation made entire process take about 4 hours. So, you wanna know how i passed the time? that's right. You've guessed. I played pinball on my laptop that i obtained from the consulting company i work for. I'm actually getting pretty good at it. My highest score so far is over 5 million points. Update: in case you haven't realized, this is sign of urllink geekiness i know... This doesn't have much to do with the price of tea in china, but hey! - it's a lot better than watching paint dry.
