Wow it's been a while. Yesterday was a very sad day. I hate to see people crying. I'm good at keeping a dry face even as my throat is clenched and my heart pounds. That is what helps me help them. Even if it's not much, just saying that it will be ok with strength and conviction can help someone. To those in the moment of weakness the strong people KNOW that it's going to be ok. And look at them, they are strong and they are sturdy, they know what's going on.  You can not convey the message of hope if you yourself become a mess with empathy. Although for the most part I can hold my own and carry this small little message, I cannot seem to stand tall when one particular person cries. My heart brakes and before you know it there are tears in my eyes. Often I have said that all things must pass and that the good and the bad must be accepted; however this particular specimen of a human being seems to deserve more then what the world has to offer. How dare anyone harm angels? You wonder if they even see it. Blind little fools who see the precious diamond like a clump of dirt. The angel is not part of this world, the rules of the wheel do not apply in this case. Heh Ill go write a song about this...
