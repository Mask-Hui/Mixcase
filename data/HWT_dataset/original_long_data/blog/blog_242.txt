So last night, I shaved my husband's head. As violent and interesting as that may sound, it's quite reasonable. It was last night, we were again getting ready for bed in the sleepy fog of 11 pm and my husband says to me, 'do you think I would look okay with a shaved head?' At which point, I spent the next twenty minutes trying to discourage him from such an act of risk and insanity brought on by mid-life crisis-like symptoms with the possibility of chemo patient likeness.  I think the line that I should have rethought was this one, when I had finally swallowed my irritation and actually tried to be diplomatic, 'well, it depends on what's more important to you, convenience or attractiveness' He left the room, returned,  handed me his mustache trimmer and plopped a chair and a trash bag in front of the mirror. Scientists are never slaves to fashion, I keep forgetting. 'Alright fine, I'll shave your head' I said when I really meant 'You'll be sorry.'  It was like those kids in the chair at boot camp, thick masses of hair coming off and leaving short mown streaks. He wanted it about a quarter of an inch, an eighth on the sides, so there was a bit of blending involved. I was fighting the temptation to mutter 'whoops' and touch a spot on the back of his head in concern. But I was good, and at the end I looked at my military creation and pondered at what a great haircut my unskilled hand had mustered. He ran his palm over the top and exclaimed 'hey you're pretty good at this, maybe you can do it next time.' Darn, I thought that holding the clippers backwards and upside-down and wondering why it wouldnt cut might dissuade him, but nothing can discourage a man from the promise of convenience.
