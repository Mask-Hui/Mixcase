The shops by India Knight the book about how, why and where to shop. Personally I thought this was going to be a boring girlie book about shopping funny enough but to my delight when I did pick the book up, not only is it full of head nodding moments we have all been in. It is also written with a sense of humor you can't help but giggle. Even if you are on the train like myself tonight.  The main reason however I am now writing this in my blog is because this book has a good few pages dedicated to underwear including a section on 'Bras for big bosoms' and 'buy your normal - bosomed girlfriend a bra from here' and the invaluable advice, if you are unsure of sizes DO NOT BUY LARGE - great advice for anyone buying underwear as a gift.   urlLink Click here  to read more about the book
