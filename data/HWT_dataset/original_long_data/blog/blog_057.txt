I’m usually not all that into film scores but this one is really great. Almost as great as the movie it springs from, brion’s piano and orchestral stuff are moving and delightful, although not as strange and inventive as his score to punch drunk love . All gets even better when you throw in the pop perfection of elo’s “mr. Blue sky”, a weird bollywood pop song, and beck’s cover of korgis’ “everybody's gotta learn sometimes”. (who are korgis? hell if i know but this song has peaked my interest!) additionally, there is a one jon brion song “strings that tie you” that nicely under scores the heart of film.
