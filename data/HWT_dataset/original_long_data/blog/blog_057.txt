After about a 45 minute jog-walk, I can back from the wonderful outdoors and weighed-in.  I didn't lose or gain either weight or bodyfat.  For that, I am extremely thankful!  Keeping my fingers crossed, my monitor seems to be doing well.  I just changed my windows color scheme to be a little 'lighter.'  I hope that works.  Since the weather is so nice (highs in the mid to upper 60s - clear, sunny skies), I decided to try on an old pair of Gap khaki shorts (size 32).  Miracle of miracles, they fit!  I paired that with a yellow cotton pique polo.  Tonight is 'Oscar night.'  Mom and I never fail to watch them.  We usually watch every awards show.  Yes, we're award show junkies!
