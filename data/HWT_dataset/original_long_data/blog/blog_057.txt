After about a 45 minute jog-walk, i can back from the wonderful outdoors and weighed-in. I didn't lose or gain either weight or bodyfat. For that, i am extremely thankful! keeping my fingers crossed, my monitor seems to be doing well. I just changed my windows color scheme to be a little 'lighter.' i hope that works. Since the weather is so nice (highs in the mid to upper 60s - clear, sunny skies), i decided to try on an old pair of gap khaki shorts (size 32). Miracle of miracles, they fit! i paired that with a yellow cotton pique polo. Tonight is 'oscar night.' mom and i never fail to watch them. We usually watch every awards show. Yes, we're award show junkies!
