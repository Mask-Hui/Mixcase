In response or, not quite myself today pippa, congrats and welcome home. Sorry about the tragicness of it all, and the blackout must have made motherhood that much worse ;) fred, i hadn't even noticed the parallels between the two - and had tried to block it all out. Thanks for reminding me. Candy and doc, i know you're responsible for it all. Two brains driving around the country, in the spot where the blackout occurs. Coincidence? i think not. Say what you will, you will not convince me otherwise (hee hee) and finally, i recieved this today, and just had to share: to those of you who send me those damn 'forward this e-mail to 10 of your friends, or else...' this is how i feel....
