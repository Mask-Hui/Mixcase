Many people that know me.. know how I feel about circumcision because of what I have gone through.&nbsp; There are a lot of people out there that say it says so in the bible... BEEEEP!&nbsp; Simply not so...   urlLink http://www.cirp.org/pages/cultural/glass2/   What people don't realize is that it was from the old testament and a LOT of things have changed from the old testament.&nbsp; Lets give a well known fact as well... the United States is the only country in the world that does male genital mutilation on a large scale basis.  Women and people in general are completely brain washed here in the United States.&nbsp; People are taught that intact men are unclean and are often made fun of and told their item is 'ugly'.&nbsp; Simple fact of the matter is that it is not unclean and it may have been a problem a long long time ago when hygeine was a problem; but that is simply not so these days.  Men today are also confused because they think what they have is fine.&nbsp; Which for most men they don't have any problems with their circ's; but some do.&nbsp; If men knew how much better their love making would be and feel if they were intact.. hell no they wouldn't put their children through it.&nbsp; Men just don't know any better and women are taught that it is dirty if they see a guy that isn't cut.&nbsp; All of this madness drives me to almost pure insanity sometimes because of the problems I had with my botched childhood circ.  Maybe as time goes on I'll go into more detail of what I grew up with.  Rob
