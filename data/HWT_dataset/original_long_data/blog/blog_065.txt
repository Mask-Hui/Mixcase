Many people that know me.. Know how i feel about circumcision because of what i have gone through.&nbsp; there are a lot of people out there that say it says so in the bible... Beeeep!&nbsp; simply not so... Urllink http://www.cirp.org/pages/cultural/glass2/ what people don't realize is that it was from the old testament and a lot of things have changed from the old testament.&nbsp; lets give a well known fact as well... The united states is the only country in the world that does male genital mutilation on a large scale basis. Women and people in general are completely brain washed here in the united states.&nbsp; people are taught that intact men are unclean and are often made fun of and told their item is 'ugly'.&nbsp; simple fact of the matter is that it is not unclean and it may have been a problem a long long time ago when hygeine was a problem; but that is simply not so these days. Men today are also confused because they think what they have is fine.&nbsp; which for most men they don't have any problems with their circ's; but some do.&nbsp; if men knew how much better their love making would be and feel if they were intact.. Hell no they wouldn't put their children through it.&nbsp; men just don't know any better and women are taught that it is dirty if they see a guy that isn't cut.&nbsp; all of this madness drives me to almost pure insanity sometimes because of the problems i had with my botched childhood circ. Maybe as time goes on i'll go into more detail of what i grew up with. Rob
