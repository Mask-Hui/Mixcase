My dad's friend, Greg, just died. I didn't really know him, but I met him once or twice. We went to Cancun with him and his family. Real nice guy. Had three kids, about my dad's age. He worked for my dad, but it didn't really seem like they had a boss-worker relationship. It was more like two friends who did work together, but differently. Or maybe I'm just waxing romantic. I feel numb, cold all over without any notiable change in temperature. I don't feel devestated or deeply depressed, just numb. My dad is taking it hard. He never cries. He needs hugs, a return on all the strength and support he's lent me since I was born. I can't imagine what he's going through I've never lost a friend and I don't want to know what it feels like ever. My dad starting talking about his own death, what I have to do. We joked, it helped him, along with a few drinks. I don't want to talk to anyone for a while. God, I can't imagine how my dad is feeling if just seeing him makes me feel this way. The dead don't grieve, they suffer no loss. It is the living who mourn, the living who are the victims of death. They shed tears for their own loss, because befriending someone is about slightly blurring the edge between you, so part of you becomes them and part of them becomes you and when they die its like a little bit of a piece of you falls into the earth and you weep. And they weep for the world, for the loss of that person which the world so deserved to keep. Love is loss. If you love that which will be lost, then mourning is just a part of love, a phase. I like the picture I put in my last post, it's comforting and serene and peaceful and good.  I want to dissolve on a bed of flowers. All's stony, everything is further apart. I don't know I don't know I don't know.
