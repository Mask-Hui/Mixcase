At times people have to stand up for themselves, to stand up for what they believe in and let whatever happens, happen. This is one of the philosophies I live by, for some the courage to live this way is hard to come by. It may be hard at first, but once the path is walked it gets easier every time.  This does not mean however that foolish actions should be performed, consequences naturally follow. No one seeks scars, at least scars of the mind. Scars of the flesh fade into memory, then become no more than a decoration to be admired. Scars of the mind weep blood for all time... forever fresh until buried in the dungeons of the mind. No mind should need a dungeon, seek not scars but the path of life you wish to walk. Consider carefully the paths, for the one which may look appealing at the entrance may be covered with pitfalls and serpeants further down the path.  Choose carefully your path.... let it not lead into a dungeon of continual hurt.
