Ok i think i am falling for someone all over again. I thought i might be over him but i know i was wrong. I tried so hard to get over him but it never works. He sucks so bad. He just makes me like him more and more everytime we hang out. Maybe we should stop hanging out. I dunno. I love his smile. I have a thing about smiles and ears. And i like both of his. I thought i was falling for someone else as well but he told me to forget about him and just keep liking the original person. He doesn't think i could ever like him.
