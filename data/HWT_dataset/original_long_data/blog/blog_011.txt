yes...i am a comment whore...i admit it. &nbsp; but now ... holy whoppin whoa!!! my dad just called me up to say we just got some new pets!! isn't that freakish? but of course i won't totally believe it until i see them for myself but....i'm excited!! though our last pet experience wasn't that great. the fish incident: we have this trio of fish right. and everything is fine and dandy for a while. then one day my sister decides she wants to put a little plastic mermaid in the fish tank. seems harmless enough. but it turns out the color is toxic and it poisons one of the fish, and it dies. sounds bad right? yeah it gets worse. then we have to clean out the tank...so we do that, and it's going well until my dad accidentally fills the tank up with scorching (yes i am exaggerating) hot water. and the rest of them die too. yes. sad but true. maybe we'll have better luck with these. we got a birdie and a guinea pig. sounds fun. YAY!! haha my sister was the one who called me...hehe.  yeah i don't think i'm supposed to be getting personal calls at work but haha yesterday my dad called me to tell me to look at a car on ebay. my dad cracks me up. oh yes and i joined jonathan's forum today...and i don't completely understand how it works, and it's sad. and i feel stupid. but i will get the hang of it one day. i really want to go home. andy's having a thing tonight. and if all goes well kellye who i haven't seen in ages will be visiting tomorrow. and that will all be neat. &nbsp; yeah. &nbsp; i swear one of these days i WILL have something to say. &nbsp;
