I forgot to mention yesterday that mike only has one more week until his tri. It's on monday, memorial day. He's supposed to be taking it easy this week, but i don't see him having the ability to take it too easy. What would he do with all that extra energy? most days, he has more energy than should be humanly possible. Yesterday was the best monday ever! we started our workout with a 10 mile bike yesterday. The wind was pretty rough, but we survived! much less, we finished with our sanity. After biking, i decided to do a bike/run transition. This is also known as a 'brick'. They say this term is used because your legs will be hard as bricks if you do this very often. My interpretation of a 'brick' is that my legs are as heavy as bricks when jumping off the bike and starting a run. I haven't done a brick in a while, and i was planning to swim after, so i decided on a mile run. It's crazy how hard this is! my body seriously feels like my weight has doubled! i somehow survived my mile. Next we headed to swim class. I was nervous that i had used all of my energy on my bike/run, but somehow found all kinds of extra energy for a great swim. We swam for about an hour or more yesterday, although i can't remember how far...i've slept since then. This was the first day i've ever actually done a swim/bike/run all in the same day (not in that order though). My body is pretty tired today, but i need to be working super hard the next two weeks. I also got up bright and early this morning and got my swim in for the day. I swam for about 45 mins this morning, i must be really tired because i can't seem to remember how much i swam this morning either...
