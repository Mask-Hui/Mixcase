I bathed Zoey tonight. She looks like a big head on top of a tiny body. At least she smells fresh and clean!   Madonna is no longer Madonna. She is Esther now. Please update this information in your palm pilots. I would except that I don't use a palm pilot. I hate them.   I'm looking to rent some movies that will make me cry this weekend. I'm in the mood for some good tear jerkers. Any suggestions? I have 'Stella' on hand just in case. That one always gets me. My Friday night plans are as follows:  -Come home from work  -Walk dog  -Put on comfy 'apartment pants'  -order food  -watch depressing movies that will make me cry  -cry  -blow nose repeatedly  -make microwave popcorn  -check e-mail  -watch more depressing movies  -cry more  -blow nose even more  -go to bed   Sometimes a girl just needs a night to herself to 'recharge'.   I am involved in a work related 'Fox and Sox' performance at South Street Seaport on Saturday. Please avoid seeing me be 'Seussical' at all costs. Unless you have small children and are interested in a CMOM membership.
