I bathed zoey tonight. She looks like a big head on top of a tiny body. At least she smells fresh and clean! madonna is no longer madonna. She is esther now. Please update this information in your palm pilots. I would except that i don't use a palm pilot. I hate them. I'm looking to rent some movies that will make me cry this weekend. I'm in the mood for some good tear jerkers. Any suggestions? i have 'stella' on hand just in case. That one always gets me. My friday night plans are as follows: -come home from work -walk dog -put on comfy 'apartment pants' -order food -watch depressing movies that will make me cry -cry -blow nose repeatedly -make microwave popcorn -check e-mail -watch more depressing movies -cry more -blow nose even more -go to bed sometimes a girl just needs a night to herself to 'recharge'. I am involved in a work related 'fox and sox' performance at south street seaport on saturday. Please avoid seeing me be 'seussical' at all costs. Unless you have small children and are interested in a cmom membership.
