Have i told you how much i despise fashion? [coming from the yearbooks freshman 'most fashionable'] i am so serious. Its evil, yet so addicting. It's something i totally strugle with. At cyt camp my mom sent me a package with a teen vogue and lucky mag in it. Karsen was like 'wow!! your mom loves you!' people who love me don't tempt me with fashion magazines. I know my mom didn't know..but still. See, there was a time when i was obsessed with fashion. Like so obsessed i would check style.com every day. Multiple times a day just to make sure i was on top of all the trends. This was not a long time ago..november of last year. I started to see all the models. I know you hear this a lot how people 'compare themselves to anorexic models' i heard it so much. I never thought it happened to real people. Even though i only weighed a hundred and fifteen pounds i still thought i was fat. I tried to loose weight and got down to 105. But i still wasn't happy. All those models always look so happy. Now, over six months later, i finally realize how unhappy they really are. There smiles are like a canvas they paint on every day. I was slowly becoming one of them... I was so sad. I tried and i tried but no guy would ever like me. No modeling agency would ever want me. No one would ever want me as there friend. I felt so unwanted. Later i realized how foolish i was being. Really, i looked way better at my normal 120 pounds. God slowly seeped into my life in ways i still do not understand. For some reason i would start to pick up my bible instead of lucky magazine. Soon, my reading of lucky was extint. Along with vogue and every other fashion magazine. Still, it remains a struggle. I love fashion, i admit i do. But there is so much more than the crap media wants to sell you. So, my friend, stay away from fashion magazines! throw them in the trash! burn 'em!! never make the mistake i did, ok?
