My daughter is 3 1/2 years old. She is almost a vegetarian. The only meat she will eat is chicken, and that is only sometimes. She drinks lots of milk (24-30 oz a day). For comparrison, most doctors recommend that growing teenagers get about that same amount. She also usually will eat cheese when it is offered, and she eats a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch. Most of her calories are coming from bread, fruit, and vegetables. My questions is this, how do vegetarians get the protein they need? i know that soy (tofu) is a good source, but i really doubt she will eat it. I only eat it when it is in hot & sour soup, so i also would have no idea how to offer it to her. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated
