Sorry I haven't posted in a while guys. I've been getting up early to either meet movers, cleaners, etc. to move my grandpa to his assisted living apartment. We moved him yesterday, and he did ok, but we're going to have to bump up his 'Care level' starting monday.  So anywho, I'm interested to hear your analysis of Drunks With Guns and I must concur that any Pepsi product sucks. I have decided that MSN messenger and ICQ are evil. I need to add that to my long list of things that evil. Whelp I'm off to go hang out with some friends, later peeps.
