Hi levengals!!! hope everyone had a great christmas! i sure did, though i must admit i'm glad it's over. Had lots of people over christmas and then the day after also. I'm a little tired of cooking and cleaning the kitchen but it was well worth the effort to spend the holidays with family and friends. Got some 'shining things' from hubby for christmas, i must have been very good this year. Lol! got to see tricky ricky on christmas eve while baking. Hubba hubba. It had been so long since i had seen him i had almost forgotten that he was such a hottie. Lol also saw adam today. Can't remember the story he was covering, his cute smiling face sucked all rational thoughts from my brain. Lol almost made up for being shep-less the last week. Sherry - congrats on the weight loss!!!!! i haven't gained any weight in quite awhile, but i seem to be at a plateau that's keeping me from losing. Drats - well, guess i'll just have to give up food as a new year's resolution. Nat - ohhh, a new couch and tv, that's great!! logan was in fresno staying with brendon on the day of the earthquake, he felt it but brendon didn't. Go figure! guess some people are more intuned to mother nature than others. Haven't felt any of the aftershocks though. Congrats to your stepson - hope she said 'yes'!!!
