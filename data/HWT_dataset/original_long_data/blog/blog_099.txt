I can't believe how long it's been since I've written.  I did go to the temple with the girl who called me!  We had a very lovely time and she got the association of many very advanced devotees, besides being able to listen to Bir Krsna Maharaj give class.  It was important to me that she hear him speak, especially since it was on my first trip to the temple that I met my spiritual master, and because for some reason, Maharaj is not usually at the temple when I visit, and this time he was.  So I was glad that she had this opportunity.  I am continuing to see some response from the ad, so I expect to continue it as time goes on.  Additionally, I am going to get involved in some small way with one of the bhakti-vrksa groups in Hillsborough, so that will be some training for me in how to help people who are coming newly to Krsna Consciousness.  I am looking forward to it because my grasp of the philosophy is not very good.  So I am hoping to learn and become a little qualified to help other people.
