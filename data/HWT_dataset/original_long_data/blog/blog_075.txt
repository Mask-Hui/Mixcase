My mother then went to boot camp. Not the regular one that you've seen in the movies, this is for ncos. They learned to march in a straight line and to fire a 9mm. At this point my mom was okay, but then came the day that she had to learn to repel. Somehow she got her self upside down and then she started to panic yelling for the instructor to come and help her out. My mother cried and said that she didn't want to die. Well about half an hour later with the instructor ready to go awol she made it right side up and down the side of the wall. Needless to say my mother has never repelled again.
