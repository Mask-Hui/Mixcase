Ever have one of those days when you just don't know what the... What the... Anything? no? well then you should skip the rest of this because it won't make any sense to you. To those of you choosing to continue on i offer the following observation. ' sometimes i wish i'd been given the manual .' manuals, if done correctly at least, let you know: what things are for, what they can do, how they do the things they do, what happens if you push button x or y, what to do if things aren't doing what they're supposed to the phone number and email address of the omniscient guru who can solve every problem very useful information. Unfortunately i didn't get a manual with me. So: i'm not entirely sure what i'm here for, i have a pretty good idea of what i can do but only in as much as i know what i've done and based on that i can surmise what other things i am able to do but i suspect there are a myriad of other things out there that i could be doing that i'm just not aware of i have only a general understanding of how it is i manage to do things, or rather, it still seems somewhat magical that my body works and the inner workings of my brain are a complete mystery i think i know what will happen when my buttons get pushed but i'm often surprised by what does and what doesn't sets me off if i'm not working correctly i have a few solutions: sleep, water, food, exercise, seeking medical treatment, seeking psychological advice, ignoring the problem until it goes away - and though usually a combination of these will work, it's trial and error at best damned if i can find a guru who can solve even some of the problems so here's the place where you'd hope i'd come up with some solution for not having the manual. Sorry. Plenty of folks have tried and the results have been mixed at best; i'm not sure that the world is ready for fundamentalist karlsenism.
