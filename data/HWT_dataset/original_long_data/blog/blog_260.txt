Oh my god.... My buddy at work lent me the dvds of seasons 1 & 2 of trailer park boys. Apparently it plays on showcase (the channel) and if you haven't seen it, it's a godamn riot. I only watched 2 episodes so far and i laughed so hard i was crying. Bubbles is the best character. His glasses are so thick he might as well be wearing magnifying lenses. Check blockbuster for it or go buy it, it's good if you need to laugh and i really needed to laugh this week. Oh looky outside... More f*cking shit weather. Imagine that. Summer my ass. I don't care if we get a maximum of 20 degrees during the whole summer, just keep the godamn rain in the prairies where the want/need it. I just want the weekend to be here. Not that anything exciting is planned; jen wants to go see the new harry potter movie. Oh f*ck me, i just remembered i have to finish some reading for my iid course. Gotta cut this short again. Until the next adventure.
