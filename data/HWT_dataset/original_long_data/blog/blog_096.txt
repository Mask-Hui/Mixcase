Call for officials! okay, gentle readers... Here's the deal. I want you to become an 'official' of this weblog. There is no real responsibility for the office you will hold, except that you stop by once in awhile, which you probably do already. You get to choose the office you wish to hold, unless it has already been taken by someone else. For example, urllink mark morris is the official iowan . Today, i am pleased to announce the naming of two additional officials. Today i name my urllink mom the urllink official mom of journey inside my mind because she's my urllink mom :d. Urllink ireneq asked me to pick an office for her to hold, so i've come up with something that i think will fit nicely: the urllink official introspectional blogger . If you read her blog with any frequency, then you'll understand. So, let's hear it for the officials! urllink official iowan urllink official blogger of introspection urllink official mom
