im so dead   juz toked to E's best fren again, who on my behalf, had tested E out..... lets juz quote verbatim wat e best fren told me:  'of u.... she say fren lor... she dun c anythin more... den i askd if she can sense anythin la... she say no la... dun tink it's anythin more.... dowan b too sensitive n oso she dun tink shld haf anythin more.'  as if this wasnt bad enuf...  'Ok she like tall guys... 1.7o or 1.75 tt kinda ht... n i keep saying she so short stil wan so tall for wat... haha Den she wants some1 who is more experienced... got r/ship b4 1... dowan a greenhorn... n now she has diz thing for manly pple rather than boyish....'  to say its a major blow for my self-esteem is juz e least of it....... feeling a whole range of emotions rite now.... from bitterness, anger, frustration... to disappointment, sorrow, (self-loathing maybe?)... im not angry wif E... juz wif e cruelty of life n e arbitrariness of my God-given attributes... i've been given talents ppl wld be envious of for e rest of their lives, juz as much as i've not been given things dat i'd like to have but can neva attain.... e sorrow is of e fact dat i have to look at her from now on n see her as something dats literally so near, n yet so far...  im not e type who can instantly turn ard n say dat ppl like E dun ever deserve me.... superfiicality n looks shldnt matter... blahblah... cos as much as it helps u feel better, its only a half-truth... for wks i have sincerely believed dat i do deserve her, n she does deserve me... i had neva wanted anything more... n yes, lets not kid ourselves dat looks dun matter, cos they do... i noe dat cos im juz like E, n juz like most ppl who can see...  physical appearances does matter (in e short-run anyway)... ok, not dat im freaky-looking, but i muz admit i failed all e criteria she laid out there in 1 sentence...  time will heal everything... dats true... juz hope dat e next time, something will werk out... meanwhile, i shall go back into my shell n wait it out...  of cos, to have everything else in e world except luv, makes me wanna exchange everything for dat luv alone... Tis' the futile road to be travelled, by those blessed with many riches but cursed with lifelong loneliness...
