So its not REALLY hooky, but I've been accumulating sub-days and decided to cash one in today, Wednesday the 10th in Japan (the post-time gives the U.S. date, so its technically not correct), so I can just goof-off for a couple of days.  Nothing like 48 hours of daydreaming to get ones creative energy back.  I have it good for a forgeiner, and my timing was good, too.  The illustration part is the icing on the cake.  I'd probably complain more if that didn't fall in my lap.  I know I am getting ripped off, though.  I'm not blind to that fact. Getting hungry.  Might go get some Mexican food at Speak Easy, the 'American Style' diner just across the street from the post office in my little prefecture.  They fly an Amercian flag outside of it, so you know its GOT to be 'American style'.  It was faded and a little rotten until they replaced it recently with a bright new one.  Think I'll try to catch CNN before the general news updates are over.  Today, I'm staying in the house and working on the web.  I have all day tomorrow to explore Kyoto some more.
