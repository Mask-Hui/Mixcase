Im so dead juz toked to e's best fren again, who on my behalf, had tested e out..... Lets juz quote verbatim wat e best fren told me: 'of u.... She say fren lor... She dun c anythin more... Den i askd if she can sense anythin la... She say no la... Dun tink it's anythin more.... Dowan b too sensitive n oso she dun tink shld haf anythin more.' as if this wasnt bad enuf... 'ok she like tall guys... 1.7o or 1.75 tt kinda ht... N i keep saying she so short stil wan so tall for wat... Haha den she wants some1 who is more experienced... Got r/ship b4 1... Dowan a greenhorn... N now she has diz thing for manly pple rather than boyish....' to say its a major blow for my self-esteem is juz e least of it....... Feeling a whole range of emotions rite now.... From bitterness, anger, frustration... To disappointment, sorrow, (self-loathing maybe?)... Im not angry wif e... Juz wif e cruelty of life n e arbitrariness of my god-given attributes... I've been given talents ppl wld be envious of for e rest of their lives, juz as much as i've not been given things dat i'd like to have but can neva attain.... E sorrow is of e fact dat i have to look at her from now on n see her as something dats literally so near, n yet so far... Im not e type who can instantly turn ard n say dat ppl like e dun ever deserve me.... Superfiicality n looks shldnt matter... Blahblah... Cos as much as it helps u feel better, its only a half-truth... For wks i have sincerely believed dat i do deserve her, n she does deserve me... I had neva wanted anything more... N yes, lets not kid ourselves dat looks dun matter, cos they do... I noe dat cos im juz like e, n juz like most ppl who can see... Physical appearances does matter (in e short-run anyway)... Ok, not dat im freaky-looking, but i muz admit i failed all e criteria she laid out there in 1 sentence... Time will heal everything... Dats true... Juz hope dat e next time, something will werk out... Meanwhile, i shall go back into my shell n wait it out... Of cos, to have everything else in e world except luv, makes me wanna exchange everything for dat luv alone... Tis' the futile road to be travelled, by those blessed with many riches but cursed with lifelong loneliness...
