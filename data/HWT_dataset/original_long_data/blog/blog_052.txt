The debate of the summer season... Is it to-may-toe? or to-mah-toe? awwwww my fluffy princess steven and i had the cutest argument in the world.. Which kept me giggling non-stop. He says to-mah-toe... But not po-tah-toe.. Awwww and he also says pass-tah instead of pasta. I love my princess so much. He's so adorable. And i'll kill anyone that says any different. I'm serious, i'll hunt you down, and rape your ass with a rifle, and as you are about to oragsm, i will pull the trigger.. At least you'll go out of this world somewhat pleasured.. I know it will be pleasurable to me to kill anyone that says anything against my fluffy princess, or me.. Or us. Grrrrr. All of you douches that don't know what the fuck love feels like... Its the most amazing thing in the world. So silly.. And fun. And intense. And god its amazing. It keeps you floating. I just might even change the way i say tomato... That.. Is a big commitment to make. I love you my fluffy princess. [2008 is the best year in the world.]
