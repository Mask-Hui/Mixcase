Tonight, as a record number of Canadians sit down in front of their TV to watch Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final and cheer on the  urlLink Calgary Flames , I am amazed.  In my lifetime I cannot remember one Canadian NHL team getting this much national support in the playoffs.  Ever.  Is it due to the fact that it has been 20 years since the Stanley Cup has had a Canadian address?  I'm sure that has been a definite factor.  However, there is another aspect to this that cannot be denied ... Canadians have fallen in love with the City of Calgary, the fans, and most importantly, the team.  How can you not love a city that lights a natural gas flame on top of a landmark building and leaves it burning for every playoff game?   How can you not love fans that sell out the Pengrowth Saddledome even when the Flames are playing 'away?'  Or fans who, failing to luck out for tickets to the actual game, begin lining up outside favourite sports bars at 8am in order to get a seat there?  And, failing even that, line the streets of 'The Red Mile,' so that they can cheer on their heroes together?  And then, after each and every game, partying into the wee hours of the morning.  All of them wearing red, all of them wearing smiles, and all of them madly in love with the Flames ...  The Calgary Flames ... underdog of all underdogs.  One of the lowest paid and hardest hitting teams in the league.  Even with every single one of their players healthy, nobody expected them to get this far, and they are all FAR from healthy.  With key defenseman out on the injured list and a decimated, rookie defense corps they still continue to win, continue to play as a team and for the team.  And they continue to have Canadians far and wide, fall just a little more in love with them each day.     Calgary Flames flag shares honours atop the Canadian Embassy in Washington, D.C. (AP photo)
