Welcome to my first Blog.  I'm going to use this as my site for views on the world, technological advancements, political views and random rants as time permits.  I invite and encourage any and all viewpoints and will respond to as many of them as I can, just keep it clean and on the subject being discussed and we'll all get along fine!  Just a little about myself.  I am a 23 year old Australian with a great deal of time on my hands to think, despite studying a Bachelor of Education full time.  My interests are varied and I have a sort of amateur jack-of-all-trades knowledge of a lot of things.  So feel free to tell me if I get something wrong, it won't be the first or last time I am wrong, so bear with me.    I'd really like to encourage the interest of those with political ideas (not ideals or fanaticism) to discuss their thoughts as I have some of my own ideas for a new form of governance.  I'd also like to have a scientific forum occur debating the uses and value of new technologies as they are researched and become available without the windy moralising attached to such technologies as genetic engineering by most in the scientific community seem to be doing.  So this is it, hopefully a blog that will stimulate thought, conversation and maybe a debate or two.   Till l8r! xag
