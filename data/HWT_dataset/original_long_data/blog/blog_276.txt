Last night booth, taylor, artie and i saw harry potter. I was so excited, but it didn't end up being as good as i'd hoped. But it was still good, and that harry potter...he's dreamy. Hahaha. Taylor claims to be a faithful ron lover, but i saw her eyeing my man harry last night. I told artie it was ok if he wants to have a crush on hermoine cause i have a crush on harry, but he didn't want to. Oh well. Man, i'm a loser. Wow, i just looked at my watch and realized that in three months to the day i will be leaving for college. Thats crazy business. I'm so excited but at the same time i dont think the reality of college has set in yet. I think once i get there i'll miss home a lot more than i think i will right now. It's going to be so different, but i can't wait. The end of the year is just dragging on. I feel like i haven't had a real day of school in forever. All i do in my ap's is watch movies, my papers been done for 5 days, and besides that i have frees. I have to come in one period during all of finals week and it's just to watch a movie. Can i just graduate now? soon enough... This week god really showed me something that my sister has always told me, but i never believed. I realized that i hold way to high of expectations for my friends, especially those who i'm closest to. And it always ends up hurting me, and then i go and cry to my sister and she tells me every time it's because i expect more out of people then is right. And it's so true, i need to learn to be realistic and not think anyones perfect, because no one is. I need to be more accepting of flaws and realize more of my own and work on those. It feels good to finally realize it on my own, now i just have to fix it.
