Last night Booth, Taylor, Artie and I saw Harry Potter.  I was so excited, but it didn't end up being as good as I'd hoped.  But it was still good, and that Harry Potter...he's dreamy. hahaha.  Taylor claims to be a faithful Ron lover, but I saw her eyeing my man Harry last night.  I told Artie it was ok if he wants to have a crush on Hermoine cause I have a crush on Harry, but he didn't want to.  Oh well.  Man, I'm a loser.    Wow, I just looked at my watch and realized that in three months to the day I will be leaving for college.  Thats crazy business.  I'm so excited but at the same time I dont think the reality of college has set in yet.  I think once I get there I'll miss home a lot more than I think I will right now.  It's going to be so different, but I can't wait.  The end of the year is just dragging on.  I feel like I haven't had a real day of school in forever.  All I do in my ap's is watch movies, my papers been done for 5 days, and besides that I have frees.  I have to come in one period during all of finals week and it's just to watch a movie.  Can I just graduate now? Soon enough...  This week God really showed me something that my sister has always told me, but I never believed.  I realized that I hold way to high of expectations for my friends, especially those who I'm closest to.  And it always ends up hurting me, and then I go and cry to my sister and she tells me every time it's because I expect more out of people then is right.  And it's so true, I need to learn to be realistic and not think anyones perfect, because no one is.  I need to be more accepting of flaws and realize more of my own and work on those.  It feels good to finally realize it on my own, now I just have to fix it.
