Hello levengals!!! okay whoever has my adam needs to return him right now. I haven't seen him in awhile. I haven't seen where anyone else has mentioned seeing him either. At least i have got to see rick and jeff. That will hold me over until adam returns. Nan - do you have adam?? lmao!!! jayel - thanks for the hottie alerts. I saw jeff today. It looked really cold there. Teri - i hope you are feeling better. I also agree that it was great to see our president visit the troops. You could tell how excited they all were for him to be there. Nat - welcome back. How is the ankle?? okay ladies guess where i'm going on the 11th-14th. New york city. I'm so excited. We are staying in new jersey but our hotel has a shuttle that takes us to time square. It was about $100 a night cheaper to stay there then to stay in the city. I'm going to go by the fox studio and at least take some pictures of me there. I might try to go on saturday while fox and friends is on and maybe i can look in the window. I know in the summer they do a lot outside but i guess they won't be doing that in december. Maybe i'll see someone coming and going. Well gotta go. Talk to you ladies later.
