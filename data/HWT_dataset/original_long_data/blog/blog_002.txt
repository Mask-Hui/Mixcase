Hello Levengals!!!  Okay whoever has my Adam needs to return him right now.  I haven't seen him in awhile.  I haven't seen where anyone else has mentioned seeing him either.   At least I have got to see Rick and Jeff.  That will hold me over until Adam returns.    Nan - Do you have Adam?? LMAO!!!  Jayel - Thanks for the hottie alerts.  I saw Jeff today.  It looked really cold there.   Teri - I hope you are feeling better.    I also agree that it was great to see our President visit the troops.  You could tell how excited they all were for him to be there.  Nat - Welcome back.  How is the ankle??  Okay ladies guess where I'm going on the 11th-14th.  New York City.  I'm so excited.  We are staying in New Jersey but our hotel has a shuttle that takes us to time square.  It was about $100 a night cheaper to stay there then to stay in the city.  I'm going to go by the Fox studio and at least take some pictures of me there.  I might try to go on Saturday while Fox and Friends is on and maybe I can look in the window.    I know in the summer they do a lot outside but I guess they won't be doing that in December.   Maybe I'll see someone coming and going.     Well gotta go.  Talk to you ladies later.
