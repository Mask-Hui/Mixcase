Went to visit U of I this weekend.  Lots happened, had tons of fun, missed being a college kid.  I miss my party friends more than I thought I did, and I missed my good friends even more.  This led me to visit Elliot's old column (my gangster film ta and overall good friend). His last column made me sad, yet there's not much else to do now.  Work is work (and work sucks btw) and today I downloaded the application to VCU.  Ha.  We'll see how far I get with that.  UFL is still an option - a viable one - and unless I begin to love this job it might be one I'm checking out more than I thought I would.  Basically, today is a day of missing and reflection it seems.  Def not work conducive.    In unrelated news, I miss my pooh bear.  That is all.
