Feelin' Pretty Good   For the first time in an awful long time, I woke up feeling pretty good. I was out of bed around 9am and spent a lot of the day playing around on the PC and watching TV. I also managed to do some more cleaning in my bedroom. Believe it or not, I  finally  folded the clothes that have been sitting in my room (in a clothesbasket) for weeks, months perhaps! My room is still a mess though. The problem is, I need more storage space and I have none. I either have to get rid of stuff or stack it up.   I called my friend Rob today and told him about the upcoming gig. He told me he missed the last one because he got dizzy right before he was supposed to leave. Ok. Hopefully he'll make the next one, if we're definitely on for it, which still hasn't been confirmed yet. He said his neighbor showed up at the last one, but I didn't see her there.   It was a little cooler in the house today... just a little. The skies would fluctuate between clear and overcast all day long, there was even thunder and lightning at one point, which looked promising, but alas, there was no rain. I wish it would rain soon, it's been too damned hot lately (in the 90's).  Tomorrow Mom is off and we're going to do some running around. I'm going to apply for a very good job tomorrow, and I may put in a few applications elsewhere too (I gotta get workin'). Wish me luck!
