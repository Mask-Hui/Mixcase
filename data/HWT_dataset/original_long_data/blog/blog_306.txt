The word of the day is tired.  I'm fucking tired tonight. Tired from busting my ass at work and only hearing that I don't do enough around the house. Fuck this shit.  I am also tired of women (for the most part). I am mainly tired of being made to think I am at their mercy (which, more often than not, I am). I am tired of  feeling too depressed in my down time from work to do anything other than wait by the phone like a patient lapdog.  Why do I even put up with this bullshit?  Oh yeah. Now I remember.  I wasn't always this big a pussy. I often miss not giving a shit about anyone but myself. I was the biggest hardass I knew. Now look how the mighty have fallen. And I must have fallen really hard because the notion of rising again is nowhere in sight. Damn it.
