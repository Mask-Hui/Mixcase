The word of the day is tired. I'm fucking tired tonight. Tired from busting my ass at work and only hearing that i don't do enough around the house. Fuck this shit. I am also tired of women (for the most part). I am mainly tired of being made to think i am at their mercy (which, more often than not, i am). I am tired of feeling too depressed in my down time from work to do anything other than wait by the phone like a patient lapdog. Why do i even put up with this bullshit? oh yeah. Now i remember. I wasn't always this big a pussy. I often miss not giving a shit about anyone but myself. I was the biggest hardass i knew. Now look how the mighty have fallen. And i must have fallen really hard because the notion of rising again is nowhere in sight. Damn it.
