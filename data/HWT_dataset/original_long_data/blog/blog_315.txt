I wonder why when things are over we sometimes forget the bad parts...for example...  For each childbirth and labor, I can remember feeling alot of pain, but I don't remember what the pain felt like.  I can remember thinking that I didn't want to have another child, each of the three times, but that was at the time.   I think that is what it is though.  We have some human quality that prevents us from remembering pain...whether it be child birth or perhaps relationship woes...I mean relationship in general, not just love/couple things, but every relationship.  I think that for most of us, that is how we continue to go on and live life.  Random thoughts, I know.  Oh, but on the upside...I have a wonderful family.  Thank God for that because at this age I realized that they are the ones that I can count on forever.
