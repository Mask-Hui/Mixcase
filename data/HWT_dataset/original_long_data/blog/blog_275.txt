Michael: This is not just a personal vendetta against one action by Sophia, this is a late reaction to a month of on and off bitchy behavior  Sophia:  I'm sorry if I've offended you, but you really have been different, and I'm not the only person around you that's noticed, but whether this is just a stupid Marten Paranoia thing or not, I'd like to keep it offline.  I'd also appreciate it if you didn't blatantly insult my friends online.  Nate:  um... yeah.... girls are weird. Whats the point of calling it a laptop if your not supposed to use it on your lap?
