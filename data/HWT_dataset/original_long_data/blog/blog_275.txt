Michael: this is not just a personal vendetta against one action by sophia, this is a late reaction to a month of on and off bitchy behavior sophia: i'm sorry if i've offended you, but you really have been different, and i'm not the only person around you that's noticed, but whether this is just a stupid marten paranoia thing or not, i'd like to keep it offline. I'd also appreciate it if you didn't blatantly insult my friends online. Nate: um... Yeah.... Girls are weird. Whats the point of calling it a laptop if your not supposed to use it on your lap?
