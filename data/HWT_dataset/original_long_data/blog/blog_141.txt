At the moment i can't even think of my dad without crying. I'm so mad at him, but the stupid thing is, he didn't do anything wrong. He's just telling me what to do like he's supposed to. But i hate it. I love my dad, he's a great guy, but i always dread that time when he comes in the house because i don't know if he'll be in a good mood or a bad one, or if he'll lecture me again on how i have to do so much better at everything then my other siblings, or how i can do something stupid, or just something that i can't handle him saying to me. I remember once when he said something to me that really upset me and he freaked out and said, 'can't i even talk to my kids without them crying?!' sorry... I'm too tired to cry, but i am. I'm such and idiot. I wish i could have gone back with my brother and eri. I should have gone to church this morning with my mom. I was thinking about it but she would have been gone before i got to her. I should go back to studying before my sister wakes up and sees me crying. =lee current music = none current eats = i think i just ate a cupcake current mood = confused, frustrated, furious, depressed, stressed, all of the above
