Location: Prague, Czech Republic Accommodation: Clown &amp; Bard Hostel, only 5 dorm beds, but with 3 very messy German boys Number of McDonald's I've already seen: 3 Most exciting thing about Prague: The  urlLink cow parade  is here! Yay!  I arrived in Prague this afternoon after a lovely train ride in from Bratislava, Slovakia (my train even had air conditioning! a novelty). I met a French girl at the hostel last night who was going the same way, and it's always nice to have company as a lone traveler.  This is my last stop, and I intend to make the most of it, which is why I'm staying in a notorious party hostel with its own pub.  My last few days in Dubrovnik were nice, even if Lauren and Andrea did leave early therefore slightly messing up my plans. But nevermind, I met nice Aussies at Mama's (the private house I was staying in), and all was good.  Does anyone know anything about dermatology out there? If you do, please email me. Here's what I've got: Day 1: red blotches on my thighs, no big deal Day 3: they start to turn bright red and blister, with big puffy white centers, they kind of hurt Day 6: today, I have them on my back, stomach, other leg, and, other unfortunate places that makes it a bit uncomfortable to sit down.  What the hell do I have? I went to the pharmacy and she had no idea, but did give me some sort of cream. Who knows what it really is, since it's all written in Slovakian. I've done extensive searches on the internet, and the closest thing I found is a stinging seaweed that surfers seem to know about. What if I have some strange Croatian disease? They told me it was safe to drink the water, and I believed them!  Well, let's hope by the next entry it's cleared up because it's a bit uncomfortable and it looks a little scary. There's an American Medical clinic, I might end up there. But first I'll be taking an organized city tour tomorrow leaving from the hostel. I have priorities.
