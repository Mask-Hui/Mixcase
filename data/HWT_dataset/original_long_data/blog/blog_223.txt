I made $10 today! i made it not by getting suckered into another mlm scam. Nor did i make it by sending money to some guy who charges a outrageous price for their stuff. I made it by selling something i had sitting on my hard drive for over a year. Something i have the resell rights to, but couldn't figure out how to make it unique enough for people to want...until now. It's a set of reports on urllink advertising telling how to get advertising and how to write ads. If anyone here's interested in reading it there's a plain text version included. Oddly enough, this didn't sell on any mlm or affliiate site, but on palmgear. If you clicked on the link you'll have found that out by now. The reports are in palm format so that people who download it can take it with them and read it on the bus or train or anywhere else. I've got a dozen more files like this to work on. Hopefully this is the beginning of something really good.
