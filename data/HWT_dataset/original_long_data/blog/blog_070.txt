'jessica' (3:28) jessica is always taking chances getting by on rotten circumstances she's painting visions of a better life i wish i could save her tonight but she's happier not giving in office spaces never fit her skin jessica when will you begin? will you ever win? someone said they saw jess a week ago but i don't think she'd want us to know that she's working like a slave for her self and her master is whipping her to death chorus i saw you last night and you walked away from me again a friend came to me and said you were afraid of what i'd say you got stuck in the vein and you lost your head if i see you tonight i'll take you home chorus - so thats a song by seville. And it's title is my name. :-d and the song fits me well.-
