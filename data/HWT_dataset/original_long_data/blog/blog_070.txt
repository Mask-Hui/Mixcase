'Jessica' (3:28)    Jessica is always taking chances Getting by on rotten circumstances She's painting visions of a better life I wish I could save her tonight  But she's happier not giving in Office spaces never fit her skin Jessica when will you begin? Will you ever win?  Someone said they saw Jess a week ago But I don't think she'd want us to know That she's working like a slave for her self And her master is whipping her to death  Chorus  I saw you last night And you walked away from me again A friend came to me And said you were afraid of what I'd say You got stuck in the vein And you lost your head If I see you tonight I'll take you home Chorus   - so thats a song by seville. and it's title is my name. :-D and the song fits me well.-
