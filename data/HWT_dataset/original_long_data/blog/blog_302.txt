Omg i have been so busy with summer school this summer . . . I guess that's what you get for being a bad girl all year! so i just decided to kick back and have a pool party with my girlfriends. I need a study break! the thing is, with all the storms we've been having, part of the neighbor's tree fell down, and now i think he can see over the fence into my backyard from his upstairs window . . . And i've caught him sneaking a peek through the fence at me while i'm sunbathing nude . . . More than a few times . . . He is such a peeping tom!! so do i tell my girlfriends, who might not want to get peeped on, or do i leave my binoculars hanging on his front door knob?? what do you think?? anybody want to help me out, my keen # is 1-800-to-flirt ex 0370346 . . .
