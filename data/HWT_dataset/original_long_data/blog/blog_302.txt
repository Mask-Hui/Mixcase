OMG I have been so busy with summer school this summer . . . I guess that's what you get for being a bad girl all year!  So I just decided to kick back and have a pool party with my girlfriends.  I need a study break!  The thing is, with all the storms we've been having, part of the neighbor's tree fell down, and now I think he can see over the fence into my backyard from his upstairs window . . . and I've caught him sneaking a peek through the fence at me while I'm sunbathing nude . . . MORE than a few times . . . he is such a PEEPING TOM!!  So do I tell my girlfriends, who might not want to get peeped on, or do I leave my binoculars hanging on his front door knob??  What do you think??  Anybody want to help me out, my Keen # is 1-800-TO-FLIRT ex 0370346 . . . OXOXMisty
