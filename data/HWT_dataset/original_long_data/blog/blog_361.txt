One For The Money, Yessir.    I must have said the word 'cock' (in some form or another) at least 200 times today.  No shit.  Sometimes it was 'cock biter' or the more formal 'cock bite'  notice the subtle differences.  Mostly it was just plain old 'cock'.  Ginny's seen me like this before, where I'll just call everyone and everything a cock.  If you were to ask my manager how many times I called him a cock today he wouldn't be able to remember because the number is higher than Sir Edmund Hillary standing on a ladder, snorting cocaine.  It's not that I loves the cock as much as it is that I loves the word cock.  Just like how it's not Jared that loves the cock so much as it is his mouth that loves the cock.  At least that's what Shawn told me.  Fucking cock-smokers.  I must have cock on the brain.  Again, not  actual  cock, just the word 'cock'.  I think you folks have had enough cock for one day, so let's move on.  The 'girl' came back in today.  You know the one.  I figured out why she talks that way, she's deaf.  I kind of felt like a shit-ass today, looking at her and thinking about what I wrote.  It wasn't remorse, but it was something.  I have no problem making fun of people, especially not cripples, minorities, old people, ugly babies, chicks with itty bitty tittes, or, God help them, disgusting hippies.  I guess it's because I have no social interaction with these people.  But I've been helping this girl for two days now and I have talked to her quite a bit, she's really nice and pretty funny, and now I kind of (just a little) feel like a shit-ass.  Somewhere there's a light side Jedi Master who still has hope for me.  I wonder if I'm losing my edge...  You guys would tell me if I was off my game right?  I couldn't stand just being 'a little condescending' or 'barely an asshole'.  It's all or nothing, baby.  Fuck you cocks.
