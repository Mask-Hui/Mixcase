Well i finished my bm lisan but sadly ive lost my 2week old thumb drive..i think..sigh..i better buy the same 1 again so dad wont think ive lost it and crap..sigh..my money! but im not so sad..sigh though.. Anyway did not go to school..i woke up at 5am and couldnt sleep and was up all the way to 7am plus and i felt fine to go to school..but thought nothing much would be happening and that id likely be risking making myself feel worse..anyway i finaly slept at 8 something and woke up at 10 or 11...did my bm lisan work and then after school i went and did my test...eheheh!now im finished! :d well its abt 11pm..and damn sleeping sounds like a very interesting thing to do now so chaloz!
