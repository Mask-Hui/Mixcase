Like really?  I am so depressed right now.  I am so fucking angry and bitter and sad and fucking hell writing it out changes nothing, makes me feel no better, does nothign but turn me off.  Fuck you. LIKE REALLY,  FUCK YOU  What did I ever do to deserve this?  Ok, well now I feel like a fucking psycho and I have two cigarettes left and I have no money left at all--like, completely fucking broke-- and I have no drive to do all the things that need to be done next week and worse yet, I'm disgusted at myself for whinning about this.  So I think the best thing would be for me to sign off now before I grow any more disillusioned with the last place I ever saw myself winding up at the age of 23.  Who woullda fucking guessed, eh?  HA!  God, this entry just made me feel even worse. Fuck you too, blog,
