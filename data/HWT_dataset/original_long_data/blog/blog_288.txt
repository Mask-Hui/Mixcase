The grand inquisitor asks: is it just me, or is there something not-quite-right about this image ? i mean, it's christ on the cross, except he's not exactly on the cross. It seems like kind of mish-mash of the crucifixion and the ascension. Can't say, exactly, but something about it set off my heterodoxometer. 'course, my 'doxometer has a bit of a hair-trigger - that's one of my major character flaws (the others being laziness, gluttony, intemperance and lack of self-control). Perhaps i should refer the matter to a member of the church militant with a higher pay-grade, like old oligarch.
