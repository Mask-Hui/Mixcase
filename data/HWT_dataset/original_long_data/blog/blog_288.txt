THE GRAND INQUISITOR ASKS: Is it just me, or is there something not-quite-right about  this image ? I mean, it's Christ on the Cross, except he's not exactly  on  the cross. It seems like kind of mish-mash of the Crucifixion and the Ascension. Can't say, exactly, but something about it set off my heterodoxometer. 'Course, my 'doxometer has a bit of a hair-trigger - that's one of my major character flaws (the others being laziness, gluttony, intemperance and lack of self-control). Perhaps I should refer the matter to a member of the Church Militant with a higher pay-grade, like  Old Oligarch.
