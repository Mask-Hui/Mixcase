So, a lot has been going on with me... So, debbie like fought with me over what china i was allowed to use. I mean come on do you pull out enough expensive china to feed a ientire frickin' black bapist choir! so, anyways she had dishes galore! saucers, tea pots, coffee cups, wine goblets, water glasses, 7 different types of forks and spoons, dinner plates, salad plate, dessert plate, soup bowl, side bowl... I was like omfg! and, then she yells at me for eating appetizers as the turkey was cooking! i was like i will eat trust me, grarrg! so, then to the hospital with my father. I saw a guy that was transporting a heart! it was like sooooo cool! so hmmm,... On my way back from richmond, virginia after my horrible thanksgiving we stopped at a rest stop, where one of my exes was! he walked up to me and started talking we exchanged numbers and when we got to virginia beach we called eachother and got together on friday and on saturday... (yes, we had hot, passionate monkey scarging). So, then michael's friend jessica broke up michael and anne's relationship because she wanted anne and micheal wanted me! *smiles* lol, so they broke up with the oppisite sex for same sex relationships. Tehe! so, michael is for me *does happy dance* then, michael and i talked on the phone until like 1am-ish. I feel really horrible about the bryan thingie... I was the one that should have said no, but i was sooooo caught up in the moment that i didn't and now it is a mere f---, nothing else i feel so bad and his age is another thing. 13-/14 is too young, and he was not very nice afterwards, so bryan you suck! jared you are soooo great! you know this! you are such a nice person and i hope you aren' to mad at me... Jared got my package in the mail, so that was good and makes me happy because it had some decent stuff in there, lol! i get one from him soon! well, the bell is ringing so i must part late! much love
