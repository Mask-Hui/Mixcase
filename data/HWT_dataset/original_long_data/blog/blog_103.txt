I'm back....after a week or so..haha..nothing special as usual busy with work.. Went to the moscow circus last night. The circus was terrific!! haven't been one before so i was really amazed by the performance. All the clowns, dogs playing soccer and the cowboys with the whip etc made me went wowowowowowo...ahahha my student cancelled her tuition today so i had a chance to sleep in on a sunday morning..its been ages since i last did that. Slept till 12 and woke up with a bad headache..haha..after my late breakfast i started to read..i've got to finish my books from the library first before i can start on my newly acquired book from the bookshop on saturday. I've got the book 'the present' by spencer johnson..the same guy who wrote 'who moved my cheese' i like that book very much. Not really because i learnt from it but rather i'm impressed with how the author made one understand the meaning of life with simple things like cheese and mice. It was for the first time i could really relate things in books to life :) i seldom read non-fiction books. I'm a sucker for novels...yea..give me all the novels and love stories..i can finish them all in a weekend like today. Everytime when i read, i always dream that i don't have to work and just stay at home and read non-stop how good will tat be!! anyway, i haven't been going to the gym recently because of the bad cold and all the work that's piling up. Feel damn guilty manz..i betta start going again. Meanwhile, i will just continue reading and reading and reading and reading. Oh yea if you are reading this, do you have any good books to recommend? i've got some borders gift card and i want to get a new book again!!!! hahahahaha
