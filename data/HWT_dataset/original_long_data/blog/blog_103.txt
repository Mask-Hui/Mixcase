Easter was ok. I felt out of sorts, a little. I left kind of early and i think that my mom felt bad. I should try to take her out to lunch sometime soon. I'm sure that all the people that checked on her before are starting to drop off. That's always the way. I saw an interesting movie last night. It was called 'morvern callar'. It had samantha morton in it. I like her. It was about this woman who's boyfriend commits suicide, then she 'steals' his unpublished novel and publishes it, making a ton of money. It's not really as evil as it sounds. That is why i liked the movie. There isn't any background on her character or the status of the relationship at all. She never tells anyone that the boyfriend has died. The first scene is great. It is her and what looks like a man asleep in bed, she is kind of snuggling up to him. Then the camera pulls back and you can see that they are on the kitchen floor, and that he is dead. You never know if she has just gone a little crazy, or if she was always that way. Was the boyfriend a bad guy? if he is dead, is she really stealing anything from anyone? i'm really curious about the novel now. I like things that let you make your own decisions. I don't want to be preached at. Morality is much to complicated.
