One of my horoscopes for today says:  It is up to you to take the initiative and make things happen. If you sit around waiting for others to make the first move, you won't get anywhere and the day will be wasted.  Libra is a Cardinal sign and that means you have leadership qualities, so what are you waiting for? Others will follow you if you show them the way.   Another says: You're the consummate host, the perfect date, the most generous friend and the best worker.  But when it comes to love, providing everything is the worst thing you could provide. Let others show you what they've got.    Both seem rather fitting for today! SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT, DAMNIT! That's what I say. Can't we be greedy once in a while?
