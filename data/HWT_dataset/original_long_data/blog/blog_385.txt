Shoutouts to rachel griffiths (who had a baby), tom cruise (who got a haircut), the cast of the oc (who are #1 on the tv list of breakout stars of 2003) and keira knightsley (who is number one in movies) c.j.: good morning, mrs. Landingham. Where are we in the saga of toby and the president? mrs. Landingham: they seem to be having a disagreement. C.j.: a disagreement or a fight? mrs. Landingham: well, it certainly has the potential... Bartlet [os] [shouts]: oh, for godâ€™s sakes toby! mrs. Landingham: there we go. Oooh, chickfight on the blog. Ten bucks on sophia. Any takers? the following is the expressed opinion of michael christie, and does not reflect the views of marten dollenger or the staff of compendium of stupidity i think that it would make sense if sophia gave a reason why she hated ryan hagan. That would explain why. Also i find it somewhat shocking that marten actually edited a post. I'd also just like to congratulate compendium of stupidity on three months online. Also i'll be posting a piece on weddings, currently titled 'untitled michael christie blog post'. It's so delightfully meta, don't you think? the obligatory television without pity quote. These will appear until y'all visit. Pamie: that damn suchin is finishing up. Stee: now, suchin...she won a contest, right? she's not actually a vj. Please tell me that. Pamie: she does that thing to me that happens to kramer when he hears mary hart's voice. Stee: i'm gonna interview you in the style of the mtv video music awards opening. Pamie: okay. And i'll do it like a guy who's there. Stee: 'okay, okay! so pam! i mean, i mean...! hey, there's...! i'm standing...! hey! i...there's....! thanks, kurt! i'm standing here on the red carpet with...pam--' pamie: 'right, right, true, true!' stee: 'so, pam! this is absolutely amazing here tonight, isn't it?' pamie: 'oh, you know, it's like i'm saying, i've been, i mean, you know. I'm just here. I'm just sayin'. You know, everything's been a really good year and we're all just really happy about everything--' stee: '--is--?' pamie: '--and how everything has worked out.' stee: 'now, isn't our red carpet really red?' pamie: 'oh, you know, it's like i'm saying, it's like, yeah, i mean, it's like, crazy, man, it's like, amazing.' stee: 'now, i understand that you, uh, don't like kurt loder. Is that true?' pamie: 'oh, you know, it's like i'm saying. Everybody has like, things going on and stuff and it's like, you kinda, you know, you work through it. You know, and everything. But my new album, chicken and red meat, drops october7th, and that is what it's all about. Chicken! chicken! october seventh!' stee: 'all right...' pamie: 'woooooo!' stee: 'how many, how many hours a day do you watch mtv?' pamie: 'what? i'm sorry, i was talkin' to my boy! that's my boy right there! t-bok! and t-bok, come over here, t-bok! woooo!' stee: 'i forget...' pamie: 'wooooo!' stee: 'i forget who i'm...who you're talking to.' pamie: 'oh, you know, it's like i'm saying.' stee: 'hey, fat guy! uh...sway! umm....' pamie: 'wooo! october 7th!' stee: 'suchin! someone help me!' pamie: 'october 7th! october 7th!' stee: man. Pamie: and now...the 2003 mtv video music awards! in the hizzy! -pamie and stee on the mtv video music awards. The hilarious title of the recap is 'yo yo! our recap drops on september 8th! hollah!' seriously there is something for all of y'all. Children of dune recaps for the comstocks. Regina's alias recaps for marten. I don't know what thomas, sophia, erin or lara watch, so i guess there are only things for the comstocks and marten. Never mind.
