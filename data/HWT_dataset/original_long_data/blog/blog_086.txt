Bored bored bored i must say, i was terribly disappointed in the sketch comedy proferred to me this afternoon by comedy central. It was very weak. Saturday night live failed to stimulate. And kids in the hall only made me laugh out loud once. Now...that's a sad episode of kids. I suppose this wouldn't have been so disappointing if it hadn't been the only thing i'd done all day. But it is and it was. Sigh. My mom brought home price club cookies, and now i'm just going to spend the rest of the evening in this cookie-induced stupor that i am powerless to prevent. Damn cookies. Ah well.
