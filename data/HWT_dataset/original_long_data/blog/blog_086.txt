Man, i am in trouble again. The t-shirt stealing thing has only recently concluded and i appear once again on the wrong side of law. Mr koh is already really pissed with me, and now some one told him that i threatened aaron about some history test thingy!!! that’s soo non-existent. I hope i can resolve this one quickly without getting into any further trouble. If u happen to be the one who told mr koh or maybe you told someone who could have told mr koh, please contact me cause you have made a mistake. Oh yah, if anyone knows who told mr chow about my selling food in class thing please contact me asap. I really wish ri boys had more integrity than this, if a class mate cannot put his trust in you… who can?
