It's been a pretty nothing-doing day.  I played Counterstrike/was on the phone with Alex most of the day, I lost pathetically and was consequently made fun of. But who cares, the game is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy too real, and  games  that focus on reality aren't even worth playing. Call me a n00b if you must, since I am, but I just like games that take the emphasis off of 'get shot=dead' and more on 'get shot a few times=use god powerup=RESURRECTION=get shot a few more times=run like hell using speed powerup=get hit by opponent's gun powerup=dead'. Yeah, y'all get the idea.  I listened to POOR BASTARD all the way through,  Died  is a little mest in the middle, I probably won't reburn it though, it took forever to get all those songs together, and a little blip in the midst of the song isn't gonna change anything major.  Ugh, my earring ear is bleeding and dripping all over the place, heh. I felt a few drops on my shoulder just now and I was like, 'Agh, ceiling's leaking freon or something' and then noticed the remarkable scarlet hue.  And Happy Chinese New Year all, I hope you're all enjoying the year of Yog-Soggoth......I mean, the Goat.  Because  I  am tired for some reason, caffeine overload.  Happyhappyjoyjoy.
