It's been a pretty nothing-doing day. I played counterstrike/was on the phone with alex most of the day, i lost pathetically and was consequently made fun of. But who cares, the game is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy too real, and games that focus on reality aren't even worth playing. Call me a n00b if you must, since i am, but i just like games that take the emphasis off of 'get shot=dead' and more on 'get shot a few times=use god powerup=resurrection=get shot a few more times=run like hell using speed powerup=get hit by opponent's gun powerup=dead'. Yeah, y'all get the idea. I listened to poor bastard all the way through, died is a little mest in the middle, i probably won't reburn it though, it took forever to get all those songs together, and a little blip in the midst of the song isn't gonna change anything major. Ugh, my earring ear is bleeding and dripping all over the place, heh. I felt a few drops on my shoulder just now and i was like, 'agh, ceiling's leaking freon or something' and then noticed the remarkable scarlet hue. And happy chinese new year all, i hope you're all enjoying the year of yog-soggoth......i mean, the goat. Because i am tired for some reason, caffeine overload. Happyhappyjoyjoy.
