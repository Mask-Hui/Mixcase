Hey, it looks like the weather forecasters called it right, i'd say right now we have a good 8 inches and it's still pouring down. It's that wet heavy type of snow, all the tree limbs are weighted down low to the ground..this worries us because 1 year 98 i think it came a big wet heavy snow and trees and power lines went down, this place was a mess! power was off 5 days and thats a tuff scenario considering my disability, but luckily we did have wood heat and that kept us warm anyways, but now we dont have that, so if the power goes off we'll get cold in here...and thats not a good thing!!!! outside my window here the birds are feeding heavy on the four super feeders i have hung in our front yard, lots of colors out there blending with all the white snow, the red cardinals are my favorite, i think all these thieving squirrels are getting most of the seed, but hey..they gotta eat too. My sister sherry is sick with a fever, she thinks she may have the flu..i hope n pray not, it's been a pretty bad season for the flu around here, but had tappered off some we 'thought'..well there's not as many missing in church now as there was back in dec. & jan...i hope she will get well soon. Over & out til next time!
