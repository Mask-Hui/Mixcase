Hello world and welcome to my BLOG (what a name huh?). I consider this a journal of sorts and I have attempted to do this many many times in my life and either ended up losing interest due to a lack of time or just plain a lack of time.  In these pages I will without hesitation post my day to day activities as well give you a glimpse into my past. Although only 33 years old I fell I have done more in my life than some will do in a life time, albeit not all what one would consider the 'norm'  Well enough blabbering lets get on with it. I will describe myself in my profile for the blog.  ****
