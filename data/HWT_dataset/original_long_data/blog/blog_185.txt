Screw that last post! i'm not one to give up or wallow in self-pity, right? besides, i think it kinda made me sound waayy emotional or something *hehe* i'm having fun.. Nothing wrong with that, true? i'm just gonna with the flow and enjoy the ride while it lasts. I don't know where the stop is, or what it's gonna be like.. I'm not about to worry too much about it. I'm here for the fun times and the excitement of curiousity. Woohooo! had dinner at hartamas with fahmy, boboy, shak and ajim. Anas got off work at 9pm last night, but joined us later when we hit planet hollywood after dinner. We hung out there for a bit, a few drinks and then made a move. I think we left at midnight or a little after that. Nothing much, just hanging out talking and observing the crowd. As for my exam.. It was at 10.20am, so i was there super early. Oh, and dumb me didn't notice that they did paste the exam schedule outside the door. Oops. Since i had a couple of hours to kill, i headed to shak's place to study. The paper turned out alright, i guess. With that out of the way, i am free of study worries until may. Except for one thing, i gotta get an application in for my degree course. I don't think the forms are out yet, though. I'm feeling pain in the financial department, so i'm gonna start serving the evil empire of business trends again. Right now, i gotta go shower and hit the bank *ouchy ouch* and pay off my debts. A couple bucks here and there and *walla!* the total is about a hundred bucks. Funny shit. *logs off*
