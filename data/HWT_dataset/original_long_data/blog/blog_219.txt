I think we all agreed, at least those who where there monday and blogged on here, that wednesday the 11th would work. Do you want me to go to kroger and get the tickets? i need to know exactly how many people to get tickets for. Kerri, is your mom going to be able to make it? another thing we need to think about is how we are going to get there. It would save us on parking if we went together, but we need to figure out a time, place to meet, and who can drive. If you have any ideas on any of this please let me know. I need to get the tickets before the start of the fair to get them at the reduced price. If you could blog, email, or call me and let me know that would be great. Fair food here we come!
