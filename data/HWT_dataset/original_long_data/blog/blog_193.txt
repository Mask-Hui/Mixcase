I think that Monpoly has run it's course in my life and I vow to never lay my hands on that damn iron (not a hot one but the piece in the game) again. Tonight Andy beat me by a few small dollars and won the farquin game, or maybe I let him win on account of him leaving in a few short hours and me wanting him to feel good on his last night here. Well how ever the story goes it can't compare to this Texas sized headache I have at the moment, I've taken some aleve and I must say that they are doing the trick, all I need now is some well deserved R&R  Your telephone's the one that helped me wrap the cord around your neck...
