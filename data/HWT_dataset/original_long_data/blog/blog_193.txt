I think that monpoly has run it's course in my life and i vow to never lay my hands on that damn iron (not a hot one but the piece in the game) again. Tonight andy beat me by a few small dollars and won the farquin game, or maybe i let him win on account of him leaving in a few short hours and me wanting him to feel good on his last night here. Well how ever the story goes it can't compare to this texas sized headache i have at the moment, i've taken some aleve and i must say that they are doing the trick, all i need now is some well deserved r&r your telephone's the one that helped me wrap the cord around your neck...
