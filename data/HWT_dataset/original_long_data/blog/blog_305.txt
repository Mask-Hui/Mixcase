Holla so i saw troy tonight with my family...i was not impressed. I'm too tired to go way into specifics, but i do think it had potential. However, i think too much energy was spent on the set (which was magnificent) and not enough on creating a solidifying tone, theme, etc. It retold the story, but it was not particularly gripping, and i don't feel like i gained anything from watching it. The character development was rather weak. Additionally, i thought the score was poor, and was basically a knock-off of the gladiator. The gladiator used the background music of a moaning woman and it worked b/c it backed up and complemented a genuinely gripping narrative. Troy just tried to copy its predecessor, but it lacked in substance, thereby making the score nothing less than corny. I didn't find brad pitt sexy either. Except in the beginning when he first converses with the captive woman (forgot the name) and he is naked and covered in dirt in blood. That was hot. Other than that, i thought hector was sexier. Whatever...i'm waiting to see kill bill vol. 2. Anyone wanna go?
