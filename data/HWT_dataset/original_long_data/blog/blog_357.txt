I have to admit my small brain dried out when i read this particular story. I did not get it at first, i had to review it a couple of times more for me to digest it. I was torn on whether i would take the story at face value and really think that her lover was transforming and de - evolutionizing literally, or consider his morphing as something symbolical. Prima face (tama ba spelling?), the story is entertaining enough. You could just imagine the look on the girl's face everytime his boyfriend turns into a primate or an amphibian. But still i searched for deeper meaning or interpretation. I had to, i did not know why but i had to. And so with a little help from a friend i came to believe that the man was a schizophrenic, or was undergoing mental decay... Some sort of degeneration. Generally i liked the story, it allowed us to have a peek inside the mind of a girl struggling and dealing with an (unusual) imperfect and challenging relationship.the author's use of animals and darwin's principle as symbols was for me, smart. It was different and fresh, well at least for me. The story was also successful in not trying to be too mushy. But as all love story goes/are, it had those 'aaaawwwww...' moments. Like the part where the boyfriend, on his last few days as a human being said something about having too much thought, not enough heart. The only thing that bothered me was the lack of emotion from the girl. She seemed not to care, she seemed too comfortable with the situation and the changes... Calleja, sam 0178595 cw 111
