Whatever it is they put into freeze pops to make them those colours, there should be some sort of warning: may make your life a bit bizarre. And whilst giggling is good, one wonders if we would have found ourselves up that fire escape drinking beer in the fierce wind had we not been eating them earlier. Finding ourselves in a doorway to a bar sadly closed for business, we stopped to examine an office-supplies catalogue that had arrived in the post. Lucky we did. Who could possibly have guessed that within these pages were the special offers of a lifetime? not i, for certain. I list but a few: buy 36 permanent marker pens, get a stunt kite. Buy 30 lever arch files, get a barbecue. Buy 600 plastic wallets, get a crate of diet coke. Buy 3 boxes of pilot hi-techpont pens, get an inflatable basketball set. Buy 4 boxes of manila envelopes, get a gazebo. A gazebo? the message here is clear: forget what you think you know, the world is far weirder than you thought. Especially in the realm of office supplies. N.
