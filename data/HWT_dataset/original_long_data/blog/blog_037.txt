That does explain it indeed. I haven't watched any of it yet. In fact i don't tend to watch particular channels, its the programs i'm after. Thinking about it now the channel i watch a lot is e4 with such great programs as er, friends, smallville and many many more. Other than that i don't really have many other programs i watch other than the royal. How fun. I am writing this at school by the way and tom has a squeaky voice. Lololololol. That was funny eating lunch o 20 minutes ago as darren and jackie kept giving each other wedgies. Sooooooooooooo amusing.
