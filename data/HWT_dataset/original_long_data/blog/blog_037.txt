That does explain it indeed. I haven't watched any of it yet. In fact I don't tend to watch particular channels, its the programs I'm after. Thinking about it now the channel I watch a lot is E4 with such great programs as ER, Friends, Smallville and many many more. Other than that I don't really have many other programs I watch other than The Royal. How fun. I am writing this at school by the way and Tom has a squeaky voice. LOLOLOLOLOL. That was funny eating lunch o 20 minutes ago as Darren and Jackie kept giving each other wedgies. Sooooooooooooo amusing.
