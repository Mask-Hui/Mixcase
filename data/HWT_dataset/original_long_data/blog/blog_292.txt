It's almost one but i had to type my review of 'american splendor.' it is brilliant. V. Witty and funny but not the dumb type of humor (i.e. Adam sandler). And the film is not shot in a conventional way. But it goes behind the camera, incorporates comic strip illustrations. I am so happy to have fin-nally seen a movie worth watching. I thought 'swimming pool' would do it for me... But no. Not really. I would watch 'american splendor' again. Especially since the guy next to me was one of those people who would say, 'omigosh, i can't believe he did that!' or repeat the line just said while chuckling. Okay. This is not your living room. Hello? so annoying. Anyway, this is a film i recommend!
