Late last night, it was brought to my attention by Adam that Michelle was rushed to the emergency room. What happened was that she was working somewhere when she accidentally stepped on a Mud Wasp nest. She was stung 20 times on her side, did I mention Michelle is deathly allergic to bee stings? Well, she is.  They found her passed out on the ground. She was then taken to the hospital, and that is when they called me. I was thinking about heading down there on an airplane, but they said she would be fine.  Anyway, she is going to be in the hospital for a couple of days and she will not be able to post at all. I am not sure if Abby has heard about this yet, but I am not going to tell her. Jackie already knows though and she will be posting soon too.
