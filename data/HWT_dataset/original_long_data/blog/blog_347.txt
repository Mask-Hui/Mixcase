I got my diploma today! it's at home in florida so i haven't seen it but it's there. I'm mostly excited about the one for my wallet. That's cool. I'm slightly peeved because i graduated cum laude though. To graduate magna cum laude i had to have a gpa of 3.6 or better, which i did. But they only count my gpa at urllink campbell for honors, so my gpa from urllink bcf doesn't count. Which sucks because my gpa at campbell was like a 3.588. All i needed was one better grade in one class. The thing that's so irritating is that i blew off spanish last fall and got a c in there because i didn't care. If i would have at least gotten a b i would have magna. The reason this is important is because tammi graduated magna. Finally my lack of studying catches up with me. I also got a comforter yesterday. I got it at target. Blue and white stripes for a good price. Just what i wanted. Butta, the duvet might have to wait for marriage.
