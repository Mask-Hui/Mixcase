i got my diploma today! it's at home in florida so i haven't seen it but it's there. i'm mostly excited about the one for my wallet. that's cool. i'm slightly peeved because i graduated cum laude though. to graduate magna cum laude i had to have a gpa of 3.6 or better, which i did. but they only count my gpa at  urlLink campbell for honors, so my gpa from  urlLink bcf  doesn't count. which sucks because my gpa at campbell was like a 3.588. all i needed was one better grade in one class. the thing that's so irritating is that i blew off spanish last fall and got a c in there because i didn't care. if i would have at least gotten a b i would have magna. the reason this is important is because tammi graduated magna. finally my lack of studying catches up with me.       i also got a comforter yesterday. i got it at target. blue and white stripes for a good price. just what i wanted. butta, the duvet might have to wait for marriage.
