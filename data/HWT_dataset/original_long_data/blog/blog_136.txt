I heard gore's speech yesterday, very, um, how should we say eloquent. He's about as motivating as a tree stump. A dead tree stump. Seriously, i love howard dean, the dems should have run him. 'and then we're going back to washington dc to take back the white house- yaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!'. Howard dean is great. Kerry is lucky to have him drumming up support for his campaign. In other news kerry backed out of his plan to not accept the nomination(which would not allow him to raise anymore money). He had the gaul to blame bush, 'because bush didn't limit his take to 19 million and take matching funds, it forced kerry to consider not taking the nomination' to paraphrase. What an ass.
