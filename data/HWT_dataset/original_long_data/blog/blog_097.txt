29. Owning Mahowny  Crazy gambling movie.  Based on a true story, racks up a $10 million dollar debt.  Insane!   30. Shallow Hal  Meh, I liked how Gwyneth Paltrow learned to waddle like a fat lady.   31. Ringu  Omg, fucking scary.   32. The Ring  Total rip off of The Ringu.  The credits that give credit to the book and the original movie is like 2 minutes later.  Fucking the scenes were stolen shot for shot and the whole horse thing, and change of story, complete gayness, the original movie was better, and scarier.   33. Spiderman-2  Oh the elevator scene. :D   34. The Last Casino  I love this movie, I love it. It's Canadian too.  Oh my, it's up there on my list now.   35. Bollywood/Hollywood  Meh, interesting movie, although it seemed kinda short :p   I've been sick this entire week, trying to do stuff, feeling woozy and like death most of the time.  I dunno, and today, I though it would be best if I just laid on my couch for a long time.  Oh sweet sweet couch.
