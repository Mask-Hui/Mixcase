29. Owning mahowny crazy gambling movie. Based on a true story, racks up a $10 million dollar debt. Insane! 30. Shallow hal meh, i liked how gwyneth paltrow learned to waddle like a fat lady. 31. Ringu omg, fucking scary. 32. The ring total rip off of the ringu. The credits that give credit to the book and the original movie is like 2 minutes later. Fucking the scenes were stolen shot for shot and the whole horse thing, and change of story, complete gayness, the original movie was better, and scarier. 33. Spiderman-2 oh the elevator scene. :d 34. The last casino i love this movie, i love it. It's canadian too. Oh my, it's up there on my list now. 35. Bollywood/hollywood meh, interesting movie, although it seemed kinda short :p i've been sick this entire week, trying to do stuff, feeling woozy and like death most of the time. I dunno, and today, i though it would be best if i just laid on my couch for a long time. Oh sweet sweet couch.
