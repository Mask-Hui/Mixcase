By shafika mattar, associated press writer amman, jordan - the kidnappers of four jordanians in iraq (news - web sites) have promised to release them saturday because their relatives and fellow staged an anti-american demonstration as demanded of them, the brother of a hostage said late friday. The kidnapping became known tuesday when dubai television broadcast a video tape showing four men holding their identification cards. A man off-camera said 'all muslim and arab nations, especially those neighboring iraq' should not cooperate with the americans. Mohammed abu jaafar, whose brother ahmad is being held, told the associated press said he received a call from one of the purported kidnappers who said they were pleased by the television pictures of the protest in irbid in northern jordan. 'we decided to release them on saturday morning,' abu jaafar quoted the kidnapper as saying. The kidnapper said the hostages would be handed over at a jordanian field hospital in iraq or 'we will escort them to the border,' he said. Jordanian foreign ministry spokesman ali al ayed said the government has instructed its embassy in baghdad to investigate the kidnapping by a group calling itself 'mujahedeen of iraq, the group of death.' insurgents have taken more than 70 foreigners hostage in iraq in recent months in an effort to force their countries to withdraw troops and to hamper reconstruction work. -- i'll believe it when they are free.
