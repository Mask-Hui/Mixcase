For those of you who haven't heard yet I've been offically made redundant since the end of Feb and I'm now a professional bum at home.    One and a half weeks of bumming so far and it's not as bad as I thought it would be since there seems to be a lot of things for me to catch up on like meeting up with old friends, cleaning up my workspace so that the fire department doesn't classify it as a fire hazard and upgrading my trusty old PC.  Well, if anyone is free these days, you know who you can call for lunch :D
