Woke up at 11:30 am. Now in my lab, about to check out another lab since they're setting up some cool equipment. I am cool. I work in a lab. I am, as strong bad says, 'crazy-go-nuts.' i am cool. **** i was reading some random blogs of acquaintances (not friends) that i had in college, and it is striking to see further confirmation on why i never continued efforts to reach out to them. We are all imperfect, but sometimes there are those you can tell really don't seem to be worth the time and energy; they end up exhibiting their ultimately self-centered natures like we all do, but they never make an effort to admit that it's wrong and to fight those tendencies. They blame the world for not serving them, they complain. We all do it, but some don't find it to be something wrong. Anyhow, i'm glad that i still have had the blessing to know friends that are ardent about fighting those sinful tendencies. God uses these friends to motivated me to join the fight against selfishness. On a totally different subject, it is also striking to see how unstable our hearts can be. At least, my heart is quite unpredictable. I'm still trying to make it listen, to make it forgive, to make it love in the face of rejection, failure, and inconsideration. Thank goodness that the gospel is objective, otherwise i would have done so many more stupid and un-edifying things. Back to life.
