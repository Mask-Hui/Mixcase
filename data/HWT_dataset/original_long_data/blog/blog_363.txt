'One can only feel joy if he is first in depression.'-----Haniff-----  I am so damn bloody happy.I got an A1 for my 'o'level mother tounge. Phew.... I know why i'm so short. all the weight of exams and other stuff was on my shoulders.... now one huge load has been lifted.... i'm so glad... Then i see other people's reactions. Pains the hell out of me. I seriously din expect some others like Sharifah Mitzi or Yuniza to get anythin less then A2.... haiz feels so damn unfair.... It's almost like i cheated them or smth i dunno.... juz feels so sad.... A friend asked me today, who do i like? wad do i say? i wanna tell him i like her.... but the name juz wouldn't come out of my mouth.... maybe i oughta tell him.... he is gd friends with her.... (to the guy, is this a big enuff hint??) juz hope once he know he'll keep quiet abt it.... When he guessed the person i never denied... i couldn't... I'm one of the biggest liar around and i couldn't lie abt that.... too bad, she the only one hu beleives me, at least i think so....  I'm outta her league and i have no i dea how to get in... i make her laugh once in a while at least tt helps... She always talk abt other guys around me so that's a bit troubling.... Funny thing is, i support her if the guy she likes is nice or good.... guess i like her so much i care abt her happiness more than my own....  I'm gonna end my entry here today.... to moany to moan more...lol.... anyway peace out to the world.... good luck with the exams and wish me luck..... in my exams and my life...i'll need it...
