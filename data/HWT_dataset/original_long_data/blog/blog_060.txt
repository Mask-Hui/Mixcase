So, here i am: seth kaltwasser, documenting the first day of summer vacation. Junior year is over. It's been a long journey, but as of today, i have only one year of school left. Senior year. And that blows my mind. Junior year certainly was a good one. Very possibly the best ever. It seems like just yesterday the year started and i was blown away to realize that i was officially an 'upperclassmen'. As an 'upperclassmen', i finally got a chance to perform leading roles in the school's two theatre productions (the musical 'anything goes' and the play 'it runs in the family'). Also, the katie mccormack and i made all-state in speech with our skit, 'i'm herbert'. Finally, show choir brought the greatest and least expected reward of all: the incredible heidi uridil, a sophomore. Seven weeks and five days ago i ended my extended age as a single guy (which lasted 5 years). The almost two months that followed were quite possibly the best of my life. That brings us to this week. My last week with this year's seniors. We'll see each other again, yes. But the memories we made together this last year will never be equaled. So, here i am, on the first day of summer. In a couple of minutes i will leave to go pick up heidi so that we can begin our weekend of attending graduation parties. Tomorrow is commencement where we officially close the book on last year. What's on the horizon for this summer? hopefully, i'll be getting a job. I have one more week of heidi before letting her go spend three weeks at camp. Add that to the three weeks i'll be spending on a family vacation and you have a consecutive six weeks that we'll be communicating only by phone. It will be hard, but i have every intention of making this week last as long as possible. Anyways, i have to be going. Don't want to keep heidi waiting. Peace out.
