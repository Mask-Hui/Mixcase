Very stoked, i have been offered a gmail account from blogger, very cool. Now i just have to find a computer which i can access and open up the account on as work blocks the gmail site to stop me wasting all my time there i guess. How inconvenient. No real time to comment much today as i have been busy trying to get a few photos off my ipod for the weekend. Accomplished about 5 or 6 photos off, but now i've got to head to the gym for the pilates session. Adios. 'i used to think that the brain was the most wonderful organ in my body.
