Joshua went back to school yesterday. It doesn't seem like two minutes since i took him for a couple of hours during the last term before he started and now he's in year 2. He seems to have grown loads in the summer, even so i bet he's still one of the smallest in his class. We got the usual report from him about what he'd done during the day - 'work and pe'. He was excited about bringing home some spelling to learn as homework as well as the usual reading book. I can't imagine he's going to keep the excitement for homework for too long.
