Stumbled upon flight of the phoenix , by elleston trevor, at the local library. It was on the staff recommendation shelf. Published in 1964, it tells the story of a small group of men whose plane crashes into the libyan desert. One of them figures out how to cobble together a plane or sorts out of the wreckage. During the construction of the plane there are many battles with hunger, thirst, and sanity. It's the kind of book that would be good to read in the middle of a long winter - - you really get hot and thirsty reading it. The book was made into a movie in 1965. Must try to find it - starred jimmy stewart, richard attenborough, enerest borgnine, george kennedy and others. A new version of the movie is in production, scheduled for 2004 release.
