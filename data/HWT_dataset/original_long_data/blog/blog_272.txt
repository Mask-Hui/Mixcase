The dog pictured above is champion coedwig's carbon blue . I have high hopes that he will be the father of futuredog. A year and a half ago, when i decided i might want a cardigan welsh corgi, i also decided to paint a 'blue dog' type painting of grendel (r ed dog ). I did a google image search to find a template to work off of and ran across urllink starbuck . He was sitting outside the blue dog studio in carmel, ca, handsome as you please. I was in love. He was the most beautiful dog i'd ever seen, and i had to have a blue dog of my own. When i started looking for breeders i found mention of starbuck on the urllink coedwig website, and learned that carbon was his dad. Since then i've hoped to end up with a carbon kid, but didn't have much ambition about it actually happening. ( as if it couldn't be a conscious decision! ) so i got on a couple of lists. And then i waited. And waited. And waited. A year passed, and i said to myself, 'wow, this waiting around really sucks. I want my damn dog.' people wait for puppies all the time, but even after a harrowing twelve months there was no end in sight. So i decided to get proactive. I contacted kathleen mallery of urllink castell pembroke welsh corgis , who also has a couple of cardigans and whom i'd met at the boise dog show the year before, and told her i wanted to get the show on the road, so to speak. She recommended a few people in the northwest (my previous options were both over a thousand miles away), and i found that carolyn cannon of urllink c-myste had a bitch, phoebe, that was recently pregnant. Her friend, louise sargent of urllink wolfrun , was also expecting a litter from the same stud dog with her girl brandy. And who do you think that dog-daddy was? things seem to be coming up roses for futuredog. His dad may be one of the top cardigans in the country. Another breeder in oregon, who i met at the coeur d'alene show in july, recently contacted me to offer me a blue girl from her current litter, who is five weeks old. If i were so inclined, i could have futuredog five weeks from now. Tempting as that is, i think i'd regret not waiting for my dream dog. Fate has smiled on me, and it might really piss it off if i turned down its generous offer. Two more months shouldn't be unendurable. Right?
