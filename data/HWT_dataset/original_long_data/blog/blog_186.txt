All of a sudden, for the past two days, I have been overcome with terrible bouts of exhaustion. Bone dead exhaustion. Last evening, I went home, and just slept off, and only got up when my mother called me around eight thirty. And when I woke up, it was all dark, and I hadn't switched the lights on, so I could not figure out what time or date it was, for a few seconds, it was just my mother's voice in the darkness and me grappling with reality. Wonder why I'm feeling so drained...  Nice weather this morning. It was drizzling when I came. Although in Calcutta I hear it's been raining for the past three days. God, how I miss the coastal rains. That's why I've chosen to go home in July - when the monsoons will be on full swing. I need to see rain, I miss it too much.   Ranjith called last night. He is in Thrissur for 10 days. So we were like - Woh, we're in the same COUNTRY now at least! Again I put myself up for adoption, and again he said he would need time to think about it :-)   Finally, I think I need a new job. Everyone around is getting a new job. SS landed a stint with Macromedia in Bangalore. AK got Ernst & Young. And me? I can't just sit around and wait to be a fossil in NIIT.  Sometimes I look at the people here and see the ones who've stuck around this place for ten-eleven years. I just can't see myself devoting so much of my life to just ONE place. Besides, I need more money. By next year I should have bought my own car and/or got myself a month's holiday and go see UK again. I'm stagnating here :-(  My ideal job would of course be sitting in a beach-house type set-up and typing short stories while I sip ginger ale and thoughtfully light up a mauve cigarette, but until that happens, I could do with a corporate job that pays me more and gives me a laptop :-)
