All of a sudden, for the past two days, i have been overcome with terrible bouts of exhaustion. Bone dead exhaustion. Last evening, i went home, and just slept off, and only got up when my mother called me around eight thirty. And when i woke up, it was all dark, and i hadn't switched the lights on, so i could not figure out what time or date it was, for a few seconds, it was just my mother's voice in the darkness and me grappling with reality. Wonder why i'm feeling so drained... Nice weather this morning. It was drizzling when i came. Although in calcutta i hear it's been raining for the past three days. God, how i miss the coastal rains. That's why i've chosen to go home in july - when the monsoons will be on full swing. I need to see rain, i miss it too much. Ranjith called last night. He is in thrissur for 10 days. So we were like - woh, we're in the same country now at least! again i put myself up for adoption, and again he said he would need time to think about it :-) finally, i think i need a new job. Everyone around is getting a new job. Ss landed a stint with macromedia in bangalore. Ak got ernst & young. And me? i can't just sit around and wait to be a fossil in niit. Sometimes i look at the people here and see the ones who've stuck around this place for ten-eleven years. I just can't see myself devoting so much of my life to just one place. Besides, i need more money. By next year i should have bought my own car and/or got myself a month's holiday and go see uk again. I'm stagnating here :-( my ideal job would of course be sitting in a beach-house type set-up and typing short stories while i sip ginger ale and thoughtfully light up a mauve cigarette, but until that happens, i could do with a corporate job that pays me more and gives me a laptop :-)
