so just two days till my sister comes home for good. i cant tell you how happy i am, i miss her soo much during the time she is away at school. shes someone who i can talk to about everything...not like mom who i can talk to about a lot...but ya know...cant tell her it all...but i can talk about everything and  anyone ..without having to worry about it getting out or anything. its also nice just to have her around. like late at night when she comes home and says goodnight or just someone to paint my nails or anything...the little things like that. im realllllly stoked i cant even begin to say so. when shes away we seldom get to talk like we do at home. and plus dan;s coming home with her. which is cool because mom makes good food :) we usually go out a lot more..and i like him. hes good for her. and hes a great partner for hi lo ;) anyway im just glad that she'll be around for like the next 3 monthes. it will be more fun. its hard to think that she'll never be back for good again. so im trying not to. but hey im not thinking about the long run...just the short for right now..
