I feel your pain, Roseo.  My mom's yelling at me for not doing my summer reading but I SWEAR I'll do some tomorrow...unless I decide not to.  ;)  Anyway, you'll only see Mohicans if you come over here or if I go over there, because I'm not letting that DVD out of my SIGHT!  I love it!  It's great.  I bought the soundtrack.  I'm completely smitten, but I won't elaborate unless you want to go on my LiveJournal.  Aaaaaanyway, feeling better tonight.  Last night was hell.  I just tend to be really down after I see my dad.  It's almost like coming off a caffeine high or something...well, talk to you guys later.  ~Z
