I feel your pain, roseo. My mom's yelling at me for not doing my summer reading but i swear i'll do some tomorrow...unless i decide not to. ;) anyway, you'll only see mohicans if you come over here or if i go over there, because i'm not letting that dvd out of my sight! i love it! it's great. I bought the soundtrack. I'm completely smitten, but i won't elaborate unless you want to go on my livejournal. Aaaaaanyway, feeling better tonight. Last night was hell. I just tend to be really down after i see my dad. It's almost like coming off a caffeine high or something...well, talk to you guys later. ~z
