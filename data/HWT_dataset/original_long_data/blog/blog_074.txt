Prom is tomorrow.... I hope it is goona be fun.. that is all I ask.  Rob gets here May 14th..... yeah 3 weeks today.... Oh God I think I am giving myself an ulcer thinking about it. But I am so excited to see him, scared to yes, but tres excited.   Leafs played last night.... but becuase Calgary was playing at the same time and I am out on the West Coast.... I had to watch the Calgary game, not the Leaf game.... which is alright I guess.. considering my Leafs lost.. and that makes me sad. But Philly is a good team.. so... I still have Bragging rights.. They made it farther then the Damn Canucks!  Today is a crazy day... I have so much to do.... School till 1:40.... Tanning at 2..... Make-up Conseltation at 2:30..... Pick up my dress around 3:30.... then go home and get ready for work to be there for 5:30 - 9:30.... come home... and NOT talk to Rob cause he will be at work... (11-7am his time).... so I won't be talking to him till Saturday evening before I leave to go to Prom.... yeah I think I am getting excited now.. Plus Brian is excited.. which helps... A LOT!   So yeah.. this post was pretty much about nonesense.. but I have to take my mind of things... otherwise I will be thinking to much.. and that right now is not something I want to be doing.  I really miss Jazz.... Rob and I were talking about her.. and all the fun times her and I have had throught the years.. and I miss that...  (sticks in bum.... farting boys on rocks.... the WelFair... where I was a total bitch.... all our inside jokes and sayings... NOT ONE FUNNY, BUT TWO FUNNY... tequilla.. puking in her bathroom... Poor Man's pudding...) I can't wait to go home and just hang out with her again.... (YEAH JAZZ... WE IS GOING TO THE BAR.... SO GET YOUR PARTY SHOES OUT OF THE CLOSET AND DUST THEM OFF!)  Ok... well I am not done enough work for today.. so I guess I will do some now....   ** Hey Martha.... you are so cool..... when I get back.. we will go and do 'girl stuff' hahaha and talk about 'girl things'** (yeah I said that cause Rob INSTANTLY wonders what the hell I mean.. hahahahaha!)   Maybe Rob can kiddnapp Kaylee and bring her here too... see I should just go... I am still thinking!  ~Loves~  P.S.  This song rocks!    Just Another Day in Paradise    The kids screaming, phone ringing  Dog barking at the mailman bringing  That stack of bills - overdue  Good morning baby, how are you?  Got a half hour, quick shower  Take a drink of milk but the milk's gone sour  My funny face makes you laugh  Twist the top on and I put it back  There goes the washing machine  Baby, don't kick it.  I promise I'll fix it  Long about a million other things   Well, it's ok. It's so nice  It's just another day in paradise  Well, there's no place that  I'd rather be  Well, it's two hearts  And one dream  I wouldn't trade it for anything  And I ask the lord every night  For just another day in paradise   Friday, you're late  Guess we'll never make our dinner date  At the restaurant you start to cry  Baby, we'll just improvise  Well, plan B looks like  Dominoes' pizza in the candle light  Then we'll tippy toe to our room  Make a little love that's overdue  But somebody had a bad dream  Mama and daddy  Can meand my teddy  Come in to sleep in between?   Yeah it's ok. It's so nice.  It's just another day in paradise.  Well, there's no place that  I'd rather be  Well, it's two hearts  And one dream  I wouldn't trade it for anything  And I ask the lord every night  For just another day in paradise   Well, it's ok. It's so nice.  It's just another day in paradise.  Well, there's no place that  I'd rather be  Two hearts  And one dream  I wouldn't trade it for anything  And I ask the lord every night  For just another day in paradise  For just another day in paradise   Well, it's the kids screaming. The phone ringing  Just another day  Well, it's Friday. You're late  Oh yeah, it's just another day in paradise       - urlLink Nat-a-lee  giggled about a boy at 10:08 AM var w108274010646253293=escape('');   urlLink  Girly Giggles [   .]             Stand up, stretch, go pee and remember that I LOVE YOU!
