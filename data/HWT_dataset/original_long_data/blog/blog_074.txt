I really have to agree that IE (Internet Explorer) is the worst among the number of browsers available. Even with the new pop-up blocker feature, it basically still sux a lot.  1) Opera - The design of this browser is less than sleek (it's quite square-ish)and it carries ad banenr as well. good thing is it provides tabs which mean u can open many sites at one time without having many new windows appearing.  basically alrite, shows in you detail the downloading of the site (the progress, such as the current downloading speed etc.) basically, i would love to use this if some improvements are made. be careful, embed media players etc. will not work... with pop-up blocker and password remembring tool. downloading is faster than other browsers too. certain things may not be viewed too.  2) Mozilla - Nothing special. Looks like IE but it's a bit more stable and faster than IE. Includes pop-up blocker and password remembring tool. some problem may appear because of tabs.  3) Safari - I like this browser the most actually. it's the most reliable and the fastest. Too bad, it only works with Macintosh. It's fast in downloading applets too. anyway, don't try to download it to windows. it won't work. i liked the interface quite a lot, sleek design.   4) Netscape - Sleek design. love the interface. but nothing special. i dun tink it has pop-up blocker too. but there's still a password manager.
