>      What can i say... Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was bloody brillant!! i went to see it right after school on friday. Yes, that's right i saw it on the opening day!! (Thanks mike for the ticket) Daniel Radcliffe aka Harry Potter had grown up soo fast and he is sooo cute!! Malofy too haha. okay well... the movie was all the great i give it 4 1/2 stars because they left out important detailS!! Overall, the movie was good... I didn't really dress up to get the movie but i was wearing a Ravenclaw tie even though, I like Gryffindors better. I might go see the movie again like in 2 more weeks.   Movies I have to see this summer: -The Notebook (one of my favorite books :]) -Spiderman 2 -A Cinderella Story  That's all i can think of right now! Enjoy the pictures!!       Me, getting ready the wicked movie          A bunch of us waiting for the movie to start (bad pic of me by the way)         Me and my favorite character Sirius Black
