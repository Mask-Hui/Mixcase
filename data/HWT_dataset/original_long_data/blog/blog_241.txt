The last of the grades came through today:  Civil Procedure: A-  (YIIIPPPPIIIIEEEE!!!!!!)  Contracts: C (Which is quite good, really.  Exactly what I anticipated and not as low as I feared.)  Research and Writing Paper a.k.a the only graded assignment for the semester: A- (see the Civ Pro comment)  KICK ASS!!!!  Nice little finish to the day, semester, year.  The class standings will be out in February, but I'm not too worried about them.  My GPA will be higher than 2.0 and that's worth getting drunk over.  Not that I'm going to, that is.  Have Property first thing tomorrow morning, after all.    Had a really good day even before checking out the grades.  Spent the day running errands and getting started on the reading for this week.  Three hours of Criminal Law reading at the Daily Grind always puts a gal in a good mood.  Especially when the spectrum of the 36 pages spanned from loud yelling at a parade to the constitutionality of same-sex sodomy; Yay!  And can I just say: one of the reasons I love this town so is the fact that it feels like March in January.  March will no doubt feel like December, but for now, it's a nice switch.
