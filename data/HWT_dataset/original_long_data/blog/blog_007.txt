The notebook (2004): not the tear jerker i was hoping for. Kinda flat in the middle. But its a really good story and has an amazing ending. Acting is very good, as are the locations, production design, and all that jazz. Only see if you absolutely love romantic drama-type movies. Got my dance on today. Trying to plan a camping trip this weekend. Most likely it will fall through as stuff like that usually does. Trying to get it all planned out with the firm for this week cuz we gots a midterm on thursday. So wednesday we're meeting at my place 10:(30), having breakfast, doing the dance game, studying, doing the dance game, eating lunch, doing the dance game, then class at 6. Should be a good day, although this does mean me getting up before noon and cleaning the freaking house. Getting a little frustrated cuz our lil lyndsie is taking this whole adult responsibility, lets get a job thing, a little too serious. Poor girl works about 90 hours this week, has her bro's wedding over the weekend, then comes back next week to work another 80 hours. Luckily we get to study with her on thursday (if all goes well) for the midterm. That's bout it. I'm ready for this week to be over with. I'm ready for this summer to end, actually, i want classes to end. I want a summer where i can just hang out with my peeps. I can't even imagine what that would be like. Where did my summer vacations go? k, i'm gone. I can't stand carolyn (however i might be up for some extra credit if she offers it), all music from kill bill, gta3, and vice city rawks, and today gainesville, fl was a high of 89, low of 72, with isolated thunderstorms. Not too shabby i'd say.
