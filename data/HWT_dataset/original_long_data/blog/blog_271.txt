Wow, camping wasn't half bad! it wuz fully bad. I kid. But seriously, busch gardens is kul! the big bad wolf, may be big and bad, but it is most definitely not a wolf. You were right, tom, i'll give you yur five bucks. Also, it was not scary, atho i was scared stiff b4hand. I guess all my awesome florida experinces at rockin' roller coaster did nothing for me here but get me on the coaster. Escape from pompei? piece of cake. In fact, there was a little car thing that went right through pompei and out. Talk about convenient! of course there was a slight wet drop at the end... And avoiding its splash while other ppl were on it was fun. Now it's off to comp sci hw. Dont' go, spring break
