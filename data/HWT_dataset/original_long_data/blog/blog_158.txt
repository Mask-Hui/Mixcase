A life so full, one of grace, daily i strive, to balance the pace. From the heart, truth so bold, desires denied, trust in the old. Beliefs are soon shattered, confusion exists. Faith so shallow, praying for bliss. The mists of the path, foggy and dense, lessons of suffering, joy sings from the fence. Slowly i learn, why must i suffer? to give so easy, to receive is tougher. Open the heart, risk to be taken, balance of two, not be forsaken. Alone i now sit, life scattered and tattered. Of my own making, does it really matter? strength from within, now i must find. Depend on one self, god in due time. Dlt Â© july 11 2004
