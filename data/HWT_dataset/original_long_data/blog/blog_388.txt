I think my left nut has formed, or i'm just tired of putting myself (and i'm sure all my friends to a degree) through hell. When i talk to her tomorrow, i'm going to lay it all out... See where i can go from here. Either way it turns out, i will do it. I'm not ashamed to say that i'm very nervous and may have a difficult time sleeping tonight. I know this kind of thing is old hat to many people (probably most people), but it's not to me. I can't wait for tomorrow... And i'm dreading it.
