I think my left nut has formed, or I'm just tired of putting myself (and I'm sure all my friends to a degree) through hell.   When  I talk to her tomorrow, I'm going to lay it all out... see where I can go from here.  Either way it turns out, I will do it.  I'm not ashamed to say that I'm very nervous and may have a difficult time sleeping tonight.  I know this kind of thing is old hat to many people (probably most people), but it's not to me.  I can't wait for tomorrow... and I'm dreading it.
