Evil let's do a little mental exercise, shall we? c'mon, it'll be fun! the picture above is that of a baby walker. I trust you've all seen one of these contraptions in action at one point or another (despite the meagerness of your lives). Now try to imagine a similar jig... Not for babies, but for dogs! doggie slips into a little harness supported by a lightweight aluminum frame. The whole thing is on wheels and doggy scoots along the ground with the effective body weight of a mutt on the moon. Can you see it? well get this. I saw a woman walking her dog in such a contraption today! (i wish i had my camera with me, but i didn't.) the little dog was scooting along free and easy. Barely an effort. When i caught hold of this, i did what came most naturally to me. Now, those of you who know me probably know that sometimes i say out loud thoughts that are in my head. You might also know that sometimes i have no idea how loud i'm talking, despite the fact that i'm talking really damn loud. As this woman and her pooch cross in front of me, i go: 'damn woman, your dog needs to toughen up!' she shot a nasty glare in my direction, as if to say, 'go put on a rice hat and build me a railroad, chinaman.' okay, maybe i was overly-defensive there. But in any event, there i was... Standing next to a woman whom i had clearly just insulted. I weighed my options: 1. Pretend i never said anything in the first place and give the woman a bewildered look. Bank on the fact that her being a white, older woman from the upper east side also makes her cuh-ray-zee. See if she will crumble under her own self doubt. 2. Think of a witty follow-up line to diffuse the tension. The downside of this option is that i have to think of a witty follow-up line. 3. Run away. In that moment of truth, i went with option 3. I think my mom, my friends, my minister, every teacher i've had from kindergarten thru 12th grade, and my parole officer would all be proud of me.
