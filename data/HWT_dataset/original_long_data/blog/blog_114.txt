So yesterday i had to chance to see the one dc 'talking head' i have always wanted to see. I don't usually speak to famous people when i see them, though i do tend to look them in the eye. But i always said that if i ever met michele martin of abc news ('this week') and pbs ('washington week'), that i would tell her what a right-on woman i think she is. I had a whole 30-second speech planned out. Yesterday, june 17, on my way home, my moment arrived. The lovely michele martin was getting into a cab near the abc studios off of conn ave and was talking to 2 teenage girls standing about 10 feet away from her. Not sure who they were, but i don't think they were her kids (she just had a baby). I tried ever so to be polite and not interrupt, so i slowed way down, waiting for my window of opportunity. When it became clear they weren't going to stop talking, i went for broke. Standing in the middle of the street between filene's and the mayflower i rooted myself into the cement, pointed at her (which caught her eye) and screamed i love you - you rock! (emphasis on rock). She was about 20 feet away and looked at me and yelled back -not missing a beat- 'thank you, but don't tell me, tell them!' nodding to the girls. I have no idea who they were, but the girls didn't see me and i just kept going. It was not your usual dc encounter, but i think i made my point, albeit looking like a slightly crazed fan in the process. Here is a photo/bio of urllink michele, my belle .
