Hmm. 1 - huge belly on an otherwise skinny frame - yuck! anyone remember the timbertoes from children's highlights? that's me. 2 - i had an extra bone in each foot. Blocked my arch, had it removed when i was 13. End of my football career, except that i already told you how i was built. The career would have gone away anyhow. 3 - crooked nose - or maybe asymmetrical is a better word. More syllables anyhow. It's just not centered right on my face. 4 - see the rabbit blog . Then read the url. The shame, the shame... Nice blog, though. Daf (who has more, but he's really bumming himself out).
