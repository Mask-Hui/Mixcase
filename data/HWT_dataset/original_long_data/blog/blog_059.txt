Intro the plan was simple. 3 guys - me, sander and shelley - went to a youth hostel without parents for 4 days story day 1 day 1 started with the arrvival at the youth hostel. Everything looked real fine but we could just stay for half an hour cause we agreed with some friends at oostende (marco en alexander). The swimming pool of oostende was fine we where there for 4 or 5 hours. There where some special effects in the water slide, really it was like u where in the universe -> funny :). After that we just took the tram to the hostel and started unpakking.
