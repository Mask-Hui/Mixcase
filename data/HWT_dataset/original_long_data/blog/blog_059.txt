Hmm.   1 - huge belly on an otherwise skinny frame - yuck!  Anyone remember the Timbertoes from Children's Highlights?  That's me.   2 - I had an extra bone in each foot.  Blocked my arch, had it removed when I was 13.  End of my football career, except that I already told you how I was built.  The career would have gone away anyhow.   3 - crooked nose - or maybe asymmetrical is a better word.  More syllables anyhow.  It's just not centered right on my face.   4 - see the   RABBIT BLOG  .  Then read the URL.  the shame, the shame...  Nice blog, though.   Daf (who has more, but he's really bumming himself out).
