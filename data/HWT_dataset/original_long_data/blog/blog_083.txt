of course i procrastinated this entire weekend.  i've got too much to read and too much to write in too little time.  the first summer session ends in three and a half weeks... and then i go right into the last session.  the flames lost tonight... but they put up quite a battle... one goal was the difference between a 3-1 series lead and a 2-2 series tie.  maybe they'll win on thur in tampa... and win the series back home for game 6.  lots of people are supposedly coming home for july 4th weekend... i'm pretty excited about that.  hmmm... what else... i'm ready for  urlLink anchorman  to come out.  will ferrell is such a funny person... he goes all out and over the top... how can you not laugh?   urlLink the incredibles  should be funny too.  i think i'll plan on a trip to new york in august after chem's over with.  i'll be able to stay a bit longer this time... maybe a week or so.  so my linux drive in my linux box died... i can't recover the files that are on it.  it took my beos install with it.  i put in a spare drive, and want to run solaris x86 on it just for fun.  the install wouldn't let me get into the x-win portion of the install.  so... i'm going to recheck the requirements... and if that doesn't work... it's back to linux i guess.  anyone know what the advantages of reiserfs over ext3 are?  or reiserfs over any other file systems are?  all my guesses have been wrong so far... but the list is definitely shortened.  who are you mystery person?  when i find out... i will get you back =].  ok... i seriously have to read now... maybe get through more than 10 pages every 3 hours or so.
