Weeellllll I just got back from Survivor.  So freakin awesome. Seriously.  I'm so tired.  Stayed at Merediths friday night...definitely went to bed at 3. Got up at 6 something. It was at Camp Edgewood.  Did all the challenges. Rentrop was my partner lol.  Swam in the lake, defeated the wasps.  So much stuff. It was just...awesome. It's bad when it takes a trip like that to make you think, but awesome when you actually do think. They got us up at 5 to do the obstacle course, I'm tired.  Gonna go wash the lake water out of my hair..then sleep. So awesome...lol.
