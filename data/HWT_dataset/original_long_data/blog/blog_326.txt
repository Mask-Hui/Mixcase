OK, several things to say: 1) Our unintentional palm tree (I promised to say more about it) happened when my uncle came to visit from--that's right--ENGLAND!  We bought a coconut (don't ask me why, I was, like, 4 years old), but never ate it.  It eventually went frot (yes, it IS a word--South African) and we chucked it into the front garden.  And, well, wha'dya know, a palm tree grew!  TADA!  2) I think a black hole exploded and blew up another star.  Could someone please find out?  I just saw a headline.  3) Will be posted later, seeing as I am being called by my parental units to clear the table, unload, and then reload te dishwasher.  Then, I suppose I better get a move on Soto's homework.  Plus Sands's, Pereira's, Szmulewicz's, Izquierdo's and Buitragos's.  Ali, what exactly  was  Pereira's homework?
