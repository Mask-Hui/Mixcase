Ok, several things to say: 1) our unintentional palm tree (i promised to say more about it) happened when my uncle came to visit from--that's right--england! we bought a coconut (don't ask me why, i was, like, 4 years old), but never ate it. It eventually went frot (yes, it is a word--south african) and we chucked it into the front garden. And, well, wha'dya know, a palm tree grew! tada! 2) i think a black hole exploded and blew up another star. Could someone please find out? i just saw a headline. 3) will be posted later, seeing as i am being called by my parental units to clear the table, unload, and then reload te dishwasher. Then, i suppose i better get a move on soto's homework. Plus sands's, pereira's, szmulewicz's, izquierdo's and buitragos's. Ali, what exactly was pereira's homework?
