It's only nearing one in the morning but i'm getting really tired. I wanted to stay up until i got to talk to joe about recording today, so, here i am, keeping myself busy. I might not even get to talk to him tonight, so maybe i'll just go to bed. Sunday is the 4th of july and i have a feeling i will be spending in trying to get farther in final fantasy. I don't have anywhere to go, unless i go downtown for the show and the fireworks by myself. Joe is going to be listening to the bands, then maybe drinking, whitney won't be home, and i don't feel like hanging out with my other friends. My brother is in westchester until next week and i am so happy, i could shit. If this is what it's going to be like when he finally gets his own place then i might creme my pants. He's recording his cd with his band and shooting their video. Jumping the gun a bit i think. I honestly think that they are wasting their $2000, but, who knows, maybe they will be famous and josh will feel pity for me. Well, i gues i am gonna get going, i have a feeling my computer is going to freeze soon.
