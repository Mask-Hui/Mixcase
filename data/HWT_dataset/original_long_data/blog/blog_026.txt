*** im retarded today is a slow day at work. My shift today is 6:30am-3:30pm, since the receptionist is gone. It's not too terrible because abby lent me her sweet rollickin car and soul crooner bart davenport comforted me as i sped across the bay bridge... On the mortification front, xx emailed me and asked me to be his 'im' buddy and i had no idea how to do this, so of course i replied 'yes'. I went to yahoo and downloaded instant messenger and i thought that was enough. Then he asked me for my name. Huh??? i sent him three messages and i figure that would take care of it, but he never replied. Am i supposed to hit something, like 'check mail'? i am absolutely clueless. He probably realized the extent of my ineptitude because he started emailing me within the office email system again. That was embarrassing and made my cheeks burn with shame. I'm stupid!!! i only slept 4 hours last night, so i'm also grumpy and cranky. I'm mad at xx too because when i told him he should use colons as punctutation more often, he wrote back 'tough:shit.' he will be ignored for the rest of the day because no one emails to me that way, no one! it is also the lack of sleep that is making me mean. I want to punish him and make him cry for writing that to me. Why?
