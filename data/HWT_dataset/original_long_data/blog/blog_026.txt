It's only nearing one in the morning but I'm getting really tired. I wanted to stay up until I got to talk to Joe about recording today, so, here I am, keeping myself busy. I might not even get to talk to him tonight, so maybe I'll just go to bed.  Sunday is the 4th of July and I have a feeling I will be spending in trying to get farther in Final Fantasy. I don't have anywhere to go, unless I go  downtown for the show and the fireworks by myself. Joe is going to be listening to the bands, then maybe drinking, Whitney won't be home, and I don't feel like hanging out with my other friends.  My brother is in Westchester until next week and I am so happy, I could shit. If this is what it's going to be like when he finally gets his own place then I might creme my pants. He's recording his CD with his band and shooting their video. Jumping the gun a bit I think. I honestly think that they are wasting their $2000, but, who knows, maybe they will be famous and Josh will feel pity for me. Well, I gues I am gonna get going, I have a feeling my computer is going to freeze soon.
