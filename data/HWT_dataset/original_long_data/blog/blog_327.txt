And for memories sake: theme song said the one in the dark to the one in the light, wonderin what i was doin out in the night, see the waves are too high and the winds are too strong, wonderin what else could go wrong. *thunders crashin, lightnings flashing , waves are splashin my anchor holds, winds are blowin, the tides are towin , but i am knowin my anchor holds, you bought my life when you saved my soul, you're my anchor of hope. Child i know you are tired, said the one in the light, but i havent left you there lost in the night, and all through your life, through the storms and the tides, i am right there by your side........
