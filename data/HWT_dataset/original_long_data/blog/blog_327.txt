And for memories sake: THEME SONG  Said the one in the dark to the one in the light,  Wonderin what i was doin out in the night, See the waves are too high and the winds are too strong,  Wonderin what else could go wrong.   *thunders crashin,  lightnings flashing , waves are splashin  my anchor holds,  winds are blowin,  the tides are towin , but i am knowin my anchor holds,  you bought my life when you saved my soul,  you're my anchor of hope.  child i know you are tired,  said the one in the light,  but i havent left you there lost in the night,  and all through your life,  through the storms and the tides,  i am right there by your side........
