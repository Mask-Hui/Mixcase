Well folks, for the past two days i had been revising like a horse for my maths (mechanics) exam, i knew it would be hard, but i kept revising and revising, doing past papers and so on. Even today in the morning before the exam, which was in the afternoon, i was revising for around 4 hours. As i went into the exam, i wasn't that confident, i had already decdied in my mind that i was going to re-sit the exam in november. Let me just say, the paper was fucking solid! every question was hard. The things i had revised didn't come up, it was just awful. I flopped it big time. I mean which wanker came up with a question paper so difficult. All my mates found it difficult - even the further maths people said it was hard. So i'm going to re-sit it. Also, a few people have said they don't like my attitude. I mean what the fuck? just because i don't worry in person and show it off to everyone, 'oh god im gonna fail, oh god the girls messed me around, oh god i ant got no money' does that make me a bad person? no. If i don't want to show my emotion in public deal with people! i got the same shit from my head of sixth form. When he suspended me for two days, for something a teacher had told him i said, which in fact i never did, he said that 'i don't seem concerned'.. ...of course i'm concerend, i've got a spotless record before now and your suspended, people will look down on me when i go for uni and job applications, i mean what did he expect me to do, cry? tut. Big brother is back! shamon! hopefully this year will be better than last years. But i predict the theme for this one will be sex, sex, and more sex, which i for will not be tuning into. I don't wanna see two rats going at it. Righty - thats enough of a rant for today. Schumacher to win the grand prix on sunday. *leaving* currently listening 2: baby bash (i think thats what he's called) - sugar sugar
