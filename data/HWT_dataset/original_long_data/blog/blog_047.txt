Well folks, for the past two days I had been revising like a horse for my Maths (Mechanics) exam, I knew it would be hard, but I kept revising and revising, doing past papers and so on.  Even today in the morning before the exam, which was in the afternoon, I was revising for around 4 hours.  As I went into the exam, I wasn't that confident, I had already decdied in my mind that I was going to re-sit the exam in November. Let me just say, the paper was FUCKING SOLID! Every question was hard. The things I had revised didn't come up, it was just awful.  I flopped it big time. I mean which wanker came up with a question paper so difficult. All my mates found it difficult - even the further maths people said it was hard.  So I'm going to re-sit it.  Also, a few people have said they don't like my attitude. I mean what the fuck?  Just because I don't worry in person and show it off to everyone, 'oh god im gonna fail, oh god the girls messed me around, oh god i ant got no money' does that make me a bad person? No. If I don't want to show my emotion in public deal with people!  I got the same shit from my Head of Sixth Form. When he suspended me for two days, for something a teacher had told him I said, which in fact I NEVER did, he said that 'I don't seem concerned'..  ...Of course I'm concerend, I've got a spotless record before now and your suspended, people will look down on me when I go for Uni and Job Applications, I mean what did he expect me to do, Cry?  Tut.   Big Brother is BACK! SHAMON! Hopefully this year will be better than last years. But I predict the theme for this one will be sex, sex, and more sex, which I for will not be tuning into. I don't wanna see two rats going at it.  Righty - thats enough of a rant for today.  Schumacher to win the Grand Prix on Sunday.  *leaving*  Currently Listening 2: Baby Bash (i think thats what he's called) - Sugar Sugar
