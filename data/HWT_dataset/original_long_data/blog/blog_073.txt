Well, once again, i got to miss a urllink bad religion show. I have been a fan for 7 years now, and i have missed at least 8 possible shows. The first few were because of that gigantic thumb i lived under; i called it 'parental guidance'. During that middle period, i missed the shows because the album they were touring for frankly sucked. Fast forward to 2000, the may release of urllink the new america and i started to get excited with the band again. Preliminary reports of this tour got me even more excited since they were playing mostly older songs (read: good songs)! they come to se michigan on tour for this new album, and i am too busy to go to the show . At least urllink the daily published a urllink nice article about them yesterday.
