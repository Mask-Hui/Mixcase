Hopefully she gets what she deserves.... But i know what you mean. My saying is, if someone can get caught, i will be the one that gets it- so that's why i tend to play by the rules and not stray more than an inch from 'em. And i'm a *horrible* liar, so i couldn't do any better than dig deeper if i did get caught doing something i shouldn't- lol thanks for the condolences- wow, i'd find that really creepy if i dreamed of someone being pregnant and then there was a death- that's heavy symbolism! oh, gosh, i'm sooooo excited now- i hope he mailed all of us levengals who are waiting for pics our copies too! woo hoo!!!! :-d jan- any luck????? ok- i know if you got yours too, then mine's gotta be there either monday or tuesday- (denise- if i remember correctly, you're on the east coast, so it would make sense that you'd get yours fairly close to the postmarked date).
