Well, once again, I got to miss a  urlLink Bad Religion  show.  I have been a fan for 7 years now, and I have missed at least 8 possible shows.  The first few were because of that gigantic thumb I lived under; I called it 'Parental Guidance'.  During that middle period, I missed the shows because the album they were touring for frankly sucked.  Fast forward to 2000, the May release of   urlLink The New America   and I started to get excited with the band again.   Preliminary reports of this tour got me even more excited since they were playing mostly older songs (read:  good songs)!   They come to SE Michigan on tour for this new album, and  I am too busy to go to the show .    At least  urlLink The Daily  published a  urlLink nice article  about them yesterday.
