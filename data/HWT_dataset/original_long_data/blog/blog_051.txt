Today jen might come over. We might do my belly button (piercing). I was supposed to go to the comic book shop today. But my mom started being a bitch for no reason. So yea. And im still not talking to my dad. Although my mom is, when last week she claimed to be soooo pissed at him. Yea right. &amp;if jen doesnt come over, i mgith just do my piercing myself. Ive found myself watching the olympics more than i thought i would. Everyone knows im sooo not a sports person. Ive def been watching the swimming cause michael phelps is sex in a package. I watched the running cause i love their shoes. I watched the volleyball cause those chicks are hot. I watched the womens diving. I like the criticism. I mean, i kinda picked up on some things the judges frowned upon, so when then slowed the dives down, or even when i was watching them at 'regular speed' i would be like 'oh, she arched going into the water'.. Or she splashed too much.. Or her legs were spread.. Or she was to far out.. Or she wasnt watching the water. Listening to fftl right now. Waiting for phone calls. I really should be cleanign my room. I wont really have the chance when school starts. Whatever.
