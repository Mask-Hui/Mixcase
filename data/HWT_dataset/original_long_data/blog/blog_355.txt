If you were wondering what's the matter with the pics of children, well it's for a project that targets you.. The people of the free world.. To donate money to the orphanage.. I'm currently trying so hard to find pictures to use as an advertisement.. Bloody damn competition's in a weeks' time.. Have to go climb tomorrow.. So stressed out.. Urllink children urllink children1 urllink children2 children3 holy crap.. Being creative isn't easy.. Being a perfectionist makes it worse.. You'd never feel satisfied with the work that you have and yet you do not have enough time to do a better job.. In time i hope i gradually get better at this.. I so gotta climb tomorrow.. Couldn't even sleep last night and ended up redecorating my whole room until morning and grabbed some breakfast before i fell into a deep slumber.. Thank you rae for helping me out.. Sigh.. Not many people that i can depend on these days.. I haven't spoken to kel in a long time.. The last i hear she's doing fine.. I hope you are, pray that you are.. Got an unexpected call a couple days ago.. I was so surprised that she called me.. Hmm.. People do remember me.. *smile* linkin, crap.. Super lost.. Lost in malaysia.. Haha.. Wormies.. Lost in other friends.. Don.. Lost in job.. Jefferson.. Lost in home.. Jason.. Lost in sarawak.. Hsang.. Lost in bu.. Jeffrey.. Lost in with adel.. Gerald.. Lost in weedland.. Celeste.. Busy like hell.. Chong.. We meet twice a week.. Climbing yeah!! lemme tell you bout this guy.. One down to earth person and i love hanging out with him.. Very good at climbing and practically knows everyone there is at the gym! i hope you stick with this sport my friend.. I hope we be friends for life.. U too celeste.. Sometimes, we all need a dose of obsession.. Whether it's with women, friends, job, home, weed or climbing(like me)..
