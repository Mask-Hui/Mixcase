First Post:  This one is a test- I want to see what happens when my words become public personas.  What do you they look like?  How do they get along with other people's words?  Will they have high profile relationships with celebrity words?  I hope to make this forum a comfortable place for my words.  I am going to call it 'Girl Power for the Educated Woman'  I think this has the potential to be a book title someday and I like it.  Anyone who might be reading this can have the following expectations of Uberbliss/Amanda:                  - Vingettes about life: Dating, friendship, dancing and working                  - At least passing reference to NickToons                  - Wisdom. That's right wisdom. Keep an eye on it, I think its gonna be good. Amanda
