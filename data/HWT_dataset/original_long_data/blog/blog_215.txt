saw this saying somewhere the last  few days and it hit very close to home on me.  As another chapter of my life closes, a new one begins to unfold. It's just one of the few surprises that Life brings into our lives. Changes for the better or worse , it's not up to us to decide , but we can help make these setbacks into opportunities. For there's a rainbow after a downpour.  The week is almost halfway thru and I'm hope that it will move even faster. Cannot wait for my short break overseas. a time to destress from all my army and Red cross work committments.   tonight got another meeting to attend to. can't beileve that i'm actually more busy during my leaves than when i'm Not. Argh! But i shall not complain too much. For this is what i like to do, this passion in my heart to do this line of work is one that i hope will never go out . that's why i'm still surviving all these while.   until the next time, catcha ard.
