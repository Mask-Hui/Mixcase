Introductions it has come to my attention that i haven't introduced everyone. I will not, in bridget jones manner, say things like 'justin enjoys correcting people's grammar and belching before he kisses his girlfriend.' i will say: clare is a year older than me and lived in farc until she went to england the second semester of my sophomore year. The first time i met clare was at a party they dragged some freshman to and she was very drunk and sat on a glass table without realizing it was glass. It was at that same party that paul, justin, and i talked about opening a brothel. Kate is a year younger than me. She moved out of farc when i did and worked at the front desk. She loves penny lane from almost famous and is dating our former captain condom, adam henerey. Erin is a year younger than me as well. She was a pa during my last year in farc and her fig had to have a stern talking-to about not having sex with the masses. She is an english major and is the proud owner of a kristin buel blanket. Abby is a pirate. She sails the high seas with her younger sister, olivia, who holds the position of littlest crack ho. She enjoys calling the 80s. Sara h is adrian's wife. I didn't believe she existed until i moved here because everybody talked about her but i never actually met her. I thought adrian just had a made-up wife or something. (he's done stranger things - remember 'spooky-wooky'?) she has a fabulous book collection and is probably too smart to be my friend. I'm sure she'll figure that out soon enough. Dave is dave of the fabulous hair. As i've said many times before, he once wore all the clothes in the lost and found and he owns his own tuxedo. You know who nobody talks about any more? john of farc. I loved john of farc, especially when he wanted everyone to have a rascal, one of those motorized chairs. He made it a third floor priority.
