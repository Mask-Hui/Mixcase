Yesterday kent found out i had applied for housing and was furious. Now he's very agreeable and wanting to work things out. I wonder how long that will last. I went through with the application process, though. There's a waiting list of about 2 months. This keeps my options open. He's even offered to go walking with me! today when i woke up, i didn't wake him. After his usual 8 a.m. To 4 p.m. Shift yesterday, he had to work midnight to 4 a.m. Because of a problem with one of the other guards at his post. I took cayla with me for the 2 mile walk. She rode her bike. We reached the halfway point, going on a route that took us out of town. On the way back, she seemed to be lagging, so i asked her if she wanted daddy to come get her. She said yes, so i called him (thank goodness for cell phones!). He came to pick her up and asked why i didn't have him go with us. I said i would go back with them in the car and we could walk together. This meant that we all had to go, because i don't feel right leaving amanda and cayla alone, even in our small town. We live in a mobile home, notorious for fast fires, although the kids wouldn't be doing anything to cause one - call me overprotective. So, we walked to the park, left the kids there and walked a little further, then back home. After lunch, i took a nap. That's about my whole day so far, now it's time to go to work. I've got a headache - probably from not drinking dr. Pepper (my downfall) until lunchtime. I'm making up for that now.
