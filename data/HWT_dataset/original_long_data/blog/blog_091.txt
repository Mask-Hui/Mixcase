Hidey-ho, squirrel-loving marsupials. Sorry, melissa; no 'i have never's' today because i'm too tired and i don't have much time. Assisting fat cats in their execise that they can't do because they're too fat to move.. Ha ha, what a concept. Hey, have any of you guys met any non-existent squirrels? i've seen three, and got an autograph and a picture taken with one. Lemme hear your stories regarding such mysterious and elusive creatures. Boot camp was fun this morning. We did 113 jumping jacks, then as many push-ups then sit-ups aas we could do in 2 minutes. I got 91 sit-ups and 63 push-ups. Whew! hard stuff! but then came the easy part: the one-and-a-half mile run. I only got a measly 8:53. What a slowpoke i am. Not really- that's an average time for me; other people got like 20 minutes. I'm still not familiar enough or brave enough to really start cheering people on, but that's what i'm gonna have to do the rest of the time. Yee-haw! i will try my best to do everything they want me to. The leg lifts were hard because my legs didn't wanna straighten out, so my thighs were really hurting instead of my abs. C'est la vie. Pray for kelly and me to do well the next two weeks, please! we'll need it! speaking of prayer and its wonders, i got a 79 in calculus!!! i had a 51.6 at progress reports, and now it's a freaking 79!!! yahoooo!!! andrew simmons had a 79, then asked mrs. Mallery, 'can i have a b?' and she was like, 'yeah.' i had a 78, and i said 'can i have a b too?' but she just said, 'the ebst i can do for you is a 79.' but i was glad with that. Hard work pays off! try it sometime, you lazy-@$$ people...americans; sheesh. Mmm, can't really think of anything else right now, so here's the song of the day: 'what have you been doing lately?' by relient k. I swear, their whole cd is going to have been songs of the day by the time i'm done... 'pardon me while i throw up... I guess some people never grow up... What happened to the salvation you claimed? it breaks my heart to see how much you've changed, whoa-ooaa; it breaks my heart...to...see...how...much..you've changed...' ok, i'll wrap it up for now. American childhood followed by grateful sleep calls to me... I'm out like the bellybutton of a newborn... (i made that one up myself. Pretty stupid, huh?) god bless
