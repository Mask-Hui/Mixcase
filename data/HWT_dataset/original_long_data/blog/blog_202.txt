Music for the Day: 94.7 fm    &nbsp;  Almost didn't make it to work on time. There's some kinda huge accident at 14th and Constitution that is making traffic hell in Virginia. Thankfully I was able to skillyfully get my car from the far left lane to the far right, and was able to get my ass onto Route 50. All of this, of course, means nothing to anyone unless you live around here...so nevermind. Basically I am happy to be sitting here as opposed to still sitting in my car.     Yesterday Sara decided to google me...and lo and behold, the email I wrote to Ivan Meisel on ESPN.com was published online! I had no idea; I thought it wasn't the most well-written argument but I guess someone thought otherwise. Though I can't tell if he's mocking me...take a look and see for yourself.    &nbsp;  urlLink http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=maisel_ivan&amp;id=1819248    It's towards the middle of the page.     &nbsp;  Also watched the Kerry speech last night. I think it was really well done. I loved that he was&nbsp;showing his nervousness; it just makes him seem less political and more normal person. I thought he made excellent points and definitely should have left the right-wingers quaking in their cowboy boots. The more I see of Kerry, the more I like him. I think he'll make an excellent president. I must remember to try and volunteer for the campaign...I was also moved to tears when Kerry's co-vets were on the stage, introducing Max Cleland who ultimately introduced Kerry. It was so touching, and really puts the character of Kerry in an even more positive light.     &nbsp;   I can't wait for November.
