So today I spent sitting in front of the television.&nbsp; Sometimes it's my only solice in life.&nbsp; Everyone deserves one thing right.&nbsp; Even this was giving me no joy today seeing as everything was promoting the untimly end of even the most perfect relationship.&nbsp; Poor Brittany Murphy, Gag.&nbsp; Getting myself out of bed I thought that going to the mall to buy a new white purse for this weekends wedding would make me feel better but once again to no avail.&nbsp; I ended up turning right around to go get take out to eat, in bed.&nbsp; This is one of those days where I wish I could sleep forever.&nbsp; Something hit me the other day and ever since I have had a hard time dealing with it.&nbsp; Not that I can sleep normally anyway.&nbsp; So here I sit at 12:17 am waiting for a stupid phone call that I didn't want in the first place... There is a strong possibility that I won't even get that unwanted phone call.&nbsp; But like an idiot I'll wait and wait and not sleep.&nbsp; I want to be a person who doesn't care.&nbsp; Why should I?&nbsp; Im not deserving of a decent relationship anyway because of the kind of person I am right?&nbsp; He's the saint for being with me, hahaha.&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp; This is exactly what I told myself I wouldn't do.&nbsp; Im so good at letting myself down, forget about you.&nbsp; This mental kahh kahh really gets to me after a while.&nbsp;     You know it's serious when leather accessories don't even help.... Viva Prada!&nbsp; I will return.
