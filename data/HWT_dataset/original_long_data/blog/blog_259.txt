So today i spent sitting in front of the television.&nbsp; sometimes it's my only solice in life.&nbsp; everyone deserves one thing right.&nbsp; even this was giving me no joy today seeing as everything was promoting the untimly end of even the most perfect relationship.&nbsp; poor brittany murphy, gag.&nbsp; getting myself out of bed i thought that going to the mall to buy a new white purse for this weekends wedding would make me feel better but once again to no avail.&nbsp; i ended up turning right around to go get take out to eat, in bed.&nbsp; this is one of those days where i wish i could sleep forever.&nbsp; something hit me the other day and ever since i have had a hard time dealing with it.&nbsp; not that i can sleep normally anyway.&nbsp; so here i sit at 12:17 am waiting for a stupid phone call that i didn't want in the first place... There is a strong possibility that i won't even get that unwanted phone call.&nbsp; but like an idiot i'll wait and wait and not sleep.&nbsp; i want to be a person who doesn't care.&nbsp; why should i?&nbsp; im not deserving of a decent relationship anyway because of the kind of person i am right?&nbsp; he's the saint for being with me, hahaha.&nbsp; whatever.&nbsp; this is exactly what i told myself i wouldn't do.&nbsp; im so good at letting myself down, forget about you.&nbsp; this mental kahh kahh really gets to me after a while.&nbsp; you know it's serious when leather accessories don't even help.... Viva prada!&nbsp; i will return.
