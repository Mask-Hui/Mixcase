Hi. I'm jonjb. This site pertains to simple folk instruments you can make yourself. I made a whole slew of flutes, drums and the like and would like to share my knowledge about how i made them. I already have two websites, one of which concentrates on this subject. The other has a special section. Actually, one sit e is an outgrowth of the other. The first site is at urllink http://www.geocities.com/jonjb.geo/ the other is at urllink http://www.geocities.com/jonjb2a/ if you want to get the nitty gritty of musicbyyou, please visit the second site first. The first site has a bunch of poetry, cartoons and what i hope passes for humor (including a parody of shakespeare's 'romeo and juliet'). Meanwhile, i hope to post photos and sound clips on musicbyyou. Hopefully they will serve as inspiration. Making these instruments is not all that difficult and you may use materials commonly found around the house and even outside (such as fallen twigs and branches). Most require hand tools, rather than power tools. With hopefully a minimum of effort, you can make music in almost no time at all.
