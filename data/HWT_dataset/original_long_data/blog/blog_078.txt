As you probably read earlier, i went to an allergy study and made $440. My mom freaked out last night when i told her i was going to spend most of it on books and like lost it. She said she wasn't going to take me to any more studies and all this shit. So this morning i ripped up the check i was sending to amazon.com and transferred a bunch of money to my savings account and i guess i'll just buy the other books i want one by one or something. Its sad how much she freaked out though. I dont know why i conformed to what she wanted me to do, and how to spend my money and all that. I mean - she shouldn't be doing that. She was telling me with books i'd have nothing to show for my money, which so isn't true. I still would have quite a bit to show for it. Just on a smaller scale. I wouldn't have like a tv or something, but i'd have a whole hell of a lotta books. Anyways i have to be off to pe and get my amazon.com order straightened out. Out- ps: we're performing today in dance. Should be interesting. Unfortunately my audiance is going to be small.
