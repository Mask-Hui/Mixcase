Before, i really don't appreciate what my parents have been doing for me. Now, because of someone's blog, i began to realize all the pain, the sufferings, the stress they've been doing just for me to be healthy, to study at a great school and for me to grow good and all.&nbsp; i really don't know how to show my parents and brothers how they really mean to me; how i appreciate each and everything they do for me; all the love they show me; and everything! i didn't see it before. I always took it for granted. But for some people who doesn't have their parents with them, they would be really greatful for those kind of suffering their parents would do just for them. I don't know how to say 'i love you' to my parents because its really awkward for me to tell them these 3 words.&nbsp;
