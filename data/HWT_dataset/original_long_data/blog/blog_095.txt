What's happenin', pandonians? i just checked out the weather for stowe, vt for this weekend since i'm leaving on my big trip tomorrow. Looks like it's going to be a balmy - 26 degrees on sunday without wind chill. Guess that cancels our snowshoeing expedition. Other options: ben & jerry's tour (yay), day-long pub crawl (yay), spa treatments (except for the 'couples massage') (yay), or a one-on-one yahtzee marathon (nay). Valentine's day should be freaky considering i just got the 'goods' from the party i attended a couple weeks ago. But it's a good thing we don't live urllink in texas .
