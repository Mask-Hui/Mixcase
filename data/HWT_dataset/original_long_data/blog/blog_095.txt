What's happenin', Pandonians?  I just checked out the weather for Stowe, VT for this weekend since I'm leaving on my big trip tomorrow.  Looks like it's going to be a balmy  - 26  degrees on Sunday  without  wind chill.  Guess that cancels our snowshoeing expedition.  Other options: Ben & Jerry's tour (yay), Day-Long Pub Crawl (yay), Spa treatments (except for the 'couples massage') (yay), or a one-on-one Yahtzee marathon (nay).  Valentine's day should be  freaky  considering I just got the 'goods' from the party I attended a couple weeks ago.  But it's a good thing we don't live  urlLink in Texas .
