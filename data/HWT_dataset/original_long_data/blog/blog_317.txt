Urllink lets all give a big hello to the newest atom/rdf/rss reader on the block, urllink pulpfiction 1.0 from urllink freshly squeezed software . It looks like it has a lot of native app goodness. It should be noted that it is not free or free, since that seems to be a 'hot topic' on the interweb again. You can try it for 15 days and then go back to something else, or pony up $25 if you like it. A feature that jumps out at me right away is how each post is its own entity, and can be moved around, stored, labeled, and even deleted. I could easily see how this would make some news tracker type people very happy. It imports and exports opml, as you might expect. Of course, the file must have a .opml extension and not .xml. I imported my bloglines subscriptions to get an idea of how it handles what i consider to be a large number of feeds, 109. To be honest, with over 1,500 unread items it seems a bit sluggish on my trusty 500mhz tibook. Overall, if you are in the market for a new news reader, you should certainly give pulp fiction a test drive.
