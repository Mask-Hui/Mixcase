urlLink   Lets all give a big hello to the newest Atom/RDF/RSS reader on the block,  urlLink PulpFiction 1.0  from  urlLink Freshly Squeezed Software .  It looks like it has a lot of native app goodness.  It should be noted that it is not free or Free, since that seems to be a 'hot topic' on the interweb again.  You can try it for 15 days and then go back to something else, or pony up $25 if you like it.  A feature that jumps out at me right away is how each post is its own entity, and can be moved around, stored, labeled, and even deleted.  I could easily see how this would make some news tracker type people very happy.  It imports and exports OPML, as you might expect.  Of course, the file  must  have a .opml extension and not .xml.  I imported my bloglines subscriptions to get an idea of how it handles what I consider to be a large number of feeds, 109.  To be honest, with over 1,500 unread items it seems a bit sluggish on my trusty 500MHz TiBook.  Overall, if you are in the market for a new news reader, you should certainly give Pulp Fiction a test drive.
