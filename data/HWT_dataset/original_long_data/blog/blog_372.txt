Huh, iceland. It kinda makes sense, if you replace cold and forbidding with something else. Not sure what the best words would be... Orchestra: we lost. Okay, we got second place. But we should have got first. And it's bugging me more than i thought it would. I just came expecting to win and have it not really be a big thing, then when we didn't it's like, wtf mate? and they called it runner up, too. It's not second place, it's runner up. It's like saying, 'you were almost the best, but they beat you and you're losers.' but enough about that! afterward it was the best day ever! i left with mowi and celeste, and we went to weird japanese stores with imported candy and stuff. It was awesome! the weirdest stuff ever, it tastes great. I found shrimp flavored chips. Then we went to mowi's uber-awesome house and watched akira. It's freakin weird. Don't ever watch it unless you really want to. Food was great. It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!
