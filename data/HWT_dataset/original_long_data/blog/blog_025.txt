It is going to be a whole weekend of  mini adventures ! I have a little green suitcase full of my worldy goods (vintage dresses, perfume, flyers for  IndieGayClub ) and I am not going home until Sunday. Tonight is Party Night with  FastestViolinInTheWestBoy , to my favouritest club in the world EVER. They play all my favourite tunes and I fall in love with guitar music all over again.  ActorBoyfriend  and I will be chastely sleeping in his bed tonight, then I am going to  PhoneGirl 's BBQ tomorrow afternoon. Then I am going to  LawyerGirl 's excessively nice new Docklands flat for a house warmeing  avec  jacuzzi, then sleeping somewhere then. Finally, I am meeting  TapQueenGirl  for a surprise birthday Sunday lunch for her man... My goodness! What a weekend! &nbsp; I can't drink too much as I want to stay  thin . If I do drink, I'll have to make sure I drink some much I throw it all up again, then the calories don't count. &nbsp; I am so classy it kills me.  &nbsp; See you Monday!
