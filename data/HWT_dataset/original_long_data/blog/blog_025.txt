Wow, nothing much happened today. I woke up...ate some lunch then went with ray and mike to lana's to get the pics she took of the band playing at her party the other night. The pics turned out not that bad besides the 50 million pics of mike..like always lol no no just kidding theres only 4 but neh. Theres 1 pic inparticulat that i like and its of me ray and evan...but u can't see rays face cuz hes standing with his back to the cam. So yea thats wut happened today...not much 'how's your love life' that wut someone asked me earlier today..and so my answer will be posted here. It sucks..thats simple. Thats wut i told them and then they asked..'well..who do u like'? and i told them that theres this one girl that i've been crushing on for a few months now but i dont think it will work out:( but i want it to but sometimes u don't always get wut u want. Meh..i think i'll go now...think about stuff..and her...bye
