It is going to be a whole weekend of mini adventures ! i have a little green suitcase full of my worldy goods (vintage dresses, perfume, flyers for indiegayclub ) and i am not going home until sunday. Tonight is party night with fastestviolininthewestboy , to my favouritest club in the world ever. They play all my favourite tunes and i fall in love with guitar music all over again. Actorboyfriend and i will be chastely sleeping in his bed tonight, then i am going to phonegirl 's bbq tomorrow afternoon. Then i am going to lawyergirl 's excessively nice new docklands flat for a house warmeing avec jacuzzi, then sleeping somewhere then. Finally, i am meeting tapqueengirl for a surprise birthday sunday lunch for her man... My goodness! what a weekend! &nbsp; i can't drink too much as i want to stay thin . If i do drink, i'll have to make sure i drink some much i throw it all up again, then the calories don't count. &nbsp; i am so classy it kills me. &nbsp; see you monday!
