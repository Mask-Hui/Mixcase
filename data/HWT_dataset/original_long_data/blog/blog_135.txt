To the, 'Secrect Admirer' or whatever you want to be called, I honestly didn't check the guestbook till just now. And these are the things I have to say to you....  You are lame for writing something so tactless in my guestbook You are lame for making me have to take time out of my free time to go clean up your mess You are lame for not coming to me personally if you like me so much You are lame for liking me at all You are lame for being scared of telling me who you are You are lame for posting such a thing publically You are lame for writing my name when I CLEARLY censored it in this blog You are lame for being lame  Now, if you want to be mature and come to me and tell me about this, I can tell you in person you are lame.
