Firstly i would like to say i approve of the new american we've got to replace neal. She has offered to challenge him to mortal combat to win our hearts. I'm taking bets, megan nu-ju (max's title) is at $1.03 and neal's blown out to $251. She's from san francisco, the city of sin in the eyes of iowans, and is neal's nemesis in every way. I'm glad that the school has stopped discriminating against personal hygeine by finding a replacement for neal. (no offense neal, but i suspect from your ruddy features and constant heammoroging that you have ebola.) in a related topic, this time in agreeance with neal, i have come to the logical conclusion that the only way we can bring about a world free of discrimination and nuclear weapons is to bomb all the countries with nuclear weapons. I vote that we start with england because it is rainy and i have relatives there who are part of the national front. I think we have to accept that england (like neal) is past its use-by date and for its own sake must be put down. Only then will we achieve our anarcho-syndicalist utopia. Gather your explosives comrades!
