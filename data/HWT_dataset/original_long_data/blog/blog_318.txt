Another dental appointment this afternoon. Today i got my braces removed, at last. Now, i have to wear a retainer instead for another year. Maybe because it's my first time wearing it, i'm still not used to the feeling. It's hard for me to chew and i can't really pronounce some words out properly. Just now, loke and tam came to my house to do our physics group work. However, didn't manage to finish it up and they went home at 10.30. The whole time loke was busy playing with my hamster. Most probably, we'll continue our work tomorrow night.
