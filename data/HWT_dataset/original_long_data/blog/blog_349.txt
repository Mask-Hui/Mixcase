'since I replaced the I in live with an O, I can't remember who you are... ...but tomorrow I'll be you. just pick up the phone.' --Thursday - Tomorrow I'll Be You --      so i woke up this morning around 7:30 and told myself to go back to sleep -- didn't happen. with the sound of light rain on the windows, i look outside to the gray sky and told myself that it's a new day. stumbling down the stairs with the still watery eyes, i remember that i choked again last night. why do i choke??? now, i don't mean that i have an eating problem or anything, i mean that i failed myself.       last night i had the intention of telling this one person my feelings towards her, and i just couldn't -- is that a good or bad sign, i don't know. so now i sit here trying to gather myself before i try again today -- wish me luck .       tomorrow will come, and i know that i've probably failed again, so the cycle begins yet again.
