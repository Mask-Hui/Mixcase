School was pretty normal today, played badminton with staik and at that time, i injured my left ankle again. I don't know why but that part of my leg is increasingly getting weaker, i can't seem to stand balanced on that foot alone. And what's worst, another sprain occurred when the old 1 suffered a week ago hasn't fully recovered. Oh well, i hope to be recover as quickly as possible. I met sumitha later on and we watched <>, quite a decent movie although i wouldn't say the girls were decent, more like bitches in their dressing style. But in the end all turns well, i would rate it 3.4/5, so far no movie has been able to reach 4.0 and higher yet besides pearl harbor, hopefully i would be able to find a movie which will excite me soon. I am considering on joining track and field, i don't know whether i should because sports club is extremely slack, it has been 2 weeks and so far no activities but hopefully there would be some break throughs soon.
