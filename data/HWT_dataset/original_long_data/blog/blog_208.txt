last night,  urlLink Farouche  (or France or LV, so many nicknames) and I went out. met up with lots of rugby boys and Mustang's crowd. partied like rockstars. Cheap drinks flowed like water.   urlLink mexican boy  (aka, Rugby Boy C) was downtown last night, and as soon as i saw him, i was in lust all over again. who needs love when ya got lust? Yum!  Later on that night, ran into  urlLink Jersey Boy (scroll down to Feb 7th) . 'Member him? Talk about lust? We talked for five minutes, me drooling the whole time. so cute. Even though I haven't seen him in two months, he still remembered my (difficult) name. We were going to meet up and party but when it came time to choose between Mexican Boy or Jersey Boy, I called the mexican.  met up with Mexican boy at his house after dropping Farouche off at her place.... he waited for me in his parking lot and started to undress me there. we made out the whole way upstairs to his place. I left his house at 7 am this morning. oops.  i need a nap. i went to sleep at 7 and my office called me at 7:30. so sleepy. but i guess the week in new mexico has made me used to sleeping only a couple of hours a night.  tonight, happy hour at Farouche's. i need to rest up!
