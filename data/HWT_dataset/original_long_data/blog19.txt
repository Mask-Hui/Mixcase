(click the title) (as of august 5th) that's a really interesting site that, instead of viewing polls in terms of the popular vote, breaks them state by state to display them in the way that matters: at the electoral college. According to their projects, kerry is beating bush by 70 votes in the electoral college. As you can see though, most of the states bush has are states that he's holding on to very strongly. He's 'strong' in all of them. I think whats going on is that, by adopting such a conservative agenda, bush is bringing out lots of new voters. Problem is: he's bringing these votes out in the conservative strongholds. He's doing nothing but strengthening and solidifying his base, which can be a good thing for fundraising and campaigning but when it comes to the vote and when it comes to the electoral college, that won't help him. In this country, elections are decided by a select number of swing voters in a select number of states. Those voters don't really care about flip-flopping and all that other mud the bush campaign is throwing kerry's way. Unlike conservative voters, who might come out in droves if there are ammendments and initiatives banning same-sex marriage, bush's increasingly rightist agenda doesn't appeal to them. But that issue still may be a factor since it'll bring out a number of extra conservatives voters who feel really passionately about the issue. Many people seem to neither oppose nor support gay marriage. They just don't care. They'd rather have it but they probably won't come out to the polls to ensure it happens. Many of those who are against it are pretty vehemently against it and will come out to vote. That means more votes for bush. Or maybe i'm just stereotyping and have no idea what i'm talking about. If that's the case, i'll just shut up and direct everyone at this urllink state-by-state breakdown of a much more important issue .
