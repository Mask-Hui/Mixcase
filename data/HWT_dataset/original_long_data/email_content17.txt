Michelle, i hope your week is going well. Please find attached the resume of mitch ludwin. Mitch has great academics (jd '89 cum laude-top 8%, law review, order of the coif, etc.) and extensive transactions experience with an emphasis on finance. Mitch is currently senior associate at troutman sanders in atlanta. Mitch was originally from new york and began his career practicing for three years with cadwalader, wickersham & taft in that city. Mitch then joined mudge, rose, guthrie, alexander y ferdon, spending two years with the firm's new york office, followed by a year and a half with the firm's los angeles office. Upon dissolution of mudge, rose, mitch joined fried, frank, harris, shriver & jacobson in los angeles. Mitch then accepted an opportunity with foley & lardner in milwaukee, where he practiced four years. Mitch joined the firm to participate in the start up of the firm's project finance practice and to be closer to his wife's family. This area of the firm's practice did not develop as anticipated and the attorneys brought in with this expertise moved to other firms. Mitch joined troutman to focus on asset-based lending. I would be happy to provide any additional information concerning mitch which you may wish and to arrange an interview, if you so desire. I anticipate receiving a transactions list, which i will forward to you. I have also submitted mitch's resume to enron energy services for consideration.
