This song kind of came out of all of that. And i wrote a lot of happy songs on my first record, which i still stand by, but this has got something else in it. It's called "peace on earth."♫ there is no hope. ♫♫ there is no future. ♫♫ no faith in god to save the day. ♫♫ there is no reason, no understanding ♫♫ no sacred place to hide away. ♫♫ there is no earnest conversation. ♫♫ no words of wisdom from the wise. ♫♫ there is no reconciliation ♫♫ and no collective compromise. ♫♫ peace on earth, ♫♫ that's what we want. ♫♫ peace on earth, ♫♫ that's what we all say. ♫♫ peace on earth. ♫♫ yet, there in the hallway ♫♫ lurks the ghost of war. ♫♫ he wants more, and more, and more, and more, ♫♫ and more, and more, and more, and more. ♫♫ there is no darkness, no sunshine. ♫♫ there is no great society. ♫♫ there is no freedom without conviction. ♫♫ there is no freedom to be free. ♫♫ there is no heaven, no fire and brimstone. ♫♫ there is no brotherhood of man. ♫♫ there is no country, no one religion. ♫♫ there is no universal plan. ♫♫ peace on earth, ♫♫ that's what we want. ♫♫ peace on earth, ♫♫ that's what we all say. ♫♫ peace on earth. ♫♫ yet, there in the hallway ♫♫ lurks the ghost of war. ♫♫ he wants more, and more, and more, and more, ♫♫ and more, and more, and more, and more, and more. ♫♫ the answer is ♫♫ mutual-assured destruction, ♫♫ a balance of power, ♫♫ a weapon for everyone. ♫♫ mutual-assured destruction ♫♫ bringing peace to everyone. ♫(trumpet sounds)(trumpet sounds)♫ peace on earth, ♫♫ that's what we want. ♫♫ peace on earth, ♫♫ that's what we all say. ♫♫ peace on earth. ♫♫ there in the hallway, ♫♫ peace on earth. ♫♫ peace on earth. ♫♫ peace on earth. ♫(applause)
