Your last paragraph is right on man. It just the commie business practice that bites. Again, my view of the world is that the transmission should be associated with the sink control area - they are the one who takes it home. The source control area shouldn't have the fake transmission. Guess part of the problem is due to cas not registering as tps which would make things much more consistent. Psei will take nor, singlebus, gf (if we're not looking), midc-midc, and other creative entries for the oasis number for midc-midc transactions.
