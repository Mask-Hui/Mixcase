As the title suggests i had a great weekend, i'm just sorry that it had to end. I wont go into all the specifics but i hung out with bunches of friends and family and even saw la plebe play at the phoenix theatre in petaluma. I got to see my friend from the good ol' state of oregon and her twins. I think of the twins, charlotte, is starting to like me but maggie still seems pretty wary of me. I got to see two parades this year, vallejo and benicia's. I think i can say without too much hometown bias that vallejo's was the better of the two, although both shared quite a few floats. I have a feeling that is the reason that benicia has it's parade on the third, because if it did it on the fourth many of it's floats would be in vallejo. Benicia's after parade festivies beat vallejo's handsdown though. In vallejo the vallejo symphony plays after the parade and there is like a mini-crafts fair. In benicia there is literally dancing in the street as a rock band plays various other bands hits. I saw no crafts booths, but there were a few food stands. There is one thing that benicia is missing and that is a ducky durby. I know i bought a duck from a person in vallejo's parade, thought i didn't go to the actual race. Maybe my duck won, that would kick so much ass. I would even love to get fourth place....hmmm, i don't know what happened to my duck ticket though, well they have my name and address. Well, this was a great weekend and i'm glad that i got to spend it with family, old friends, new friends, and people that are just becoming friends. If every weekend were like this life would be grand and almost any lame ass job would be bearable because i would know that i had the weekend and great friends and family to look forward to.
