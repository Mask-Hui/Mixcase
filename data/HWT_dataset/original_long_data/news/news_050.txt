Fletcher has recently graduated from graduated from the university of east anglia creative writing course. Waterstone's fiction writer buyer suzie doore said: "it is great to see susan fletcher win in the first novel category. As a relatively unknown author this award will give her exposure to a wider and mass audience that she may not have reached and is a perfect example of the influence of the whitbread. "fresh out of university she is certainly one to watch." in the biography category it was john guy's the life of mary queen of scots that was picked as winner. The judges called it "an impressive and readable piece of scholarship, which cannot fail but leave the reader moved and intrigued by this most tragic and likeable of queens".
