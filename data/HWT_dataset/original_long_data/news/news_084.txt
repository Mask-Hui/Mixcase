Slowdown hits us factory growth us industrial production increased for the 21st month in a row in february, but at a slower pace than in january, official figures show. The institute for supply management (ism) index fell to 55.3 in february, from an adjusted 56.4 in january. Although the index was lower than in january, the fact that it held above 50 shows continued growth in the sector. "february was another good month in the manufacturing sector," said ism survey chairman norbert ore. "while the overall rate of growth is slowing, the overall picture is improving as price increases and shortages are becoming less of a problem. Exports and imports remain strong," he said. Analysts had expected february's figure to be stronger than january's and come in at 57. Of the 20 manufacturing sectors surveyed by ism, 13 reported growth. They included the textiles, apparel, tobacco, chemicals and transportation sectors. The ism's index of national manufacturing activity is compiled from the responses of purchasing executives at more than 400 industrial companies.
