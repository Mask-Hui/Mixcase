Jowell rejects 'las vegas' jibe the secretary of state for culture, media and sport, tessa jowell, has hit out at critics of the gambling bill. She told the guardian newspaper there would be no "las vegas-style" super-casinos, as rumoured in the press. Meanwhile labour backbencher stephen pound labelled casino-related regeneration schemes "a pile of pants". The mp for ealing north claimed the legislation would encourage a mafia-like culture of vice and corruption, in an interview on bbc radio 4. "you look at some of the people who are involved...they aren't in there to regenerate blackpool. They are in it to fill their boots," mr pound told the today programme. "i just really think that we have made a terrible mistake here. And over all of it hangs the shadow of the men in the chalk-stripe suits with names that rhyme with spaghetti," he said. Ms jowell complained of the "scale of misrepresentation" in the media over the bill in her interview with the newspaper, her first since the bill was launched. The culture secretary said a four year consultation period had produced a consensus on the need to "protect children and the vulnerable" in a swiftly changing sector. Ms jowell insisted: "we have a good track record for extracting planning gain in this country, for instance in social housing." and continued: "we can be proud to have one of the lowest rates of problem gambling in the world. I intend to keep it that way." ms jowell will set out her position when the bill is debated in the commons on monday. In prime minister's questions last week tony blair assured parliament that 90% of the bill was about tightening up the regulation of the gambling industry.
