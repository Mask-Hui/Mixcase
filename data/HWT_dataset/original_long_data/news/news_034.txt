Beer giant swallows russian firm brewing giant inbev has agreed to buy alfa-eco's stake in sun interbrew, russia's second-largest brewer, for up to 259.7m euros ($353.3m; Â£183.75m). Alfa-eco, the venture capital arm of russian conglomerate alfa group, has a one-fifth stake in sun interbrew. The deal gives inbev, the world's biggest beermaker, near-total control over the russian brewer. Inbev bought out another partner in august 2004. Inbev brands include bass, stella artois, hoegaarden and staropramen. It employs 77,000 people, running operations in over 30 countries across the americas, europe and asia pacific. The leuven-based brewery said it would own 97.3% of the voting shares and 98.8% of the non-voting shares of sun interbrew. The deal is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2005. Inbev was formed in august 2004 when belgium's interbrew bought brazilian brewer ambev. Sun interbrew, which employs 8,000 staff, owns breweries in eight russian cities - klin, ivanovo, saransk, kursk, volzhsky, omsk, perm and novocheboksarsk. There are also three breweries in ukraine, in the cities of chernigov, nikolaev and kharkov.
