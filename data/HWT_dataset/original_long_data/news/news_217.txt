Strachan turns down pompey former southampton manager gordon strachan has rejected the chance to become portsmouth's new boss. The scot was pompey chairman milan mandaric's first choice to replace harry redknapp, who left fratton park for rivals saints earlier in december. "i think it's a fantastic job for anybody apart from somebody who has just been the southampton manager," strachan told the bbc. Club director terry brady held initial talks with strachan on saturday. The former scotland international added that joining southampton's local rivals would not be a wise move. "it's got everything going for it but i've got too many memories of the other side and i don't want to sour those memories," he said. "everything's right - it's 10 minutes away, there are good players there, a good set-up, a good atmosphere at the ground. "there's lots to do but it's not right for somebody who has just been the southampton manager." since redknapp's departure, executive director velimir zajec and coach joe jordan have overseen first-team affairs. The duo had gone five matches unbeaten until sunday's 1-0 defeat at home to champions arsenal, but the club are still in a respectable 12th place in the premiership table. Strachan left st mary's in february, after earlier announcing his intention to take a break from the game at the end of the 2003-04 season. His previous managerial experience came at coventry, whom he led for five years from 1996 to 2001.
