I went from CS:GO to this after 1K Hours on CS:GO and I still think this game is gorgeous. I'm really sad that I started to play 1.6 just now, and also that I missed the 1.6 golden era. Even if the physics and almost everything else is really different and 'strange' I find it more relaxing to play but at the same time harder then GO. A lot of players don't even know about this game, but people listen me! If you love CS in general you have to play this game at least once and please don't crack it...you'll find only russians on that versions and everybody knows how they play at CS ;)
