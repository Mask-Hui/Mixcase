There i stood..in that dark cold night...staring right into those eyes who had been watching me as i walked through that dark...endless forest....those eyes that had watched me...that had followed me..all the way through the forest....then i got lost...that's the only reason i saw the eyes on the first place..i felt watched ever since i entered the forest....but i didn't want to look back...so i just went on...but now...i was lost...i got lost and looked all around...but i stopped in the eyes...dark eyes...i could only see some little shine on the...but no color...just shine..and i was freaked...i looked into those eyes..but wasn't scared at all...those eyes seemed to be admiring me...meant no harm...but as i looked at them they drank my essence..i didn't feel anything..i just felt tired...but i wasn't tired...i was just dying...slowly...maybe too slow to notice what was happening...to really know that i wasn't ok..that my life...my essence was taken away from me...because i got lost and looked into those eyes...then i died...after hours of staring...i died...those eyes took all my essence...they took my soul...they took all that made me...well...me...
