These games may seem dated now by comparison with newer graphics, but nothing nowadays compares to the raw energy this game envoked in players. When this game came out, multiplayer was not the co-op centralized thing it is nowadays. This game was the epitomy of multiplayer in the late 90's early 2000's. Every man for himself, run and gun, pit your skills against the others. Many people nver turely got to experience the level of depth that these styles games could evoke. Are you a rocket man, or do you prefer the cool calculated shot of the rail gun. Find out...buy it and play it. There are still severs up with people playing this game to this day...now that is lasting power.
