Observations of thermally driven transverse vibration of a photonic crystal waveguide (pcw) are reported. The pcw consists of two parallel nanobeams with a 240 nm vacuum gap between the beams. Models are developed and validated for the transduction of beam motion to phase and amplitude modulation of a weak optical probe propagating in a guided mode (gm) of the pcw for probe frequencies far from and near to the dielectric band edge. Since our pcw has been designed for near-field atom trapping, this research provides a foundation for evaluating possible deleterious effects of thermal motion on optical atomic traps near the surfaces of pcws. Longer term goals are to achieve strong atom-mediated links between individual phonons of vibration and single photons propagating in the gms of the pcw, thereby enabling opto-mechanics at the quantum level with atoms, photons, and phonons. The experiments and models reported here provide a basis for assessing such goals, including sensing mechanical motion at the standard quantum limit (sql).
