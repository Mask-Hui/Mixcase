Time-series forecasting is important for many applications. Forecasting
models are usually trained using time-series data in a specific target task.
However, sufficient data in the target task might be unavailable, which leads
to performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a few-shot learning
method that forecasts a future value of a time-series in a target task given a
few time-series in the target task. Our model is trained using time-series data
in multiple training tasks that are different from target tasks. Our model uses
a few time-series to build a forecasting function based on a recurrent neural
network with an attention mechanism. With the attention mechanism, we can
retrieve useful patterns in a small number of time-series for the current
situation. Our model is trained by minimizing an expected test error of
forecasting next timestep values. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method using 90 time-series datasets.
