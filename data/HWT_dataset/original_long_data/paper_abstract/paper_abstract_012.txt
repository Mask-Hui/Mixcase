All elementary particles in nature can be classified as fermions with
half-integer spin and bosons with integer spin. Within quantum electrodynamics
(QED), even though the spin of the Dirac particle is well defined, there exist
open questions on the quantized description of spin of the gauge field particle
-- the photon. Here, we discover the quantum operators for the spin angular
momentum (SAM) $\boldsymbol{S}_{M}=(1/c)\int
d^{3}x\boldsymbol{\pi}\times\boldsymbol{A}$ and orbital angular momentum (OAM)
$\boldsymbol{L}_{M}=-(1/c)\int
d^{3}x\pi^{\mu}\boldsymbol{x}\times\boldsymbol{\nabla}A_{\mu}$ of the photon,
where $\pi^{\mu}$ is the conjugate canonical momentum of the gauge field
$A_{\mu}$. Using relativistic field theory, we reveal a perfect symmetry
between the angular momentum commutation relations for Dirac fields and Maxwell
fields. Our work resolves the long-standing questions on the decomposition of
orbital and spin angular momentum of the photon with applications in quantum
optics, topological photonics as well as nanophotonics and also has important
ramifications for the spin structure of nucleons.
