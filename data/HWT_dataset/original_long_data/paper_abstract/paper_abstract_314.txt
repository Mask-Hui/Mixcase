For two convex discs $k$ and $l$, we say that $k$ is $l$-convex if it is equal to the intersection of all translates of $l$ that contain $k$. In $l$-convexity the set $l$ plays a similar role as closed half-spaces do in the classical notion of convexity. We study the following probability model: let $k$ and $l$ be $c^2_+$ smooth convex discs such that $k$ is $l$-convex. Select $n$ i.i.d. Uniform random points $x_1,\ldots, x_n$ from $k$, and consider the intersection $k_{(n)}$ of all translates of $l$ that contain all of $x_1,\ldots, x_n$. The set $k_{(n)}$ is a random $l$-convex polygon in $k$. We study the expectation of the number of vertices $f_0(k_{(n)})$ and the missed area $a(k\setminus k_{n})$ as $n$ tends to infinity. We consider two special cases of the model. In the first case we assume that the maximum of the curvature of the boundary of $l$ is strictly less than $1$ and the minimum of the curvature of $k$ is larger than $1$. In this setting the expected number of vertices and missed area behave in a similar way as in the classical convex case and in the $r$-spindle convex case (when $l$ is a radius $r$ circular disc). The other case we study is when $k=l$. This setting is special in the sense that an interesting phenomenon occurs: the expected number of vertices tends to a finite limit depending only on $l$. This was previously observed in the special case when $l$ is a circle of radius $r$ (fodor, kevei and v\'igh (2014)). We also determine the extrema of the limit of the expectation of the number of vertices of $l_{(n)}$ if $l$ is a convex discs of constant width $1$. The formulas we prove can be considered as generalizations of the corresponding $r$-spindle convex statements proved by fodor, kevei and v\'igh (2014).
