The direpack package aims to establish a set of modern statistical dimension reduction techniques into the python universe as a single, consistent package. The dimension reduction methods included resort into three categories: projection pursuit based dimension reduction, sufficient dimension reduction, and robust m estimators for dimension reduction. As a corollary, regularized regression estimators based on these reduced dimension spaces are provided as well, ranging from classical principal component regression up to sparse partial robust m regression. The package also contains a set of classical and robust pre-processing utilities, including generalized spatial signs, as well as dedicated plotting functionality and cross-validation utilities. Finally, direpack has been written consistent with the scikit-learn api, such that the estimators can flawlessly be included into (statistical and/or machine) learning pipelines in that framework.
