The direpack package aims to establish a set of modern statistical dimension
reduction techniques into the Python universe as a single, consistent package.
The dimension reduction methods included resort into three categories:
projection pursuit based dimension reduction, sufficient dimension reduction,
and robust M estimators for dimension reduction. As a corollary, regularized
regression estimators based on these reduced dimension spaces are provided as
well, ranging from classical principal component regression up to sparse
partial robust M regression. The package also contains a set of classical and
robust pre-processing utilities, including generalized spatial signs, as well
as dedicated plotting functionality and cross-validation utilities. Finally,
direpack has been written consistent with the scikit-learn API, such that the
estimators can flawlessly be included into (statistical and/or machine)
learning pipelines in that framework.
