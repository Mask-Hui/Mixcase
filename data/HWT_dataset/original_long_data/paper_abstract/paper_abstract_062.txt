We present an algorithm for determining the acceleration field of a rigid
body using measurements from four tri-axial accelerometers. The acceleration
field is an important quantity in bio-mechanics problems, especially in the
study of mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI). The in vivo strains in the brain,
which are hypothesized to closely correlate with brain injury, are generally
not directly accessible outside of a laboratory setting. However, they can be
estimated on knowing the head's acceleration field. In contrast to other
techniques, the proposed algorithm uses data exclusively from accelerometers,
rather than from a combination of accelerometers and gyroscopes. For that
reason, the proposed accelerometer only (AO) algorithm does not involve any
numerical differentiation of data, which is known to greatly amplify
measurement noise. For applications where only the magnitude of the
acceleration vector is of interest, the algorithm is straightforward,
computationally efficient and does not require computation of angular velocity
or orientation. When both the magnitude and direction of acceleration are of
interest, the proposed algorithm involves the calculation of the angular
velocity and orientation as intermediate steps. In addition to helping
understand the mechanics of mTBI, the AO-algorithm may find widespread use in
several bio-mechanical applications, gyroscope-free inertial navigation units,
ballistic platform guidance, and platform control.
