We study classical and quantum hidden symmetries of a particle with electric
charge $e$ in the background of a Dirac monopole of magnetic charge $g$
subjected to an additional central potential $V(r)=U(r) +(eg)^2/2mr^{2}$ with
$U(r)=\tfrac{1}{2}m\omega^2r^2$, similar to that in the one-dimensional
conformal mechanics model of de Alfaro, Fubini and Furlan (AFF). By means of a
non-unitary conformal bridge transformation, we establish a relation of the
quantum states and of all symmetries of the system with those of the system
without harmonic trap, $U(r)=0$. Introducing spin degrees of freedom via a very
special spin-orbit coupling, we construct the $\mathfrak{osp}(2,2)$
superconformal extension of the system with unbroken $\mathcal{N}=2$ Poincar\'e
supersymmetry and show that two different superconformal extensions of the
one-dimensional AFF model with unbroken and spontaneously broken supersymmetry
have a common origin. We also show a universal relationship between the
dynamics of a Euclidean particle in an arbitrary central potential $U(r)$ and
the dynamics of a charged particle in a monopole background subjected to the
potential $V(r)$.
