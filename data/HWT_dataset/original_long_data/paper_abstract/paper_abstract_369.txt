The document describes a numerical algorithm for plasms and fluids by the
Lagrange method, in which the spatial meshes follow the plasma and fluid
behavior. Through the mesh wall the plasma and the fluid do not escape. The 3D
Lagrange code is originally designed to simulate a Gold cone plasma, which is
relevant to confine an imploding fuel in the cone in inertial confinement
fusion. However, the 3D Lagrange code would be applied to simulate plasmas and
fluids, which are not deformed seriously. The 3D code is designed in the
spatial Cartesian coordinate (x, y, z), and employs the compressible fluid
model.
