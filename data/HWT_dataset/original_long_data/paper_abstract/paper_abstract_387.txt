This paper presents a millimeter-scale CMOS 64$\times$64 single charged
particle radiation detector system for external beam cancer radiotherapy. A
1$\times$1 $\mu m^2$ diode measures energy deposition by a single charged
particle in the depletion region, and the array design provides a large
detection area of 512$\times$512 $\mu m^2$. Instead of sensing the voltage drop
caused by radiation, the proposed system measures the pulse width, i.e., the
time it takes for the voltage to return to its baseline. This obviates the need
for using power-hungry and large analog-to-digital converters. A prototype ASIC
is fabricated in TSMC 65 nm LP CMOS process and consumes the average static
power of 0.535 mW under 1.2 V analog and digital power supply. The
functionality of the whole system is successfully verified in a clinical 67.5
MeV proton beam setting. To our' knowledge, this is the first work to
demonstrate single charged particle detection for implantable in-vivo
dosimetry.
