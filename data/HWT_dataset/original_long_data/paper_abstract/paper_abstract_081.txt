We present results of a study on identifying circumbinary planet candidates
that produce multiple transits during one conjunction with eclipsing binary
systems. The occurrence of these transits enables us to estimate the
candidates' orbital periods, which is crucial as the periods of the currently
known transiting circumbinary planets are significantly longer than the typical
observational baseline of TESS. Combined with the derived radii, it also
provides valuable information needed for follow-up observations and subsequent
confirmation of a large number of circumbinary planet candidates from TESS.
Motivated by the discovery of the 1108-day circumbinary planet Kepler-1647, we
show the application of this technique to four of Kepler's circumbinary planets
that produce such transits. Our results indicate that in systems where the
circumbinary planet is on a low-eccentricity orbit, the estimated planetary
orbital period is within <10-20% of the true value. This estimate is derived
from photometric observations spanning less than 5% of the planet's period,
demonstrating the strong capability of the technique. Capitalizing on the
current and future eclipsing binaries monitored by NASA's TESS mission, we
estimate that hundreds of circumbinary planets candidates producing multiple
transits during one conjunction will be detected in the TESS data. Such a large
sample will enable statistical understanding of the population of planets
orbiting binary stars and shed new light on their formation and evolution.
