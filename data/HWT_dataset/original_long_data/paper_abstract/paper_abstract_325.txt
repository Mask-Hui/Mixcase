In this paper, we study the landscape of the population negative
log-likelihood function of Gaussian Mixture Models with a general number of
components. Due to nonconvexity, there exist multiple local minima that are not
globally optimal, even when the mixture is well-separated. We show that all
local minima share the same form of structure that partially identifies the
component centers of the true mixture, in the sense that each local minimum
involves a non-overlapping combination of fitting multiple Gaussians to a
single true component and fitting a single Gaussian to multiple true
components. Our results apply to the setting where the true mixture components
satisfy a certain separation condition, and are valid even when the number of
components is over-or under-specified. For Gaussian mixtures with three
components, we obtain sharper results in terms of the scaling with the
separation between the components.
