We formulate the Smoluchowski equation for a run-and-tumble particle. It
includes the mean tumble rate in a chemical field, for which we derive a
Markovian response theory. Using a multipole expansion and a reaction-diffusion
equation for the chemoattractant field, we derive a polarization extended
model, which also includes the recently discovered angle bias. In the adiabatic
limit we recover generalized Keller-Segel equations with diffusion and
chemotactic coefficients that depend on the microscopic swimming parameters. By
requiring the tumble rate to be positive, our model possesses an upper bound of
the chemotactic drift velocity, which is no longer singular as in the original
Keller-Segel equations. Using the Keller-Segel model, we present an extensive
study of traveling bacterial concentration pulses demonstrating how speed,
width, and height of the pulse depend on the microscopic parameters. Most
importantly, we discover a maximum number of bacteria that the pulse can
sustain - the maximum carrying capacity. Finally, we obtain a remarkably good
match to experimental results on the traveling bacterial pulse. It does not
require a second, signaling chemical field nor a singular chemotactic drift
velocity.
