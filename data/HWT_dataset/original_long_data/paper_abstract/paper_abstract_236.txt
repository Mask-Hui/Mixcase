Controlling interfacial interactions in magnetic/topological insulator
heterostructures is a major challenge for the emergence of novel spin-dependent
electronic phenomena. As for any rational design of heterostructures that rely
on proximity effects, one should ideally retain the overall properties of each
component while tuning interactions at the interface. However, in most
inorganic interfaces interactions are too strong, consequently perturbing, and
even quenching, both the magnetic moment and the topological surface states at
each side of the interface. Here we show that these properties can be preserved
by using ligand chemistry to tune the interaction of magnetic ions with the
surface states. By depositing Co-based porphyrin and phthalocyanine monolayers
on the surface of Bi$_2$Te$_3$ thin films, robust interfaces are formed that
preserve undoped topological surface states as well as the pristine magnetic
moment of the divalent Co ions. The selected ligands allow us to tune the
interfacial hybridization within this weak interaction regime. These results,
which are in stark contrast with the observed suppression of the surface state
at the first quintuple layer of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ induced by the interaction with Co
phthalocyanines, demonstrate the capability of planar metal-organic molecules
to span interactions from the strong to the weak limit.
