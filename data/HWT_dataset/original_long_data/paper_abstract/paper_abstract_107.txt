Fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are of great potential to serve as
aerial access points (APs) owing to better aerodynamic performance and longer
flight endurance. However, the inherent hovering feature of fixed-wing UAVs may
result in discontinuity of connections and frequent handover of ground users
(GUs). In this work, we model and evaluate the performance of a fixed-wing UAV
network, where UAV APs provide coverage to GUs with millimeter wave backhaul.
Firstly, it reveals that network spatial throughput (ST) is independent of the
hover radius under real-time closest-UAV association, while linearly decreases
with the hover radius if GUs are associated with the UAVs, whose hover center
is the closest. Secondly, network ST is shown to be greatly degraded with the
over-deployment of UAV APs due to the growing air-to-ground interference under
excessive overlap of UAV cells. Finally, aiming to alleviate the interference,
a projection area equivalence (PAE) rule is designed to tune the UAV beamwidth.
Especially, network ST can be sustainably increased with growing UAV density
and independent of UAV flight altitude if UAV beamwidth inversely grows with
the square of UAV density under PAE.
