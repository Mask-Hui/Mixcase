There is an increasing demand for precise molecular spectroscopy, in
particular in the mid-infrared fingerprint window that hosts a considerable
number of vibrational signatures, whether it be for modeling our atmosphere,
interpreting astrophysical spectra or testing fundamental physics. We present a
high-resolution mid-infrared spectrometer traceable to primary frequency
standards. It combines a widely tunable ultra-narrow Quantum Cascade Laser
(QCL), an optical frequency comb and a compact multipass cell. The QCL
frequency is stabilized onto a comb controlled with a remote near-infrared
ultra-stable laser, transferred through a fiber link. The resulting QCL
frequency stability is below 10-15 from 0.1 to 10s and its frequency
uncertainty of 4x10-14 is given by the remote frequency standards. Continuous
tuning over ~400 MHz is reported. We use the apparatus to perform saturated
absorption spectroscopy of methanol in the low-pressure multipass cell and
demonstrate a statistical uncertainty at the kHz level on transition center
frequencies, confirming its potential for driving the next generation
technology required for precise spectroscopic measurements.
