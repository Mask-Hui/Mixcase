Micro-focus computed tomography (CT), enabling the reconstruction of
hyperfine structure within objects, is a powerful nondestructive testing tool
in many fields. Current X-ray sources for micro-focus CT are typically limited
by their relatively low photon energy and low flux. An all-optical inverse
Compton scattering source (AOCS) based on laser wakefield accelerator (LWFA)
can generate intense quasi-monoenergetic X/gamma-ray pulses in the keV-MeV
range with micron-level source size, and its potential application for
micro-focus CT has become very attractive in recent years due to the fast pace
progress made in LWFA. Here we report the first experimental demonstration of
high-fidelity micro-focus CT using AOCS (~70 keV) by imaging and reconstructing
a test object with complex inner structures. A region-of-interest (ROI) CT
method is adopted to utilize the relatively small field-of-view (FOV) of AOCS
to obtain high-resolution reconstruction. This demonstration of the ROI
micro-focus CT based on AOCS is a key step for its application in the field of
hyperfine nondestructive testing.
