Micro-focus computed tomography (ct), enabling the reconstruction of hyperfine structure within objects, is a powerful nondestructive testing tool in many fields. Current x-ray sources for micro-focus ct are typically limited by their relatively low photon energy and low flux. An all-optical inverse compton scattering source (aocs) based on laser wakefield accelerator (lwfa) can generate intense quasi-monoenergetic x/gamma-ray pulses in the kev-mev range with micron-level source size, and its potential application for micro-focus ct has become very attractive in recent years due to the fast pace progress made in lwfa. Here we report the first experimental demonstration of high-fidelity micro-focus ct using aocs (~70 kev) by imaging and reconstructing a test object with complex inner structures. A region-of-interest (roi) ct method is adopted to utilize the relatively small field-of-view (fov) of aocs to obtain high-resolution reconstruction. This demonstration of the roi micro-focus ct based on aocs is a key step for its application in the field of hyperfine nondestructive testing.
