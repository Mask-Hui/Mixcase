The discovery of a luminous radio burst, FRB 200428, with properties similar
to those of fast radio bursts (FRB), in coincidence with an X-ray flare from
the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154, supports magnetar models for cosmological
FRBs. The burst's X-ray to radio fluence ratio, as well as the X-ray spectral
shape and peak energy, are consistent with FRB 200428 being the result of an
ultra-relativistic shock (powered, e.g., by an ejected plasmoid) propagating
into a magnetized baryon-rich external medium; the shock simultaneously
generates X-ray/gamma-rays via thermal synchrotron emission from electrons
heated behind the shock, and coherent radio emission via the synchrotron maser
mechanism. Here, we point out that a unique consequence of this baryon-loaded
shock scenario is the generation of a coincident burst of high-energy
neutrinos, generated by photo-hadronic interaction of relativistic ions -
heated or accelerated at the shock - with thermal synchrotron photons. We
estimate the properties of these neutrino burst FRB counterparts and find that
a fraction ~1e-8-1e-5 of the flare energy (or ~1e-4-0.1 of the radio isotropic
energy) is channeled into production of neutrinos with typical energies ~
TeV-PeV. We conclude by discussing prospects for detecting this signal with
IceCube and future high-energy neutrino detectors.
