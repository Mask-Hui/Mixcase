The discovery of a luminous radio burst, frb 200428, with properties similar to those of fast radio bursts (frb), in coincidence with an x-ray flare from the galactic magnetar sgr 1935+2154, supports magnetar models for cosmological frbs. The burst's x-ray to radio fluence ratio, as well as the x-ray spectral shape and peak energy, are consistent with frb 200428 being the result of an ultra-relativistic shock (powered, e.g., by an ejected plasmoid) propagating into a magnetized baryon-rich external medium; the shock simultaneously generates x-ray/gamma-rays via thermal synchrotron emission from electrons heated behind the shock, and coherent radio emission via the synchrotron maser mechanism. Here, we point out that a unique consequence of this baryon-loaded shock scenario is the generation of a coincident burst of high-energy neutrinos, generated by photo-hadronic interaction of relativistic ions - heated or accelerated at the shock - with thermal synchrotron photons. We estimate the properties of these neutrino burst frb counterparts and find that a fraction ~1e-8-1e-5 of the flare energy (or ~1e-4-0.1 of the radio isotropic energy) is channeled into production of neutrinos with typical energies ~ tev-pev. We conclude by discussing prospects for detecting this signal with icecube and future high-energy neutrino detectors.
