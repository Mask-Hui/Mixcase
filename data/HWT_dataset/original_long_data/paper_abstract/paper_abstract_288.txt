We investigate operational probabilistic theories where the pure states of
every system are the vertices of a simplex. A special case of such theories is
that of classical theories, i.e. simplicial theories whose pure states are
jointly perfectly discriminable. The usual Classical Theory satisfies also
local discriminability. However, simplicial theories---including the classical
ones---can violate local discriminability, thus admitting of entangled states.
First, we prove sufficient conditions for the presence of entangled states in
arbitrary probabilistic theories. Then, we prove that simplicial theories are
necessarily causal, and this represents a no-go theorem for conceiving
non-causal classical theories. We then provide necessary and sufficient
conditions for simplicial theories to exhibit entanglement, and classify their
system-composition rules. We conclude proving that, in simplicial theories, an
operational formulation of the superposition principle cannot be satisfied, and
that---under the hypothesis of $n$-local discriminability---no mixed state
admits of a purification. Our results hold also in the general case where the
sets of states fail to be convex.
