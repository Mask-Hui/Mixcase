Previous luminescence and absorption experiments in co-doped zno revealed two ionization and one intrashell transition of $d(\textrm{co}^{2+})$ electrons. Those optical properties are analyzed within the generalized gradient approximation to the density functional theory. The two ionization channels involve electron excitations from the two $\textrm{co}^{2+}$ gap states, the $t_{2\uparrow}$ triplet and the $e_{2\downarrow}$ doublet, to the conduction band. The third possible ionization channel, in which an electron is excited from the valence band to the $\textrm{co}^{2+}$ level, requires energy in excess of 4~ev, and cannot lead to absorption below the zno band gap, contrary to earlier suggestions. We also consider two recombination channels, the direct recombination and a two-step process, in which a photoelectron is captured by $\textrm{co}^{3+}$ and then recombines via the internal transition. Finally, the observed increase the band gap with the co concentration is well reproduced by theory. The accurate description of zno:co is achieved after including $+u$ corrections to the relevant orbitals of zn, o, and co. The $+u(\textrm{co})$ value was calculated by the linear response approach, and independently was obtained by fitting the calculated transition energies to the optical data. The respective values, 3.4 and 3.0~ev, agree well. Ionization of co induces large energy shifts of the gap levels, driven by the varying coulomb coupling between the $d(\textrm{co})$ electrons, and by large lattice relaxations around co ions. In turn, over $\sim 1$~ev changes of $\textrm{co}^{2+}$ levels induced by the internal transition are mainly caused by the occupation-dependent $u(\textrm{co})$ corrections.
