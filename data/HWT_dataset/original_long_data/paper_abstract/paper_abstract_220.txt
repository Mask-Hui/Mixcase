Open-system dynamics play a key role in the experimental and theoretical
study of cavity optomechanical systems. In many cases, the quantum Langevin
equations have enabled excellent models for optical decoherence, yet a master
equation approach for the fully nonlinear optomechanical Hamiltonian has thus
far proven more elusive. To address this outstanding question and broaden the
mathematical toolset available, we derive a solution to the Lindblad master
equation that models optical decoherence for a system evolving with the
nonlinear optomechanical Hamiltonian. The method combines a Lie-algebra
solution to the unitary dynamics with a vectorization of the Lindblad equation,
and we demonstrate its applicability by considering the preparation of optical
cat-states via the optomechanical nonlinearity in the presence of optical loss.
Our results provide a direct way of analytically assessing the impact of
optical decoherence on the optomechanical intracavity state.
