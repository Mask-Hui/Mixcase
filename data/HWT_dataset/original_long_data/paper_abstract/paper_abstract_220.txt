Open-system dynamics play a key role in the experimental and theoretical study of cavity optomechanical systems. In many cases, the quantum langevin equations have enabled excellent models for optical decoherence, yet a master equation approach for the fully nonlinear optomechanical hamiltonian has thus far proven more elusive. To address this outstanding question and broaden the mathematical toolset available, we derive a solution to the lindblad master equation that models optical decoherence for a system evolving with the nonlinear optomechanical hamiltonian. The method combines a lie-algebra solution to the unitary dynamics with a vectorization of the lindblad equation, and we demonstrate its applicability by considering the preparation of optical cat-states via the optomechanical nonlinearity in the presence of optical loss. Our results provide a direct way of analytically assessing the impact of optical decoherence on the optomechanical intracavity state.
