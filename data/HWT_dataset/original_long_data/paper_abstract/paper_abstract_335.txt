Recently the LHCb collaboration has confirmed the evidence for lepton flavour
non-universality at the $3.1\sigma$ level via an updated measurement of $R_K$.
In this work we analyse this evidence within a model-independent approach. We
make projections for future measurements which indicate that LHCb will be in
the position to discover lepton nonuniversality with the Run 3 data in a single
observable. We analyse other ratios based on our analysis of the present
measurements of the ratios $R_{K^{(*)}}$ and analyse if they are able to
differentiate between various new physics options within the effective field
theory at present or in the near future. We also compare the present deviations
in the ratios with NP indications in the angular observables of exclusive $b
\to s \ell\ell$ transitions. Finally, we update our global analysis considering
all $b \to s \ell\ell$ observables altogether, including a 20-parameter fit in
connection of a Wilks' test.
