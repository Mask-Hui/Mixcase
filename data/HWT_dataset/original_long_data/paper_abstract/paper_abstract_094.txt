Pascal's Theorem gives a synthetic geometric condition for six points
$a,\ldots,f$ in $\mathbb{P}^2$ to lie on a conic. Namely, that the intersection
points $\overline{ab}\cap\overline{de}$, $\overline{af}\cap\overline{dc}$,
$\overline{ef}\cap\overline{bc}$ are aligned. One could ask an analogous
question in higher dimension: is there a coordinate-free condition for $d+4$
points in $\mathbb{P}^d$ to lie on a degree $d$ rational normal curve? In this
paper we find many of these conditions by writing in the Grassmann-Cayley
algebra the defining equations of the parameter space of $d+4$ ordered points
in $\mathbb{P}^d$ that lie on a rational normal curve. These equations were
introduced and studied in a previous joint work of the authors with
Giansiracusa and Moon. We conclude with an application in the case of seven
points on a twisted cubic.
