The dark matter, needed for various phenomena ranging from flat rotation
curves to structure formation, seems to be not only neutral and long-living but
also highly secluded from the ordinary matter. Here we show that, metric-affine
gravity, which involves metric tensor and affine connection as two independent
fields, dynamically reduces, in its minimal form, to the usual gravity plus a
massive vector field. The vector, which interacts with only the quarks, leptons
and gravity, is neutral and long-living (longer than the age of the Universe)
when its mass range is $9.4\ {\rm MeV} < M_Y < 28.4\ {\rm MeV}$. Its scattering
cross section from nucleons, which is some 60 orders of magnitude below the
current bounds, is too small to facilitate direct detection of the dark matter.
This property provides an explanation for whys and hows of dark matter
searches. We show that due to its geometrical origin the $Y_\mu$ does not
couple to scalars and gauge bosons. It couples only to fermions. This very
feature of the $Y_\mu$ makes it fundamentally different than all the other
vector dark matter candidates in the literature. The geometrical dark matter we
present is minimal and self-consistent not only theoretically but also
astrophysically in that its feebly interacting nature is all that is needed for
its longevity.
