The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox is one of the milestones in quantum
foundations, arising from the lack of local realistic description of quantum
mechanics. The EPR paradox has stimulated an important concept of "quantum
nonlocality", which manifests itself by three different types: quantum
entanglement, quantum steering, and Bell nonlocality. Although Bell nonlocality
is more often used to show the "quantum nonlocality", the original EPR paradox
is essentially a steering paradox. In this work, we formulate the original EPR
steering paradox into a contradiction equality,thus making it amenable to an
experimental verification. We perform an experimental test of the steering
paradox in a two-qubit scenario. Furthermore, by starting from the steering
paradox, we generate a generalized linear steering inequality and transform
this inequality into a mathematically equivalent form, which is more friendly
for experimental implementation, i.e., one may only measure the observables in
$x$-, $y$-, or $z$-axis of the Bloch sphere, rather than other arbitrary
directions. We also perform experiments to demonstrate this scheme. Within the
experimental errors, the experimental results coincide with the theoretical
predictions. Our results deepen the understanding of quantum foundations and
provide an efficient way to detect the steerability of quantum states.
