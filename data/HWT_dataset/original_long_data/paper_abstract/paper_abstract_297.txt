We study asymptotic state transformations in continuous variable quantum
resource theories. In particular, we prove that monotones displaying lower
semicontinuity and strong superadditivity can be used to bound asymptotic
transformation rates in these settings. This removes the need for asymptotic
continuity, which cannot be defined in the traditional sense for
infinite-dimensional systems. We consider three applications, to the resource
theories of (I) optical nonclassicality, (II) entanglement, and (III) quantum
thermodynamics. In cases (II) and (III), the employed monotones are the
(infinite-dimensional) squashed entanglement and the free energy, respectively.
For case (I), we consider the measured relative entropy of nonclassicality and
prove it to be lower semicontinuous and strongly superadditive. Our technique
then yields computable upper bounds on asymptotic transformation rates
including those achievable under linear optical elements. We also prove a
number of results which ensure the measured relative entropy of nonclassicality
to be bounded on any physically meaningful state, and to be easily computable
for some class of states of interest, e.g., Fock diagonal states. We conclude
by applying our findings to the problem of cat state manipulation and noisy
Fock state purification.
