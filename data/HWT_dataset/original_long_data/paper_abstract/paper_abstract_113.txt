We identify a class of dressed atom-photon states formingat the same energy of the atom at any coupling strength. As a hallmark, their photonic component is an eigenstate of the bare photonic bath with a vacancy in place of the atom. The picture accommodates waveguide-qed phenomena where atoms behave as perfect mirrors, connecting in particular dressed bound states (bs) in the continuum or bic with geometrically-confined photonic modes. When applied to photonic lattices, the framework provides a general criterion to predict dressed bs in lattices with topological properties by putting them in one-to-one correspondence with photonic bs. New classes of dressed bs are thus predicted in the photonic creutz-ladder and haldane models. In the latter case, states with non-zero local photon flux occur, where an atom is dressed by a photon orbiting around it.
