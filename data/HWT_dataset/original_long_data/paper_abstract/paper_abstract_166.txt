Routing controllability of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has been shown to reduce
the impact of selfish routing on network efficiency. However, the assumption
that AVs would readily allow themselves to be controlled externally by a
central agency is unrealistic. In this paper, we propose a joint routing and
pricing control scheme that aims to incentivize AVs to seek centrally
controlled system optimal (SO) routing by saving on tolls while user
equilibrium (UE) seeking AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs) are subject to a
congestion charge. The problem is formulated as a bi-level optimization, in
which dynamic tolls are optimized in the upper level, whereas the lower level
is a mixed equilibrium simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment model
considering mixed fleet of AVs and HVs. We develop a feedback-based controller
to implement a second-based pricing scheme from which SO-seeking AVs are
exempt; but UEseeking vehicles, including both AVs and HVs, are subject to a
distance-based charge for entering a pricing zone. This control strategy
encourages controllable AVs to adopt SO routing while discouraging UE-seeking
users from entering the pricing zone. We demonstrate the performance of the
proposed framework using the Nguyen network and a large-scale network model of
Melbourne, Australia.
