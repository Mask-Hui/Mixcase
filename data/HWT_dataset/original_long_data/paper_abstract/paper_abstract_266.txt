We report a combined theoretical and experimental investigation of half-metallic ferromagnetism in equiatomic quaternary heusler alloy corumnsi. Room temperature xrd analysis reveals that the alloy crystallizes in l21 disorder instead of pristine y-type structure due to 50% swap disorder between the tetrahedral sites, i.e., co and ru atoms. Magnetization measurements reveal a net magnetization of 4 $\mu_b$ with curie temperature of ~780 k. Resistivity measurement reveals the presence of localization effect below 35 k while above 100 k, a linear dependence is observed. Resistivity behavior indicates the absence of single magnon scattering, which indirectly supports the half-metallic nature. The majority spin band near the fermi level clearly indicates the overlap of flat eg bands with sharply varying conduction bands that are responsible for the localization. In-depth analysis of the projected atomic d-orbital character of band structure reveals unusual bonding, giving rise to the flat eg bands purely arising out of ru ions. Co-ru swap disorder calculations indicate the robustness of half-metallic nature, even when the structure changes from y-type to l21-type, with no major change in the net magnetization of the system. Thus, robust half-metallic nature, stable structure, and high curie temperature make this alloy quite a promising candidate to be used as a source of highly spin-polarized currents in spintronic applications.
