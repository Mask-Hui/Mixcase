We have implemented a GPU version of the Jefimenko's equations -- JefiGPU.
Given the proper distributions of the source terms $\rho$ (charge density) and
$\mathbf{J}$ (current density) in the source volume, the algorithm gives the
electromagnetic fields in the observational region (not necessarily overlaps
the vicinity of the sources). To verify the accuracy of the GPU implementation,
we have compared the obtained results with that of the theoretical ones. Our
results show that the deviations of the GPU results from the theoretical ones
are around 5\%. Meanwhile, we have also compared the performance of the GPU
implementation with a CPU version. The simulation results indicate that the GPU
code is significantly faster than the CPU version. Finally, we have studied the
parameter dependence of the execution time and memory consumption on one NVIDIA
Tesla V100 card. Our code can be consistently coupled to RBG (Relativistic
Boltzmann equations on GPUs) and many other GPU-based algorithms in physics.
