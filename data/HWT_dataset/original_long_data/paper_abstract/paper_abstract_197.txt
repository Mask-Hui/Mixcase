In any natural science, measurements are the essential link between theory
and observable reality. Is it possible to obtain accurate and relevant
information via measurement whose action on the probed system is unknown? In
other words, can one be convinced to know something about the nature without
knowing in detail how the information was obtained? In this paper, we show that
the answer is surprisingly, yes. We construct and experimentally implement a
quantum optical probing measurement where measurements on the probes, the
photons' polarization states, are used to extract information on the systems,
the frequency spectra of the same photons. Unlike the pre-existing probing
protocols, our measurement does not require any knowledge of the interaction
between the probe and the system.
