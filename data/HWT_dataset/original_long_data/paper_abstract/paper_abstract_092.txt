The tree-level partonic angular distribution of standard model $w\gamma$ production possesses a feature known as the radiation amplitude zero (raz) where destructive interference causes the cross section to vanish. At the proton level the exact cancellation disappears, however, one can find a dip in the central region of the angular distributions, here called the radiation valley (rv). In this paper, we show how the sensitivity for $w(\ell\nu)\gamma$ resonances can be significantly improved if one focuses on events in the rv region. Using this technique, we find that the lhc could probe a larger range of resonance masses, equivalent to increasing the luminosity by a factor of $2-3$ over conventional searches. The exact increase depends on the spin of the $w\gamma$ resonance and exactly how it couples to electroweak gauge bosons.
