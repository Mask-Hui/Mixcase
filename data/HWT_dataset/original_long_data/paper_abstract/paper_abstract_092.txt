The tree-level partonic angular distribution of Standard Model $W\gamma$
production possesses a feature known as the Radiation Amplitude Zero (RAZ)
where destructive interference causes the cross section to vanish. At the
proton level the exact cancellation disappears, however, one can find a dip in
the central region of the angular distributions, here called the Radiation
Valley (RV). In this paper, we show how the sensitivity for $W(\ell\nu)\gamma$
resonances can be significantly improved if one focuses on events in the RV
region. Using this technique, we find that the LHC could probe a larger range
of resonance masses, equivalent to increasing the luminosity by a factor of
$2-3$ over conventional searches. The exact increase depends on the spin of the
$W\gamma$ resonance and exactly how it couples to electroweak gauge bosons.
