In this paper, we calculate the matrix element and form factors of
vector-to-vector ($V'\to V'$) transition within the standard light-front~(SLF)
and covariant light-front~(CLF) quark models~(QMs), and investigate the
self-consistency and Lorentz covariance of the CLF QM within two types of
correspondences between the manifest covariant Bethe-Salpeter approach and the
LF approach. The zero-mode and valence contributions to the form factors of
$V'\to V'$ transition in the CLF QM and their relation to the SLF results are
analyzed, and the main conclusions obtained via the decay constants of vector
and axial-vector mesons and form factors of $P\to V$ transition in the previous
works are confirmed again. Furthermore, we present our numerical predictions
for the form factors of $c\to (q,s)$ ($q=u,d$) induced $D^*\to (K^*\,,\rho)$,
$D^*_s\to (\phi\,,K^*)$, $J/\Psi\to (D^*_s\,,D^*)$, $B^*_c\to (B^*_s\,,B^*)$
transitions and $b\to (q,s,c)$ induced $B^*\to (D^*\,,K^*\,,\rho)$, $B^*_s\to
(D^*_s\,,\phi\,,K^*)$, $B^*_c\to (J/\Psi\,,D^*_s\,,D^*)$, $\Upsilon(1S)\to
(B_c^*\,,B_s^*\,,B^*)$ transitions, which can be applied further to the
relevant phenomenological studies of meson decays.
