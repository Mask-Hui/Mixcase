In this paper, we calculate the matrix element and form factors of vector-to-vector ($v'\to v'$) transition within the standard light-front~(slf) and covariant light-front~(clf) quark models~(qms), and investigate the self-consistency and lorentz covariance of the clf qm within two types of correspondences between the manifest covariant bethe-salpeter approach and the lf approach. The zero-mode and valence contributions to the form factors of $v'\to v'$ transition in the clf qm and their relation to the slf results are analyzed, and the main conclusions obtained via the decay constants of vector and axial-vector mesons and form factors of $p\to v$ transition in the previous works are confirmed again. Furthermore, we present our numerical predictions for the form factors of $c\to (q,s)$ ($q=u,d$) induced $d^*\to (k^*\,,\rho)$, $d^*_s\to (\phi\,,k^*)$, $j/\psi\to (d^*_s\,,d^*)$, $b^*_c\to (b^*_s\,,b^*)$ transitions and $b\to (q,s,c)$ induced $b^*\to (d^*\,,k^*\,,\rho)$, $b^*_s\to (d^*_s\,,\phi\,,k^*)$, $b^*_c\to (j/\psi\,,d^*_s\,,d^*)$, $\upsilon(1s)\to (b_c^*\,,b_s^*\,,b^*)$ transitions, which can be applied further to the relevant phenomenological studies of meson decays.
