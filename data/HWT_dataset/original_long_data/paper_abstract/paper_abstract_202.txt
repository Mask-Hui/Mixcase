The greedy spanner is arguably the simplest and most well-studied spanner construction. Experimental results demonstrate that it is at least as good as any other spanner construction, in terms of both the size and weight parameters. However, a rigorous proof for this statement has remained elusive. In this work we fill in the theoretical gap via a surprisingly simple observation: the greedy spanner is \emph{existentially optimal} (or existentially near-optimal) for several important graph families, in terms of both the size and weight. Roughly speaking, the greedy spanner is said to be existentially optimal (or near-optimal) for a graph family $\mathcal g$ if the worst performance of the greedy spanner over all graphs in $\mathcal g$ is just as good (or nearly as good) as the worst performance of an optimal spanner over all graphs in $\mathcal g$. Focusing on the weight parameter, the state-of-the-art spanner constructions for both general graphs (due to chechik and wulff-nilsen [soda'16]) and doubling metrics (due to gottlieb [focs'15]) are complex. Plugging our observation on these results, we conclude that the greedy spanner achieves near-optimal weight guarantees for both general graphs and doubling metrics, thus resolving two longstanding conjectures in the area. Further, we observe that approximate-greedy spanners are existentially near-optimal as well. Consequently, we provide an $o(n \log n)$-time construction of $(1+\epsilon)$-spanners for doubling metrics with constant lightness and degree. Our construction improves gottlieb's construction, whose runtime is $o(n \log^2 n)$ and whose number of edges and degree are unbounded, and remarkably, it matches the state-of-the-art euclidean result (due to gudmundsson et al.\ [sicomp'02]) in all the involved parameters (up to dependencies on $\epsilon$ and the dimension).
