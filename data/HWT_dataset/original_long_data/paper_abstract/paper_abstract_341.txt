The Mittag-Leffler function is universally acclaimed as the Queen function of
fractional calculus. The aim of this work is to survey the key results and
applications emerging from the three-parameter generalization of this function,
known as the Prabhakar function. Specifically, after reviewing key historical
events that led to the discovery and modern development of this peculiar
function, we discuss how the latter allows one to introduce an enhanced scheme
for fractional calculus. Then, we summarize the progress in the application of
this new general framework to physics and renewal processes. We also provide a
collection of results on the numerical evaluation of the Prabhakar function.
