We study whether a given graph can be realized as an adjacency graph of the polygonal cells of a polyhedral surface in $\mathbb{r}^3$. We show that every graph is realizable as a polyhedral surface with arbitrary polygonal cells, and that this is not true if we require the cells to be convex. In particular, if the given graph contains $k_5$, $k_{5,81}$, or any nonplanar $3$-tree as a subgraph, no such realization exists. On the other hand, all planar graphs, $k_{4,4}$, and $k_{3,5}$ can be realized with convex cells. The same holds for any subdivision of any graph where each edge is subdivided at least once, and, by a result from mcmullen et al. (1983), for any hypercube. Our results have implications on the maximum density of graphs describing polyhedral surfaces with convex cells: the realizability of hypercubes shows that the maximum number of edges over all realizable $n$-vertex graphs is in $\omega(n \log n)$. From the non-realizability of $k_{5,81}$, we obtain that any realizable $n$-vertex graph has $o(n^{9/5})$ edges. As such, these graphs can be considerably denser than planar graphs, but not arbitrarily dense.
