We study whether a given graph can be realized as an adjacency graph of the
polygonal cells of a polyhedral surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We show that every
graph is realizable as a polyhedral surface with arbitrary polygonal cells, and
that this is not true if we require the cells to be convex. In particular, if
the given graph contains $K_5$, $K_{5,81}$, or any nonplanar $3$-tree as a
subgraph, no such realization exists. On the other hand, all planar graphs,
$K_{4,4}$, and $K_{3,5}$ can be realized with convex cells. The same holds for
any subdivision of any graph where each edge is subdivided at least once, and,
by a result from McMullen et al. (1983), for any hypercube.
  Our results have implications on the maximum density of graphs describing
polyhedral surfaces with convex cells: The realizability of hypercubes shows
that the maximum number of edges over all realizable $n$-vertex graphs is in
$\Omega(n \log n)$. From the non-realizability of $K_{5,81}$, we obtain that
any realizable $n$-vertex graph has $O(n^{9/5})$ edges. As such, these graphs
can be considerably denser than planar graphs, but not arbitrarily dense.
