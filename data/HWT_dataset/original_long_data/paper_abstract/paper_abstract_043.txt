What is the dimension of spacetime? we address this question in the context of the ads/cft correspondence. We give a prescription for computing the number of large bulk dimensions, $d$, from strongly-coupled cft$_d$ data, where "large" means parametrically of order the ads scale. The idea is that unitarity of 1-loop ads amplitudes, dual to non-planar cft correlators, fixes $d$ in terms of tree-level data. We make this observation rigorous by deriving a positive-definite sum rule for the 1-loop double-discontinuity in the flat space/bulk-point limit. This enables us to prove an array of ads/cft folklore, and to infer new properties of large $n$ cfts at strong coupling that ensure consistency of emergent large extra dimensions with string/m-theory. We discover an ope universality at the string scale: to leading order in large $n$, heavy-heavy-light three-point functions, with heavy operators that are parametrically lighter than a power of $n$, are linear in the heavy conformal dimension. We explore its consequences for supersymmetric cfts and explain how emergent large extra dimensions relate to a sublattice weak gravity conjecture for cfts. Lastly, we conjecture, building on a claim of arxiv:0908.0756, that any cft with large higher-spin gap and no global symmetries has a holographic hierarchy: $d=d+1$
