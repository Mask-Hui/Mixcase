We propose a Monte Carlo algorithm to sample from high dimensional
probability distributions that combines Markov chain Monte Carlo and importance
sampling. We provide a careful theoretical analysis, including guarantees on
robustness to high dimensionality, explicit comparison with standard Markov
chain Monte Carlo methods and illustrations of the potential improvements in
efficiency. Simple and concrete intuition is provided for when the novel scheme
is expected to outperform standard schemes. When applied to Bayesian
variable-selection problems, the novel algorithm is orders of magnitude more
efficient than available alternative sampling schemes and enables fast and
reliable fully Bayesian inferences with tens of thousand regressors.
