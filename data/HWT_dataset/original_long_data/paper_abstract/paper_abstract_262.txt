Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations have been intensively used for
solving discrete quadratic optimization problems, in particular in the binary
case. For the general non-convex integer case with box constraints, the
branch-and-bound algorithm Q-MIST has been proposed by Buchheim and Wiegele
(Math Program 141(1--2):435--452, 2013), which is based on an extension of the
well-known SDP-relaxation for max-cut. For solving the resulting SDPs, Q-MIST
uses an off-the-shelf interior point algorithm.
  In this paper, we present a tailored coordinate ascent algorithm for solving
the dual problems of these SDPs. Building on related ideas of Dong (SIAM J
Optim 26(3):1962--1985, 2016), it exploits the particular structure of the
SDPs, most importantly a small rank of the constraint matrices. The latter
allows both an exact line search and a fast incremental update of the inverse
matrices involved, so that the entire algorithm can be implemented to run in
quadratic time per iteration. Moreover, we describe how to extend this approach
to a certain two-dimensional coordinate update. Finally, we explain how to
include arbitrary linear constraints into this framework, and evaluate our
algorithm experimentally.
