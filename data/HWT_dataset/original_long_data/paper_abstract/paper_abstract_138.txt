We observe a novel type of shear banding in the rheology of thixotropic yield-stress fluids that is due to the coupling of both non-locality and thixotropy. The latter is known to lead to shear banding even in homogeneous stress fields, but the bands observed in the presence of non-local effects appear different as the shear rate varies continuously over the shear band. Here, we introduce a simple non-local model for the shear banding (nl-sb), and we implement it for the analysis of micron-scale rheo-mri velocimetry measurements of a milk microgel suspension in a cone-and-plate geometry. The proposed nl-sb model accurately quantifies the cooperativity length and yields values in the order of the aggregate size in the microgel.
