We discuss spontaneous symmetry breaking of open classical and quantum systems. When a continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken in an open system, a gapless excitation mode appears corresponding to the nambu-goldstone mode. Unlike isolated systems, the gapless mode is not always a propagation mode, but it is a diffusion one. Using the ward-takahashi identity and the effective action formalism, we establish the nambu-goldstone theorem in open systems, and derive the low-energy coefficients that determine the dispersion relation of nambu-goldstone modes. Using these coefficients, we classify the nambu-goldstone modes into four types: type-a propagation, type-a diffusion, type-b propagation, and type-b diffusion modes.
