In this paper I report, exchange bias effect in a bilayer thin film of
amorphous zinc ferrite and nanocrystalline gallium ferrite. The amorphous zinc
ferrite layer was deposited at room temperature (Ts = RT) on top of a
nanocrystalline gallium ferrite thin film using a pulsed laser. This bilayer
film showed large exchange bias effect (He ~ 418 Oe at 2 K). The exchange bias
shift decreased exponentially as the temperature increased and disappeared for
T > 30 K. Along with the exchange bias shift the film also showed enhanced
magnetization in Field Cooled (FC) measurements as compared to the Zero Field
Cooled (ZFC) magnetization. The bilayer film also showed training effect at 2
K, which followed spin configurational relaxation model. The observed exchange
bias effect could be attributed to the pinning anisotropy of the spin glass
amorphous zinc ferrite layer pinned at the interface of gallium ferrite.
