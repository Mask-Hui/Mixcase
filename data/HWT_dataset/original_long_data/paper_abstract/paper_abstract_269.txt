Negative refraction usually demands complex structure engineering while it is
very natural for massless Dirac fermions (MDFs) across the \textit{p-n}
junction, this leads to Dirac electron optics. The emergent Dirac materials may
exhibit hitherto unidentified phenomenon due to their nontrivial band
structures in contrast to the isotropic MDFs in graphene. Here, as a specific
example, we explore the negative refraction induced caustics and Veselago
focusing of tilted MDFs across 8-\textit{Pmmn} borophene \textit{p-n}
junctions. To this aim, we develop a technique to effectively construct the
electronic Green's function in \textit{p-n} junctions with arbitrary junction
directions. Based on analytical discussions and numerical calculations, we
demonstrate the strong dependence of interference pattern on the junction
direction. As the junction direction perpendicular to the tilt direction,
Veselago focusing or normal caustics (similar to that in graphene) appears
resting on the doping configuration of the \textit{p-n} junctions, otherwise
anomalous caustics (different from that in graphene) occurs which is
manipulated by the junction direction and the doping configuration. Finally,
the developed Green's function technique is generally promising to uncover the
unique transport of emergent MDFs, and the discovered anomalous caustics makes
tilted MDFs potential applications in Dirac electron optics.
