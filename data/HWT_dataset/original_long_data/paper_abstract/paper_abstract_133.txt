Quantum Fisher information (QFI) and skew information (SI) plays a key role
in the quantum resource theory. Understanding these measures in the physical
system has practical significance in the state parameter estimation and quantum
metrology. In this article, we consider a pair ofspin-1/2 particles coupled
with dipolar and Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) interactions, serving as the
physical carrier of quantum information. We examine the bipartite nonlocal
correlations of pair of spin-1/2 particle system for the thermal equilibrium
states, characterized by local quantum uncertainty (LQU) and local quantum
Fisher information (lQFI). The effects of dipolar coupling constants on quantum
correlation quantifiers are studied. The DM interaction greatly enhances the
quantum correlation in the system whereas the temperature tends to annihilate
the amount of quantum correlations.
