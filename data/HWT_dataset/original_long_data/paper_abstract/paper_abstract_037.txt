We propose an experimental time-of-flight test of the photon "trajectory" predictions of the bohmian version of quantum mechanics. The photon trajectories in free space, as predicted by bohmian mechanics, deviate from expected straight-line paths, bending and turning corners in the presence of quantum interference. We propose an experiment using two such corner-turns that should, in principle, allow these hypothetical bohmian photons to arrive at a timing detector earlier than conventional photons traveling on the straight-line paths predicted by standard quantum mechanics.
