We propose an experimental time-of-flight test of the photon "trajectory"
predictions of the Bohmian version of quantum mechanics. The photon
trajectories in free space, as predicted by Bohmian mechanics, deviate from
expected straight-line paths, bending and turning corners in the presence of
quantum interference. We propose an experiment using two such corner-turns that
should, in principle, allow these hypothetical Bohmian photons to arrive at a
timing detector earlier than conventional photons traveling on the
straight-line paths predicted by standard quantum mechanics.
