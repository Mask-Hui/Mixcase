Spintronic nanodevices have ultrafast nonlinear dynamic and recurrence
behaviors on a nanosecond scale that promises to enable spintronic reservoir
computing (RC) system. Here two physical RC systems based on a single magnetic
skyrmion memristor (MSM) and 24 spin-torque nano-oscillators (STNOs) were
proposed and modeled to process image classification task and nonlinear dynamic
system prediction, respectively. Based on our micromagnetic simulation results
on the nonlinear responses of MSM and STNO with current pulses stimulation, the
handwritten digits recognition task domesticates that an RC system using one
single MSM has the outstanding performance on image classification. In
addition, the complex unknown nonlinear dynamic problems can also be well
solved by a physical RC system consisted of 24 STNOs confirmed in a
second-order nonlinear dynamic system and NARMA10 tasks. The capability of both
high accuracy and fast information processing promises to enable one type of
brain-like chip based on spintronics for various artificial intelligence tasks.
