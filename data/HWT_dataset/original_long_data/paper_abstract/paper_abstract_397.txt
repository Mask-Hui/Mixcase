Within General Relativity, the unique stationary solution of an isolated
black hole is the Kerr spacetime, which has a peculiar multipolar structure
depending only on its mass and spin. We develop a general method to extract the
multipole moments of arbitrary stationary spacetimes and apply it to a large
family of horizonless microstate geometries. The latter can break the axial and
equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric and have a much richer multipolar
structure, which provides a portal to constrain fuzzball models
phenomenologically. We find numerical evidence that all multipole moments are
typically larger (in absolute value) than those of a Kerr black hole with the
same mass and spin. Current measurements of the quadrupole moment of black-hole
candidates could place only mild constraints on fuzzballs, while future
gravitational-wave detections of extreme mass-ratio inspirals with the space
mission LISA will improve these bounds by orders of magnitude.
