The perturbation method is an approximation scheme with a solvable
leading-order. The standard way is to choose a non-interacting sector for the
leading order. The adaptive perturbation method improves the solvable part in
bosonic systems by using all diagonal elements of the Fock state. We consider
the harmonic oscillator with the interacting term,
$\lambda_1x^4/6+\lambda_2x^6/120$, where $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are
coupling constants, and $x$ is the position operator. The spectrum shows a
quantitative result, less than 1 percent error, compared to a numerical
solution when we use the adaptive perturbation method up to the second-order
and turn off the $\lambda_2$. When we turn on the $\lambda_2$, the deviation
becomes larger, but the error is still less than 2 percent error. Our
qualitative results are demonstrated in different values of coupling constants,
not only focused on a weakly coupled region.
