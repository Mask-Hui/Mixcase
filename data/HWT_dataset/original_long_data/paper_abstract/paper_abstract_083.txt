In this work, we present a new operator, called instance mask projection (imp), which projects a predicted instance segmentation as a new feature for semantic segmentation. It also supports back propagation so is trainable end-to-end. Our experiments show the effectiveness of imp on both clothing parsing (with complex layering, large deformations, and non-convex objects), and on street scene segmentation (with many overlapping instances and small objects). On the varied clothing parsing dataset (vcp), we show instance mask projection can improve 3 points on miou from a state-of-the-art panoptic fpn segmentation approach. On the modanet clothing parsing dataset, we show a dramatic improvement of 20.4% absolutely compared to existing baseline semantic segmentation results. In addition, the instance mask projection operator works well on other (non-clothing) datasets, providing an improvement of 3 points in miou on thing classes of cityscapes, a self-driving dataset, on top of a state-of-the-art approach.
