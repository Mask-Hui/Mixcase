We construct necessary and sufficient geometric conditions for a class of ads$_2$ solutions of m-theory with, at least, minimal supersymmetry to exist. We generalize previous results in the literature for ${\cal n}=(2,0)$ supersymmetry in ads$_2$ to ${\cal n}=(1,0)$. When the solution can be locally described as ads$_2\times \sigma_g \times \,$se$_7$ with $\sigma_g$ a riemann surface of genus $g$ and se$_7$ a seven-dimensional sasaki-einstein manifold, we clarify and unify various solutions present in the literature. In the case of se$_7=q^{1,1,1}$ we find a new solution with baryonic and mesonic charges turned on simultaneously.
