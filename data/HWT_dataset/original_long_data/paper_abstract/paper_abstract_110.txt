Asymptotically AdS wormhole solutions are considered in the context of
holography. Correlation functions of local operators on distinct boundaries are
studied. It is found that such correlators are finite at short distances.
Correlation functions of non-local operators (Wilson loops) on distinct
boundaries are also studied, with similar conclusions. Deformations of the
theory with multi-trace operators on distinct boundaries are considered and
studied. As a consequence of these results, the dual theory is expected to
factorize in the UV, and the two sectors to be coupled by a soft non-local
interaction. A simple field theory model with such behavior is presented.
