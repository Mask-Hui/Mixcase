We show how series expansions of functions of bosonic number operators are naturally derived from finite-difference calculus. The scheme employs newton series rather than taylor series known from differential calculus, and also works in cases where the taylor expansion fails. For a function of number operators, such an expansion is automatically normal ordered. Applied to the holstein-primakoff representation of spins, the scheme yields an exact series expansion with a finite number of terms and, in addition, allows for a systematic expansion of the spin operators that respects the spin commutation relations within a truncated part of the full hilbert space. Furthermore, the newton series expansion strongly facilitates the calculation of expectation values with respect to coherent states. As a third example, we show that factorial moments and factorial cumulants arising in the context of photon or electron counting are a natural consequence of newton series expansions. Finally, we elucidate the connection between normal ordering, taylor and newton series by determining a corresponding integral transformation, which is related to the mellin transform.
