Objective dyslexia diagnosis is not a straighforward task since it is
traditionally performed by means of the intepretation of different behavioural
tests. Moreover, these tests are only applicable to readers. This way, early
diagnosis requires the use of specific tasks not only related to reading. Thus,
the use of Electroencephalography (EEG) constitutes an alternative for an
objective and early diagnosis that can be used with pre-readers. In this way,
the extraction of relevant features in EEG signals results crucial for
classification. However, the identification of the most relevant features is
not straighforward, and predefined statistics in the time or frequency domain
are not always discriminant enough. On the other hand, classical processing of
EEG signals based on extracting EEG bands frequency descriptors, usually make
some assumptions on the raw signals that could cause indormation loosing. In
this work we propose an alternative for analysis in the frequency domain based
on Singluar Spectrum Analysis (SSA) to split the raw signal into components
representing different oscillatory modes. Moreover, correlation matrices
obtained for each component among EEG channels are classfied using a
Convolutional Neural network.
