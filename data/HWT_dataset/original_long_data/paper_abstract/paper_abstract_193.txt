Novel concepts, perspectives and challenges in measuring and controlling an
open quantum system via sequential schemes are shown. We discuss how similar
protocols, relying both on repeated quantum measurements and dynamical
decoupling control pulses, can allow to: (i) Confine and protect quantum
dynamics from decoherence in accordance with the Zeno physics. (ii)
Analytically predict the probability that a quantum system is transferred into
a target quantum state by means of stochastic sequential measurements. (iii)
Optimally reconstruct the spectral density of environmental noise sources by
orthogonalizing in the frequency domain the filter functions driving the
designed quantum-sensor. The achievement of these tasks will enhance our
capability to observe and manipulate open quantum systems, thus bringing
advances to quantum science and technologies.
