We analyze the cold dark matter density profiles of 54 galaxy halos simulated with fire-2 galaxy formation physics, each resolved within $0.5\%$ of the halo virial radius. These halos contain galaxies with masses that range from ultra-faint dwarfs ($m_\star \simeq 10^{4.5} m_{\odot}$) to the largest spirals ($m_\star \simeq 10^{11} m_{\odot}$) and have density profiles that are both cored and cuspy. We characterize our results using a new analytic density profile that extends the standard einasto form to allow for a pronounced constant-density core in the resolved innermost radius. With one additional core-radius parameter, $r_{c}$, this "core-einasto" profile is able to characterize the shape and normalization of our feedback-impacted dark matter halos. In order to enable comparisons with observations, we provide fitting functions for $r_{c}$ and other profile parameters as a function of both $m_\star$ and $m_{\star}/m_{\rm halo}$. In agreement with similar studies done in the literature, we find that dark matter core formation is most efficient at the characteristic stellar-mass to halo-mass ratio $m_\star/m_{\rm halo} \simeq 5 \times 10^{-3}$, or $m_{\star} \sim 10^9 \, m_{\odot}$, with cores that are roughly the size of the galaxy half-light radius, $r_{c} \simeq 1-5$ kpc. Furthermore, we find no evidence for core formation at radii $\gtrsim 100\ \rm pc$ in galaxies with $m_{\star}/m_{\rm halo} < 5\times 10^{-4}$ or $m_\star \lesssim 10^6 \, m_{\odot}$. For milky way-size galaxies, baryonic contraction often makes halos significantly more concentrated and dense at the stellar half-light radius than dark matter only runs. However, even at the milky way scale, fire-2 galaxy formation still produces small dark matter cores of $\simeq 0.5-2$ kpc in size. Recent evidence for a ${\sim} 2$ kpc core in the milky way's dark matter halo is consistent with this expectation.
