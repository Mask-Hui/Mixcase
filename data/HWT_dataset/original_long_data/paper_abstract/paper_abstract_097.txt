A gauge-invariant mass term for nonabelian gauge fields in two dimensions can
be expressed as the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) action. Hard thermal loops in the
gauge theory in four dimensions at finite temperatures generate a screening
mass for some components of the gauge field. This can be expressed in terms of
the WZW action using the bundle of complex structures (for Euclidean signature)
or the bundle of lightcones over Minkowski space. We show that a dynamically
generated mass term in three dimensions can be put within the same general
framework using using the bundle of Sasakian structures.
