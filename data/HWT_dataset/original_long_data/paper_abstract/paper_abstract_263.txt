We show that heavy ion collisions at the LHC provide a promising environment
to search for new long lived particles in well-motivated New Physics scenarios.
One advantage lies in the possibility to operate the main detectors with looser
triggers, which can increase the number of observable events by orders of
magnitude if the long lived particles are produced with low transverse
momentum. In addition, the absence of pileup in heavy ion collisions can avoid
systematic nuisances that will be present in future proton runs, such as the
problem of vertex mis-identification. Finally, there are new production
mechanisms that are absent or inefficient in proton collisions. We show that
the looser triggers alone can make searches in heavy ion data competitive with
proton data for the specific example of heavy neutrinos in the Neutrino Minimal
Standard Model, produced in the decay of B mesons. Our results suggest that
collisions of ions lighter than lead, which are currently under discussion in
the heavy ion community, are well-motivated from the viewpoint of searches for
New Physics.
