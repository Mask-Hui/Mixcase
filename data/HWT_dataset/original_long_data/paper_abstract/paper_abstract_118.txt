The topological states of matters arising from the nontrivial magnetic
configuration provide a better understanding of physical properties and
functionalities of solid materials. Such studies benefit from the active
control of spin orientation in any solid, which is yet known to rarely take
place in the two-dimensional (2D) limit. Here we demonstrate by the
first-principles calculations that spin-orientation dependent topological
states can appear in the geometrically frustrated monolayer antiferromagnet.
Different topological states including quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect and
time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) broken quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect can be
obtained by changing spin orientation in the NiTl2S4 monolayer. Remarkably, the
dilated nc-AFM NiTl2S4 monolayer gives birth to the QAH effect with hitherto
reported largest number of quantized conducting channels (Chern number C = -4)
in 2D materials. Interestingly, under tunable chemical potential, the nc-AFM
NiTl2S4 monolayer hosts a novel state supporting the coexistence of QAH and TRS
broken QSH effects with a Chern number C = 3 and spin Chern number C_s = 1.
This work manifests a promising concept and material realization toward
topological spintronics in 2D antiferromagnets by manipulating its spin degree
of freedom.
