We report (semi-)analytical solutions of a benchmark problem for rigorously
testing coupled incompressible fluid--elastic solid interaction algorithms. The
problem involves a visco-hyperelastic solid material layer sandwiched between
two fluid layers, in turn confined by two long planar walls. The walls undergo
oscillatory motion which drive a characteristic system response. The governing
equations in this setting reduce to one-dimension and admit (semi-)analytical
solutions, whose form depends on fluid viscosity and solid elasticity. Using
these solutions, we highlight specific parameter settings that serve as
rigorous, challenging long-time benchmarks for validating multiphase solvers,
in the context of FSI simulations.
