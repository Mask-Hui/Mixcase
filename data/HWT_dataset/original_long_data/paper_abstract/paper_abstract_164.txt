This article investigates the mahler measure of a family of 2-variate polynomials, denoted by $p_d, d\geq 1$, unbounded in both degree and genus. By using a closed formula for the mahler measure introduced in "volume function and mahler measure of exact polynomials" (by guilloux and march\'e), we are able to compute $m(p_d)$, for arbitrary $d$, as a sum of the values of dilogarithm at special roots of unity. We prove that $m(p_d)$ converges and the limit is proportional to $\zeta(3)$, where $\zeta$ is the riemann zeta function.
