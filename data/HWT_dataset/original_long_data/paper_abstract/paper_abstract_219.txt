Thermoelectric properties of graphene nanoribbons doped by magnetic impurities fe and co are carried out in room temperature. We report on a study of the band structure dependent properties such as electrical conductivity, charge of carriers and seebeck coefficients. We investigate the thermoelectric properties using the semi-classical boltzmann method. The electronic band structure of doped nanoribbons are evaluated by using density-functional theory in which the hubbard interaction is considered. In this work we compare the different types of the nanoribbons and their thermoelectric features in the presence and absence of the magnetic impurities and discuss the importance of the distance between impurities and the edge of the nanoribbons.
