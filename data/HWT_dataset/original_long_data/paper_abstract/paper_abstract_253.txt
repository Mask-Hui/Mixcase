The robust chinese remainder theorem (crt) has been recently proposed for robustly reconstructing a large nonnegative integer from erroneous remainders. It has found many applications in signal processing, including phase unwrapping and frequency estimation under sub-nyquist sampling. Motivated by the applications in multidimensional (md) signal processing, in this paper we propose the md-crt and robust md-crt for integer vectors. Specifically, by rephrasing the abstract crt for rings in number-theoretic terms, we first derive the md-crt for integer vectors with respect to a general set of integer matrix moduli, which provides an algorithm to uniquely reconstruct an integer vector from its remainders, if it is in the fundamental parallelepiped of the lattice generated by a least common right multiple of all the moduli. For some special forms of moduli, we present explicit reconstruction formulae. Moreover, we derive the robust md-crt for integer vectors when the remaining integer matrices of all the moduli left divided by their greatest common left divisor (gcld) are pairwise commutative and coprime. Two different reconstruction algorithms are proposed, and accordingly, two different conditions on the remainder error bound for the reconstruction robustness are obtained, which are related to a quarter of the minimum distance of the lattice generated by the gcld of all the moduli or the smith normal form of the gcld.
