The dielectric constant, which defines the polarization of the media, is a
key quantity in condensed matter. It determines several electronic and
optoelectronic properties important for a plethora of modern technologies from
computer memory to field effect transistors and communication circuits.
Moreover, the importance of the dielectric constant in describing
electromagnetic interactions through screening plays a critical role in
understanding fundamental molecular interactions. Here we show that despite its
fundamental transcendence, the dielectric constant does not define
unequivocally the dielectric properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials due
to the locality of their electrostatic screening. Instead, the electronic
polarizability correctly captures the dielectric nature of a 2D material which
is united to other physical quantities in an atomically thin layer. We reveal a
long-sought universal formalism where electronic, geometrical and dielectric
properties are intrinsically correlated through the polarizability opening the
door to probe quantities yet not directly measurable including the real
covalent thickness of a layer. We unify the concept of dielectric properties in
any material dimension finding a global dielectric anisotropy index defining
their controllability through dimensionality.
