This work considers the problem of control and resource scheduling in
networked systems. We present DIRA, a Deep reinforcement learning based
Iterative Resource Allocation algorithm, which is scalable and control-aware.
Our algorithm is tailored towards large-scale problems where control and
scheduling need to act jointly to optimize performance. DIRA can be used to
schedule general time-domain optimization based controllers. In the present
work, we focus on control designs based on suitably adapted linear quadratic
regulators. We apply our algorithm to networked systems with correlated fading
communication channels. Our simulations show that DIRA scales well to large
scheduling problems.
