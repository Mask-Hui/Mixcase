DESlib is an open-source python library providing the implementation of
several dynamic selection techniques. The library is divided into three
modules: (i) \emph{dcs}, containing the implementation of dynamic classifier
selection methods (DCS); (ii) \emph{des}, containing the implementation of
dynamic ensemble selection methods (DES); (iii) \emph{static}, with the
implementation of static ensemble techniques. The library is fully documented
(documentation available online on Read the Docs), has a high test coverage
(codecov.io) and is part of the scikit-learn-contrib supported projects.
Documentation, code and examples can be found on its GitHub page:
