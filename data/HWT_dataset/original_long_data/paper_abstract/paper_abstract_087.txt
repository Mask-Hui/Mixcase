The observability of charged higgs $ h^{\pm} $ has been investigated at future lepton collider by assuming type-i 2hdm at a centre of mass energy $ \sqrt{s}=1.5$ tev. The signal process chain is $ e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow z^{*}/ \gamma^{*}\rightarrow h^{+} h^{-}\rightarrow h^{0} w^{+} h^{0} w^{-}\rightarrow l^{+} l^{-} b \overline{b} b \overline{b} \nu \overline{\nu}$. The process proceeds through s-channel, virtual gamma and z-boson exchange. Several benchmark points are selected and mass of the charged higgs bosons $ h^{\pm} $ is reconstructed by analysing the events. The value of tan $ \beta $ is kept relatively high to enhance the branching ratio of $ h^{0}\rightarrow b\overline{b} $ to benefit the signal processes. The produced $ t\overline{t} $ and vector bosons are the main background processes in sm. Signal selection efficiencies and signal significance efficiency are calculated for integrated luminosities of $100 fb^{-1} $, $ 500 fb^{-1} $, $ 1000 fb^{-1} $ and $ 5000 fb^{-1} $. Reconstructed and corrected mass of charged higgs bosons $ h^{\pm} $ is determined. Through analyzing the results it is demonstrated that charged higgs can be discovered through pair production process via its bosonic decays. This study is supposed to provide the experimentalists a good way to examine the higgs bosons beyond sm as well as to check the validity of 2hdm models in considered parameter space.
