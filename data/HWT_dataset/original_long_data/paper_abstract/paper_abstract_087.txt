The observability of charged Higgs $ H^{\pm} $ has been investigated at
future lepton collider by assuming type-I 2HDM at a centre of mass energy $
\sqrt{s}=1.5$ TeV. The signal process chain is $ e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow Z^{*}/
\gamma^{*}\rightarrow H^{+} H^{-}\rightarrow H^{0} W^{+} H^{0} W^{-}\rightarrow
l^{+} l^{-} b \overline{b} b \overline{b} \nu \overline{\nu}$. The process
proceeds through s-channel, virtual gamma and Z-boson exchange. Several
benchmark points are selected and mass of the charged Higgs bosons $ H^{\pm} $
is reconstructed by analysing the events. The value of tan $ \beta $ is kept
relatively high to enhance the branching ratio of $ H^{0}\rightarrow
b\overline{b} $ to benefit the signal processes. The produced $ t\overline{t} $
and vector bosons are the main background processes in SM. Signal selection
efficiencies and signal significance efficiency are calculated for integrated
luminosities of $100 fb^{-1} $, $ 500 fb^{-1} $, $ 1000 fb^{-1} $ and $ 5000
fb^{-1} $. Reconstructed and corrected mass of charged Higgs bosons $ H^{\pm} $
is determined. Through analyzing the results it is demonstrated that charged
Higgs can be discovered through pair production process via its bosonic decays.
This study is supposed to provide the experimentalists a good way to examine
the Higgs bosons beyond SM as well as to check the validity of 2HDM models in
considered parameter space.
