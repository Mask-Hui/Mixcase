The in-medium mass and decay width of the $\phi$ meson in the hot asymmetric strange hadronic matter are calculated using an effective lagrangian approach for $\phi$ $k\bar k$ interaction. The in-medium contributions of $k \bar k$ loop to the $\phi$ meson self-energy are computed by the medium modified kaon and antikaon mass which is evaluated using the chiral su(3) model. To deal with the ultraviolet divergence, we regularize the loop integral of self-energy with a dipole form factor, and present the results for cut-off mass, $\lambda_c$=3 gev. In chiral model calculations, for strange matter, we find that the mass of kaons and antikaons decreases with the increase in baryonic density whereas the finite temperature causes an increase in the mass. We observed that the in-medium $\phi$ meson mass decreases slowly with baryonic density whereas the decay width increases rapidly. The results in the present investigation support result in the literature which indicate a small downward shift in mass and a large broadening in the decay width. In the asymmetric strange hadronic matter, the study of the $\phi$ mesons can be relevant for the compressed strange baryonic matter and experimental observables such as dilepton spectra which can result from the experiments in the future fair facility at gsi.
