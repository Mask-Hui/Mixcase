We present quantum algorithms for adiabatic state preparation on a gate-based
quantum computer, with complexity polylogarithmic in the inverse error. This
constitutes an exponential improvement over existing methods, which achieve
subpolynomial error dependence. Our first algorithm digitally simulates the
adiabatic evolution between two self-adjoint operators $H_0$ and $H_1$,
exponentially suppressing the diabatic error by harnessing the theoretical
concept of quasi-adiabatic continuation as an algorithmic tool. Given an upper
bound $\alpha$ on $\|H_0\|$ and $\|H_1\|$ along with the promise that the $k$th
eigenstate $|\psi_k(s)\rangle$ of $H(s) \equiv (1-s)H_0 + sH_1$ is separated
from the rest of the spectrum by a gap of at least $\gamma > 0$ for all $s \in
[0,1]$, this algorithm implements an operator $\widetilde{U}$ such that $\|
|\psi_k(1)\rangle - \widetilde{U}|\psi_k(s)\rangle\| \leq \epsilon$ using
$\mathcal{O}(({\alpha^2}/{\gamma^2})\mathrm{polylog}(\alpha/\gamma\epsilon))$
queries to block-encodings of $H_0$ and $H_1$. Our second algorithm is
applicable only to ground states and requires multiple queries to an oracle
that prepares $|\psi_0(0)\rangle$, but has slightly better scaling in all
parameters. We also show that the costs of both algorithms can be further
reduced under certain reasonable conditions, such as when $\|H_1 - H_0\|$ is
small compared to $\alpha$, or when more information about the gap of $H(s)$ is
available. For certain problems, the scaling can even be improved to linear in
$\|H_1 - H_0\|/\gamma$ up to polylogarithmic factors.
