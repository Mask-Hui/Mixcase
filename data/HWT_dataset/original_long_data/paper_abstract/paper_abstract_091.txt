We investigate the problem of multiple time series forecasting, with the objective to improve multiple-step-ahead predictions. We propose a multi-task gaussian process framework to simultaneously model batches of individuals with a common mean function and a specific covariance structure. This common mean is defined as a gaussian process for which the hyper-posterior distribution is tractable. Therefore an em algorithm can be derived for simultaneous hyper-parameters optimisation and hyper-posterior computation. Unlike previous approaches in the literature, we account for uncertainty and handle uncommon grids of observations while maintaining explicit formulations, by modelling the mean process in a non-parametric probabilistic framework. We also provide predictive formulas integrating this common mean process. This approach greatly improves the predictive performance far from observations, where information shared across individuals provides a relevant prior mean. Our overall algorithm is called \textsc{magma} (standing for multi task gaussian processes with common mean), and publicly available as a r package. The quality of the mean process estimation, predictive performances, and comparisons to alternatives are assessed in various simulated scenarios and on real datasets.
