We investigate the problem of multiple time series forecasting, with the
objective to improve multiple-step-ahead predictions. We propose a multi-task
Gaussian process framework to simultaneously model batches of individuals with
a common mean function and a specific covariance structure. This common mean is
defined as a Gaussian process for which the hyper-posterior distribution is
tractable. Therefore an EM algorithm can be derived for simultaneous
hyper-parameters optimisation and hyper-posterior computation. Unlike previous
approaches in the literature, we account for uncertainty and handle uncommon
grids of observations while maintaining explicit formulations, by modelling the
mean process in a non-parametric probabilistic framework. We also provide
predictive formulas integrating this common mean process. This approach greatly
improves the predictive performance far from observations, where information
shared across individuals provides a relevant prior mean. Our overall algorithm
is called \textsc{Magma} (standing for Multi tAsk Gaussian processes with
common MeAn), and publicly available as a R package. The quality of the mean
process estimation, predictive performances, and comparisons to alternatives
are assessed in various simulated scenarios and on real datasets.
