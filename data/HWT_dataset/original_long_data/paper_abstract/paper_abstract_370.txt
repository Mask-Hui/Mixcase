An important problem in space-time adaptive detection is the estimation of the large p-by-p interference covariance matrix from training signals. When the number of training signals n is greater than 2p, existing estimators are generally considered to be adequate, as demonstrated by fixed-dimensional asymptotics. But in the low-sample-support regime (n < 2p or even n < p) fixed-dimensional asymptotics are no longer applicable. The remedy undertaken in this paper is to consider the "large dimensional limit" in which n and p go to infinity together. In this asymptotic regime, a new type of estimator is defined (definition 2), shown to exist (theorem 1), and shown to be detection-theoretically ideal (theorem 2). Further, asymptotic conditional detection and false-alarm rates of filters formed from this type of estimator are characterized (theorems 3 and 4) and shown to depend only on data that is given, even for non-gaussian interference statistics. The paper concludes with several monte carlo simulations that compare the performance of the estimator in theorem 1 to the predictions of theorems 2-4, showing in particular higher detection probability than steiner and gerlach's fast maximum likelihood estimator.
