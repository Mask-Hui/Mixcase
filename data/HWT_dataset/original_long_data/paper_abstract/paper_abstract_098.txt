The $N=1$ supersymmetric Born-Infeld theory coupled to $N=1$ supergravity in
four spacetime dimensions is studied in the presence of a cosmological term
with spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. The consistency is achieved by
compensating a negative contribution to the cosmological term from the
Born-Infeld theory by a positive contribution originating from the gravitino
condensate. This leads to an identification of the Born-Infeld scale with the
supersymmetry breaking scale. The dynamical formation of the gravitino
condensate in supergravity is reconsidered and the induced one-loop effective
potential is derived. Slow roll cosmological inflation with the gravitino
condensate as the inflaton (near the maximum of the effective potential) is
viable against the Planck 2018 data and can lead to the inflationary (Hubble)
scale as high as $10^{12}$ GeV. Uplifting the Minkowski vacuum (after
inflation) to a de Sitter vacuum (dark energy) is possible by the use of the
alternative Fayet-Iliopoulos term. Some major physical consequences of our
scenario to reheating are briefly discussed also.
