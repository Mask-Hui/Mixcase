In this work, a generalization of the study of the human gait was made from
already existent models in the literature, like models of Keller and
Kockshenev. In this hybrid model, a strategy of metabolic energy minimization
is combined in a race process, with a non-linear description of the movement of
the mass center's libration, trying to reproduce the behavior of the walk-run
transition. The results of the experimental data, for different speed regimes,
indicate that the perimeter of the trajectory of the mass center is a relevant
quantity in the quantification of this dynamic. An experimental procedure was
put into practice in collaboration with the research group in Biomedical
Engineering, Basic Sciences and Laboratories of the Manuela Beltr\'an
University in Bogot\'a, Colombia.
