Multi-party computation (mpc) is a technique enabling data from several sources to be used in a secure computation revealing only the result while protecting the original data, facilitating shared utilization of data sets gathered by different entities. The presence of field programmable gate array (fpga) hardware in datacenters can provide accelerated computing as well as low latency, high bandwidth communication that bolsters the performance of mpc and lowers the barrier to using mpc for many applications. In this work, we propose a secret sharing fpga design based on the protocol described by araki et al. We compare our hardware design to the original authors' software implementations of secret sharing and to work accelerating mpc protocols based on garbled circuits with fpgas. Our conclusion is that secret sharing in the datacenter is competitive and when implemented on fpga hardware was able to use at least 10$\times$ fewer computer resources than the original work using cpus.
