We present time-lapse spectroscopy of a classical nova explosion commencing 9
days after discovery. These data reveal the appearance of a transient feature
in Fe II and [O I]. We explore different models for this feature and conclude
that it is best explained by a circumbinary disc shock-heated following the
classical nova event. Circumbinary discs may play an important role in novae in
accounting for the absorption systems known as THEA, the transfer of angular
momentum, and the possible triggering of the nova event itself.
