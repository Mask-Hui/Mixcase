In order to determine the 3D structure of a thick sample, researchers have
recently combined ptychography (for high resolution) and tomography (for 3D
imaging) in a single experiment. 2-step methods are usually adopted for
reconstruction, where the ptychography and tomography problems are often solved
independently. In this paper, we provide a novel model and ADMM-based algorithm
to jointly solve the ptychography-tomography problem iteratively, also
employing total variation regularization. The proposed method permits large
scan stepsizes for the ptychography experiment, requiring less measurements and
being more robust to noise with respect to other strategies, while achieving
higher reconstruction quality results.
