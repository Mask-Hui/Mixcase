In this paper we explore the possibility of observable gravitational waves as a manifestation of the qcd axion dynamics. In particular, we focus on dynamical axion models which solve the strong cp problem, and include the confinement of a qcd-like gauge group at the tev scale. We study the resulting chiral symmetry breaking phase transition for models with $n_f=3$ and $n_f=4$ light flavors using the linear sigma model. This model describes the scalar meson spectrum and its interactions, with the diagonal field $\varphi$ as the order parameter. We find that the amplitude of the gravitational wave spectrum depends on the mass of the dynamical axion $\eta'$ via the ratio $m_{\eta'}/m_\varphi$. The resulting spectra may be observed at future mid-range gravitational wave experiments such as aion/magis, decigo, and bbo. Moreover, the tev states can be searched for at colliders and their quantum numbers characterized, providing a unique connection between axion physics, gravitational waves and collider searches.
