This paper is a short exposition of Stein's method of normal approximation
from my personal perspective. It focuses mainly on the characterization of the
normal distribution and the construction of Stein identities. Through examples,
it provides glimpses into the many approaches to constructing Stein identities
and the diverse applications of Stein's method to mathematical problems. It
also includes anecdotes of historical interest, including how Stein discovered
his method and how I found an unpublished proof of his of the Berry-Esseen
theorem.
