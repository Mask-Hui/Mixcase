Ultrahigh-resolution fiber-optic sensing has been demonstrated with a
meter-long, high-finesse fiber Fabry-Perot interferometer (FFPI). The main
technical challenge of large, environment-induced resonance frequency drift is
addressed by locking the interrogation laser to a similar meter-long FFPI,
which, along with the FFPI sensor, is thermally and mechanically isolated from
the ambient. A nominal, noise-limited strain resolution of 800 f{\epsilon}
/sqrt(Hz) has been achieved within 1 to 100 Hz. Strain resolution further
improves to 75 f{\epsilon} /sqrt(Hz) at 1 kHz, 60 f{\epsilon} /sqrt(Hz) at 2
kHz and 40 f{\epsilon} /sqrt(Hz) at 23 kHz, demonstrating comparable or even
better resolutions than proven techniques such as {\pi}-phase-shifted and
slow-light fiber Bragg gratings. Limitations of the current system are analyzed
and improvement strategies are presented. The work lays out a feasible path
toward ultrahigh-resolution fiber-optic sensing based on long FFPIs.
