Majorana fermions cannot be found in nature as a free fundamental particle.
Nevertheless, in condensed matter systems, they can emerge as a collective
excitation. In this work, using functional integration techniques, we
calculated the effective potential for emergent Majorana fermions in the Kitaev
chain. In this case, we have shown how the superconductor parameter behaves as
a function of temperature. Furthermore, we considered surface-induced
superconductivity in a Topological Insulator and calculated the effective
potential for emergent Majorana fermions in this system. In the case of an
s-wave superconductor, we obtained a gap equation equivalent to that one
appearing in a quasi-two-dimensional Dirac electronic system, a candidate to
explain high-Tc superconductivity. Finally, for the p-wave superconductor, we
have obtained a critical value of the electronelectron interaction in the
surface of the Topological Insulator, determining the existence or not of
induced superconductivity, a remarkable result to guide experiments
