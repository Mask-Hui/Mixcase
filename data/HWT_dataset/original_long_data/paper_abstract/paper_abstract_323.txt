Purpose: to develop an accelerated, robust, and accurate diffusion mri acquisition and reconstruction technique for submillimeter whole human brain in-vivo scan on a clinical scanner. Methods: we extend the ultra-high resolution diffusion mri acquisition technique, gslider, by allowing under-sampling in q-space and radio-frequency (rf)-encoded data, thereby accelerating the total acquisition time of conventional gslider. The novel method, termed gslider-sr, compensates for the lack of acquired information by exploiting redundancy in the dmri data using a basis of spherical ridgelets (sr), while simultaneously enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio. Using monte-carlo simulation with realistic noise levels and several acquisitions of in-vivo human brain dmri data (acquired on a siemens prisma 3t scanner), we demonstrate the efficacy of our method using several quantitative metrics. Results: for high-resolution dmri data with realistic noise levels (synthetically added), we show that gslider-sr can reconstruct high-quality dmri data at different acceleration factors preserving both signal and angular information. With in-vivo data, we demonstrate that gslider-sr can accurately reconstruct 860 ${\mu}m$ diffusion mri data (64 diffusion directions at b = 2000 $s/ {mm}^2$), at comparable quality as that obtained with conventional gslider with four averages, thereby providing an eight-fold reduction in scan time (from 1 h 20 min to 10 min). Conclusion: gslider-sr enables whole-brain high angular resolution dmri at a submillimeter spatial resolution with a dramatically reduced acquisition time, making it feasible to use the proposed scheme on existing clinical scanners.
