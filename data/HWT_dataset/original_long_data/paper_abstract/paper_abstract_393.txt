Contrary to what is usually known for the casas-ibarra parametrization of the dirac neutrino mass matrix in the type-i seesaw model, the pmns neutrino mixing matrix $u$ may get involved in the treatment of the leptogenesis process when the renormalization group running effect is taken into account. In this paper, we investigate such renormalization group assisted leptogenesis in the economical and predictive minimal type-i seesaw model. Our attention will be devoted to the interesting possibility that the cp violation necessary for a successful leptogenesis is exclusively owing to the cp phases in $u$.
