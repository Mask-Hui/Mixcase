Contrary to what is usually known for the Casas-Ibarra parametrization of the
Dirac neutrino mass matrix in the type-I seesaw model, the PMNS neutrino mixing
matrix $U$ may get involved in the treatment of the leptogenesis process when
the renormalization group running effect is taken into account. In this paper,
we investigate such renormalization group assisted leptogenesis in the
economical and predictive minimal type-I seesaw model. Our attention will be
devoted to the interesting possibility that the CP violation necessary for a
successful leptogenesis is exclusively owing to the CP phases in $U$.
