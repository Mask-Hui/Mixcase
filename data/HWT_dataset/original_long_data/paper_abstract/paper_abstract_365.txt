In this article we present a methodology to estimate the transfer entropy rate between two systems through the lempel-ziv complexity. This methodology carries a set of practical advantages: it can be estimated from two single discrete series of measures, it is not computationally expensive and it does not assume any model for the data. The results of simulations over three different unidirectional coupled systems, suggest that this methodology can be used to assess the direction and strength of the information flow between systems.
