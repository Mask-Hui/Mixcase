We report a magnetotransport study of spin relaxation in 1.4-21.2 nm
epitaxial SrIrO$_3$ thin films coherently strained on SrTiO$_3$ substrates.
Fully charge compensated semimetallic transport has been observed in SrIrO$_3$
films thicker than 1.6 nm, where the charge mobility at 10 K increases from 45
cm$^2$/Vs to 150 cm$^2$/Vs with decreasing film thickness. In the
two-dimensional regime, the charge dephasing and spin-orbit scattering lengths
extracted from the weak localization/anti-localization effects show power-law
dependence on temperature, pointing to the important role of electron-electron
interaction. The spin-orbit scattering time $\tau_\text{so}$ exhibits an
Elliott-Yafet mechanism dominated quasi-linear dependence on the momentum
relaxation time $\tau_\text{p}$. Ultrathin films approaching the critical
thickness of metal-insulator transition show an abrupt enhancement in
$\tau_\text{so}$, with the corresponding $\tau_\text{so}/\tau_\text{p}$ about
7.6 times of the value for thicker films. A likely origin for such unusual
enhancement is the onset of strong electron correlation, which leads to charge
gap formation and suppresses spin scattering.
