We perform explorative analyses of the 3d gluon content of the proton via a study of (un)polarized twist-2 gluon tmds, calculated in a spectator model for the parent nucleon. Our approach encodes a flexible parametrization for the spectator-mass density, suited to describe both moderate and small-$x$ effects. All these prospective developments are relevant in the investigation of the gluon dynamics inside nucleons and nuclei, which constitutes one of the major goals of new-generation colliding machines, as the eic, the hl-lhc and nica.
