This work analyses the performance-complexity tradeoff for different
direction of arrival (DoA) estimation techniques. Such tradeoff is investigated
taking into account uniform linear array structures. Several DoA estimation
techniques have been compared, namely the conventional Delay-and-Sum (DS),
Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR), Multiple Signal Classifier
(MUSIC) subspace, Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance
Technique (ESPRIT), Unitary-ESPRIT and Fourier Transform method (FT-DoA). The
analytical formulation of each estimation technique as well the comparative
numerical results are discussed focused on the estimation accuracy versus
complexity tradeoff. The present study reveals the behavior of seven
techniques, demonstrating promising ones for current and future location
applications involving DoA estimation, especially for 5G massive MIMO systems.
