Here, we present a kinematical analysis of the virgo cluster ultra-diffuse galaxy (udg) vcc 1287 based on data taken with the keck cosmic web imager (kcwi). We confirm vcc 1287's association both with the virgo cluster and its globular cluster (gc) system, measuring a recessional velocity of $1116 \pm 2\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. We measure a stellar velocity dispersion ($19 \pm 6\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$) and infer both a dynamical mass ($1.11^{+0.81}_{-0.81} \times 10^{9} \ \mathrm{m_{\odot}}$) and mass to light ratio ($13^{+11}_{-11}$) within the half light radius (4.4 kpc). This places vcc 1287 slightly above the well established relation for normal galaxies, with a higher mass to light ratio for its dynamical mass than normal galaxies. We use our dynamical mass, and an estimate of gc system richness, to place vcc 1287 on the gc number -- dynamical mass relation, finding good agreement with a sample of normal galaxies. Based on a total halo mass derived from gc counts, we then infer that vcc 1287 likely resides in a cored or low concentration dark matter halo. Based on the comparison of our measurements to predictions from simulations, we find that strong stellar feedback and/or tidal effects are plausibly the dominant mechanisms in the formation of vcc 1287. Finally, we compare our measurement of the dynamical mass with those for other udgs. These dynamical mass estimates suggest relatively massive halos and a failed galaxy origin for at least some udgs.
