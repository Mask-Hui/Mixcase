We consider a family of $\kappa$-Poincar\'e invariant scalar field theories
on 4-d $\kappa$-Minkowski space with quartic orientable interaction, that is
for which $\phi$ and its conjugate $\phi^\dag$ alternate in the quartic
interaction, and whose kinetic operator is the square of a
$U_\kappa(iso(4))$-equivariant Dirac operator. The formal commutative limit
yields the standard complex $\phi^4$ theory. We find that the 2-point function
receives UV linearly diverging 1-loop corrections while it stays free of IR
singularities that would signal occurrence of UV/IR mixing. We find that all
the 1-loop planar and non-planar contributions to the 4-point function are UV
finite, stemming from the existence of the particular estimate for the
propagator partly combined with its decay properties at large momenta, implying
formally vanishing of the beta-functions at 1-loop so that the coupling
constants stay scale-invariant at 1-loop.
