We address the effect of orientation of the accretion disk plane and the
geometry of the broad-line region (BLR) in the context of understanding the
distribution of quasars along their Main Sequence. We utilize the
photoionization code CLOUDY to model the BLR, incorporating the `un-constant'
virial factor. We show the preliminary results of the analysis to highlight the
co-dependence of the Eigenvector 1 parameter, $\mathrm{R_{FeII}}$ on the broad
H$\beta$ FWHM (i.e. the line dispersion) and the inclination angle ($\theta$),
assuming fixed values for the Eddington ratio
($\mathrm{L_{bol}}/\mathrm{L_{Edd}}$), black hole mass ($\mathrm{M_{BH}}$),
spectral energy distribution (SED) shape, cloud density (n$\rm{_{H}}$) and
composition.
