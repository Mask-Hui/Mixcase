The Two-body problem of $M31$ and the Milky Way (MW) galaxies with a
Cosmological Constant background is studied, with emphasis on the possibility
that they experienced Past Encounters. By implementing the Timing Argument
(TA), it is shown that if $M{31}$ and the MW have had more than one encounter
then the deduced mass of the Local Group (LG) would be larger. Past encounters
are possible only for non-zero transverse velocity, and their viability is
subject to observations of the imprints of such near collisions. Using a recent
$Gaia$ - based measurement of the transverse velocity we show that the presence
of the Cosmological Constant requires the mass for the LG to be $35\%$ higher:
$3.36^{+1.14}_{-0.70} \cdot 10^{12} M_{\odot}$ with no Cosmological Constant or
$4.54^{+1.20}_{-0.75} \cdot 10^{12} M_{\odot}$ with a Cosmological Constant
background. If the LG has had one past encounter, the LG mass is
$9.99^{+2.22}_{-1.58}\cdot 10^{12} M_{\odot}$ with a Cosmological Constant
background. Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is studied as the accelerations
of the Local Group are fully in the deep-MOND regime. MOND yields the order of
magnitude for the expected baryonic mass only if at least one encounter
occurred. While we only consider the LG as two point masses, our calculations
provide a benchmark for future work with simulations to test Dynamical Friction
and other effects. This model can be also used to test screening mechanisms and
alternative theories of gravity.
