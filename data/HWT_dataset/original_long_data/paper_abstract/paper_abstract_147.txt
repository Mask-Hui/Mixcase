In this paper, we regard the $t\bar{t}$/$j\bar{t}$-deformed cfts as perturbation theories and calculate the first order correction of the correlation functions due to the $t\bar{t}$/$j\bar{t}$-deformation. As applications, we study the r\'enyi entanglement entropy of excited state in the $t\bar{t}$/$j\bar{t}$-deformed two-dimensional cfts. We find, up to the perturbation first order of the deformation, the r\'enyi entanglement entropy of locally excited states will acquire a non-trivial time dependence. The excess of the r\'enyi entanglement entropy of locally excited state will also be dramatically changed up to order ${\cal o}(c)$. Furthermore, the out of time ordered correlation function is investigated to confirm that the $t\bar{t}$/$j\bar{t}$-deformations do not change the maximal chaotic behavior of holographic cfts up to the first order of the deformations.
