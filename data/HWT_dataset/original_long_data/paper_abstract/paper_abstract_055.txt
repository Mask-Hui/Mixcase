We carried out a comprehensive study of magnetic critical behavior in single crystals of ternary chalcogenide fecr$_2$te$_4$ that undergoes a ferrimagnetic transition below $t_c$ $\sim$ 123 k. Detailed critical behavior analysis and scaled magnetic entropy change indicate a second-order ferrimagentic transition. Critical exponents $\beta = 0.30(1)$ with $t_c = 122.4(5)$ k, $\gamma = 1.22(1)$ with $t_c = 122.8(1)$ k, and $\delta = 4.24(2)$ at $t_c$ $\sim$ 123 k suggest that the spins approach three-dimensional ising ($\beta$ = 0.325, $\gamma$ = 1.24, and $\delta$ = 4.82) model coupled with the attractive long-range interactions between spins that decay as $j(r)\approx r^{-4.88}$. Our results suggest that the ferrimagnetism in fecr$_2$te$_4$ is due to itinerant ferromagnetism among the antiferromagnetically coupled cr-fe-cr trimers.
