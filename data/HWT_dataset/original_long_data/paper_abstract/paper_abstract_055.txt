We carried out a comprehensive study of magnetic critical behavior in single
crystals of ternary chalcogenide FeCr$_2$Te$_4$ that undergoes a ferrimagnetic
transition below $T_c$ $\sim$ 123 K. Detailed critical behavior analysis and
scaled magnetic entropy change indicate a second-order ferrimagentic
transition. Critical exponents $\beta = 0.30(1)$ with $T_c = 122.4(5)$ K,
$\gamma = 1.22(1)$ with $T_c = 122.8(1)$ K, and $\delta = 4.24(2)$ at $T_c$
$\sim$ 123 K suggest that the spins approach three-dimensional Ising ($\beta$ =
0.325, $\gamma$ = 1.24, and $\delta$ = 4.82) model coupled with the attractive
long-range interactions between spins that decay as $J(r)\approx r^{-4.88}$.
Our results suggest that the ferrimagnetism in FeCr$_2$Te$_4$ is due to
itinerant ferromagnetism among the antiferromagnetically coupled Cr-Fe-Cr
trimers.
