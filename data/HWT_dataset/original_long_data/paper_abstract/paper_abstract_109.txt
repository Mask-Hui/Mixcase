We studied a small comet-shape reflection nebula, located in the dark cloud
SL 4 in the Vela Molecular Ridge cloud C, known as BBWo 192E (GM 1-23), and a
young infrared cluster embedded into the nebula, for the evidences of recent
star formation. We obtained the images of BBWo 192E in Halpha and [SII] lines
and in SDSS i' with Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican
Observatory to discover new Herbig-Haro (HH) flows. 2MASS and WISE surveys were
used for the search of the additional member stars of the cluster. We also
studied proper motions and parallaxes of the cluster members with the aid of
GAIA DR2. Five new groups containing at least 9 HH objects tracing several
distinct outflows were revealed. A previously unreported reflection nebula and
a number of probable outflow sources were found in the infrared range. The
proper motions allowed selecting eight probable member stars in the visual
range. Their parallaxes correspond to a mean distance 800 +/- 100 pc for this
cluster. The bolometric luminosities of the brightest cluster members are 1010
L(sun) (IRAS 08513-4201,the strong source in the center of the cluster) and 2
to 6 L(sun) for the five other stars. The existence of the optical HH flows
around the infrared cluster of YSOs suggests that star formation in this cloud
is on-going around the more massive HAeBe star. By its morphology and other
features this star-forming region is similar to the zone of star formation near
CPM 19.
