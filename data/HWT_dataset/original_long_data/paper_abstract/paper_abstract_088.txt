We suppose that a l\'evy process is observed at discrete time points. Starting from an asymptotically minimax family of estimators for the continuous part of the l\'evy khinchine characteristics, i.e., the covariance, we derive a data-driven parameter choice for the frequency of estimating the covariance. We investigate a lepski\u{i}-type stopping rule for the adaptive procedure. Consequently, we use a balancing principle for the best possible data-driven parameter. The adaptive estimator achieves almost the optimal rate. Numerical experiments with the proposed selection rule are also presented.
