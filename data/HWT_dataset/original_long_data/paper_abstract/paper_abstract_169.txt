Based on the numerical method proposed in [g. Hu, x. Xie, f. Xu, j. Comput. Phys., 355 (2018), 436-449.] for kohn-sham equation, further improvement on the efficiency is obtained in this paper by i). Designing a numerical method with the strategy of separately handling the nonlinear hartree potential and exchange-correlation potential, and ii).parallelizing the algorithm in an eigenpairwise approach. The feasibility of two approaches are analyzed in detail, and the new algorithm is described completely. Compared with previous results, a significant improvement of numerical efficiency can be observed from plenty of numerical experiments, which make the new method more suitable for the practical problems.
