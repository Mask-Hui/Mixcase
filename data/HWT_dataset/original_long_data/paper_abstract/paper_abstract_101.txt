Quantum coherence is the most distinguished signature of quantum mechanics,
also recognized to be an essential resource for many promising quantum
technologies, playing a central role in phenomena related to quantum
information science, quantum thermodynamics and quantum biology, just to
mention few examples. However, the resource theory of coherence is in the
preliminary stage of its development, being still limited to the study of the
manipulation and quantification of coherence, mostly from a theoretical
viewpoint. Here, we propose an experimental method to directly measure the
relative entropy of coherence, which according to the resource theory is one of
the main quantifiers of coherence. To achieve this aim, we show how to measure
the von Neumann entropy of a generic quantum state directly in terms of the
Shannon entropy of the probability distribution of outcomes in a defined
measurement basis. In both cases, by direct we mean that tomographic methods
are not required. Two quantum-optical applications of our method are discussed
in order to give support to our predictions.
