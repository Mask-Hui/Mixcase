The stringent constraints from the direct searches for exotic scalars at the
LHC as well as indirect bounds from flavor physics measurements have imposed
severe restrictions on the parameter space of new physics models featuring
extended Higgs sectors. In the Type-II 2HDM, this implies a lower bound on the
charged Higgs masses of $\cal O$(600 GeV). In this work we analyze the
phenomenology of a Z3HDM in the alignment limit focusing on the impact of
flavor physics constraints on its parameter space. We show that the couplings
of the two charged Higgs bosons in this model feature an additional suppression
factor compared to Type-II 2HDM. This gives rise to a significant relaxation of
the flavor physics constraints in this model, allowing the charged Higgs masses
to be as low as $\cal O$(200 GeV). We also consider the constraints coming from
precision electroweak observables and the observed diphoton decay rate of the
125 GeV Higgs boson at the LHC. The bounds coming from the direct searches of
nonstandard Higgs bosons at the LHC, particularly those from resonance searches
in the ditau channel, prove to be very effective in constraining this scenario
further.
