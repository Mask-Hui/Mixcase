This paper aims to propose a novel large-signal order reduction (LSOR)
approach for microgrids (MG) by embedding a stability and accuracy assessment
theorem. Different from the existing order reduction methods, the proposed
approach prevails mainly in two aspects. Firstly, the dynamic stability of
full-order MG models can be assessed by only leveraging their derived
reduced-order models and boundary layer models with our method. Specially, when
the reduced-order system is input-to-state stable and the boundary layer system
is uniformly globally asymptotically stable, the original MGs system can be
proved to be stable under several common growth conditions. Secondly, a set of
accuracy assessment criterion is developed and embedded into a tailored
feedback mechanism to guarantee the accuracy of derived reduced model. It is
proved that the errors between solutions of reduced and original models are
bounded and convergent under such conditions. Strict mathematical proof for the
proposed stability and accuracy assessment theorem is provided. The proposed
LSOR method is generic and can be applied to arbitrary dynamic systems.
Multiple case studies are conducted on MG systems to show the effectiveness of
proposed approach.
