We give a very simple derivation of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer (APS) index
theorem and its small generalization by using the path integral of massless
Dirac fermions. It is based on the Fujikawa's argument for the relation between
the axial anomaly and the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, and only a minor
modification of that argument is sufficient to show the APS index theorem. The
key ingredient is the identification of the APS boundary condition and its
generalization as physical state vectors in the Hilbert space of the massless
fermion theory. The APS $\eta$-invariant appears as the axial charge of the
physical states.
