We present proof-of-concept imaging measurements of a polycrystalline material that integrate the elements of conventional high-energy x-ray diffraction microscopy with coherent diffraction imaging techniques, and that can enable in-situ strain-sensitive imaging of lattice structure in ensembles of deeply embedded crystals over five decades of length scale upon full realization. Such multi-scale imaging capabilities are critical to addressing important questions in a variety of research areas such as materials science and engineering, chemistry, and solid state physics. Towards this eventual goal, the following key aspects are demonstrated: 1) high-energy bragg coherent diffraction imaging (he-bcdi) of sub-micron-scale crystallites at 52 kev at current third-generation synchrotron light sources, 2) he-bcdi performed in conjunction with far-field high-energy diffraction microscopy (ff-hedm) on the grains of a polycrystalline sample in an smoothly integrated manner, and 3) the orientation information of an ensemble of grains obtained via ff-hedm used to perform complementary he-bcdi on multiple bragg reflections of a single targeted grain. These steps lay the foundation for integration of he-bcdi, which typically provides a spatial resolution tens of nanometers, into a broad suite of well-established hedm methods, extending hedm beyond the few-micrometer resolution bound and into the nanoscale, and positioning the approach to take full advantage of the orders-of-magnitude improvement of x-ray coherence expected at fourth generation light sources presently being built and commissioned worldwide.
