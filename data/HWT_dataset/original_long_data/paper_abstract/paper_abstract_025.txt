A proposal on determination of the effective electro-weak mixing angle ${\rm sin^2\theta_{eff}^f\;(f=c,b)}$ at a super z-factory (an $e^+e^-$ collider designed with the possible highest luminosity and running around the center mass energy $\sqrt s=m_z$) is proposed. It is to determine how the effective mixing angles depend on the flavors, especially the flavors $c$, $b$ (with the determined effective ones, the electro-weak mixing angles ${\rm sin^2\theta_w^f\;(f=c,b)}$ of standard model can be derived out precisely). The key point of the proposal is that at such a super z-factory, via measuring the forward-backward ($a_{fb}$), left-right ($a_{lr}$) and combined left-right forward-backward ($a^{fb}_{lr}$) asymmetries of the produced doubly heavy-flavored hadrons (such as $b_c$, $b_c^*$ and the baryons $h_{qq'q}$: $\xi_{cc}$, $\xi_{bc}$ and $\xi_{bb}$ etc) in the relevant production processes $e^+e^-\to b_c+\cdots$ and $e^+e^-\to h_{qq'q}+\cdots$ one may complement the final determination of the mixing angle ${\rm sin^2\theta_w^f\;(f=c,b)}$ of standard model. The advantage of the proposed way to determine the effective electro-weak mixing angles is that the doubly heavy flavor(s) and the out-going direction of the produced doubly-heavy hadron can be experimental determined precisely, i.e. There are no such errors caused by missing identification of the heavy flavor(s) and by determining the so-called thrust axis of the produced jets, which can not be avoided in the early determination at lep-i and slc.
