Thomas-whitehead (tw) gravity is a projectively invariant model of gravity over a d-dimensional manifold that is intimately related to string theory through reparameterization invariance. Unparameterized geodesics are the ubiquitous structure that ties together string theory and higher dimensional gravitation. This is realized through the projective geometry of tracy thomas. The projective connection, due to thomas and later whitehead, admits a component that in one dimension is in one-to-one correspondence with the coadjoint elements of the virasoro algebra. This component is called the diffeomorphism field $\mathcal{d}_{ab }$ in the literature. It also has been shown that in four dimensions, the tw\ action collapses to the einstein-hilbert action with cosmological constant when $\mathcal{d}_{ab}$ is proportional to the einstein metric. These previous results have been restricted to either particular metrics, such as the polyakov 2d\ metric, or were restricted to coordinates that were volume preserving. In this paper, we review tw gravity and derive the gauge invariant tw action that is explicitly projectively invariant and general coordinate invariant. We derive the covariant field equations for the tw action and show how fermionic fields couple to the gauge invariant theory. The independent fields are the metric tensor $g_{ab}$, the fundamental projective invariant $\pi^{a}_{\,\,\,bc}$, and the diffeomorphism field $\mathcal d_{ab}$.
