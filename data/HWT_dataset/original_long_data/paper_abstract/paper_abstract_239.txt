We introduce a theory for the development of a transitional column density $\sigma_{\rm tp}$ between the lognormal and the power-law forms of the probability distribution function (pdf) in a molecular cloud. Our turbulent magnetohydrodynamic simulations show that the value of $\sigma_{\rm tp}$ increases as the strength of both the initial magnetic field and turbulence increases. We develop an analytic expression for $\sigma_{\rm tp}$ based on the interplay of turbulence, a (strong) magnetic field, and gravity. The transition value $\sigma_{\rm tp}$ scales with $\mathcal{m}^2_{\rm 0}$, the square of the initial sonic mach number, and $\beta_{0}$, the initial ratio of gas pressure to magnetic pressure. We fit the variation of $\sigma_{\rm tp}$ among different model clouds as a function of $\mathcal{m}^2_{\rm 0} \beta_{0}$, or equivalently the square of the initial alfv\'enic mach number $\mathcal{m}^2_{\rm a0}$. This implies that the transition value $\sigma_{\rm tp}$ is an imprint of cloud initial conditions and is set by turbulent compression of a magnetic cloud. Physically, the value of $\sigma_{\rm tp}$ denotes the boundary above which the mass-to-flux ratio becomes supercritical and gravity drives the evolution.
