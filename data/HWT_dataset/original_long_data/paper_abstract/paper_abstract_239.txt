We introduce a theory for the development of a transitional column density
$\Sigma_{\rm TP}$ between the lognormal and the power-law forms of the
probability distribution function (PDF) in a molecular cloud. Our turbulent
magnetohydrodynamic simulations show that the value of $\Sigma_{\rm TP}$
increases as the strength of both the initial magnetic field and turbulence
increases. We develop an analytic expression for $\Sigma_{\rm TP}$ based on the
interplay of turbulence, a (strong) magnetic field, and gravity. The transition
value $\Sigma_{\rm TP}$ scales with $\mathcal{M}^2_{\rm 0}$, the square of the
initial sonic Mach number, and $\beta_{0}$, the initial ratio of gas pressure
to magnetic pressure. We fit the variation of $\Sigma_{\rm TP}$ among different
model clouds as a function of $\mathcal{M}^2_{\rm 0} \beta_{0}$, or
equivalently the square of the initial Alfv\'enic Mach number
$\mathcal{M}^2_{\rm A0}$. This implies that the transition value $\Sigma_{\rm
TP}$ is an imprint of cloud initial conditions and is set by turbulent
compression of a magnetic cloud. Physically, the value of $\Sigma_{\rm TP}$
denotes the boundary above which the mass-to-flux ratio becomes supercritical
and gravity drives the evolution.
