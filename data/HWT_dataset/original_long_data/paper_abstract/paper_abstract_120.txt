One of the key tasks in grating based x-ray phase contrast imaging is to
accurately retrieve local phase gradients of a sample from measured intensity
fringe shifts. To fulfill this task in dual phase grating interferometry, one
needs to know the exact mathematical relationship between the two. In this
work, using intuitive analysis of the sample-generated fringe shifts based on
the beat pattern formation mechanism, the authors derived the formulas relating
sample's phase gradients to fringe phase shifts. These formulas provide also a
design optimization tool for dual phase grating interferometry.
