Recent work has shown that two-dimensional non-linear $\sigma$-models on
group manifolds with Poisson-Lie symmetry can be understood within generalised
geometry as exemplars of generalised parallelisable spaces. Here we extend this
idea to target spaces constructed as double cosets $M=\widetilde{G} \backslash
D / H$. Mirroring conventional coset geometries, we show that on $M$ one can
construct a generalised frame field and a $H$-valued generalised spin
connection that together furnish an algebra under the generalised Lie
derivative. This results naturally in a generalised covariant derivative with a
(covariantly) constant generalised intrinsic torsion, lending itself to the
construction of consistent truncations of 10-dimensional supergravity
compactified on $M$. An important feature is that $M$ can admit distinguished
points, around which the generalised tangent bundle should be augmented by
localised vector multiplets. We illustrate these ideas with explicit examples
of two-dimensional parafermionic theories and NS5-branes on a circle.
