We study the three-body decay of the newly observed bottom baryon
$\Lambda_b^*(6072)$ by LHCb; $\Lambda_b^*(6072) \to \Lambda_b \pi \pi$. Its
mass about 500 MeV above the ground state $\Lambda_b$ and a broad width imply
that the state could be an analogue of the Roper resonance of the nucleon
$N(1440)$. In terms of sequential processes going through $\Sigma_b$ and
$\Sigma_b^*$, we find that the observed invariant mass distribution is
reproduced assuming its spin and parity $J^P = 1/2^+$. We discuss that the
ratio of the two sequential processes and angular correlation of two pions are
useful for the determination of spin and parity. We suggest further studies for
the Roper resonance analogue in various flavor contents, raising an interesting
and important question in baryon spectroscopy.
