Narrow linewidth optical atomic transitions provide a valuable resource for
frequency metrology, and form the basis of today's most precise and accurate
clocks. Recent experiments have demonstrated that ensembles of atoms can be
interfaced with the mode of an optical cavity using such transitions, and that
atom-cavity interactions can dominate over decoherence processes even when the
atomic transition that mediates the interactions is very weak. This scenario
enables new opportunities for optical frequency metrology, including techniques
for nondestructive readout and entanglement enhancement for optical lattice
clocks, methods for cavity-enhanced laser frequency stabilization, and
high-precision active optical frequency references based on superradiant
emission. This tutorial provides a pedagogical description of the physics
governing atom-cavity coupling with narrow linewidth optical transitions, and
describes several examples of applications to optical frequency metrology.
