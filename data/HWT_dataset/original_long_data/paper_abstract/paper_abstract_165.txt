We investigate saturation effects in $ep$ scattering as well as in ultraperipheral $p$a and aa collisions at small $x$ with four variants of the impact parameter dependent color dipole model: with and without gluon saturation and with and without a novel mechanism that suppresses unphysical dipole radii above the confinement scale, a problem not addressed by most implementations. We show that $ep$ scattering at hera can be very well described by any of the four variants. When going from $ep$ to $e$a scattering, saturation effects are expected to increase as $\sim$a$^{1/3}$. In lieu of an electron-ion collider, we confront the different versions of the dipole model with data recorded in ultraperipheral collisions at the lhc in order to estimate the sensitivity of the data to gluon saturation in the target nuclei. We find that ultraperipheral pbpb collisions indicate strong saturation effects while $p$pb collisions turn out to not have any discriminating power to distinguish saturation from non-saturation scenarios.
