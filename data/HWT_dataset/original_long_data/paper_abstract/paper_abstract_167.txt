The observation of gravitational waves from an asymmetric binary opens the
possibility for heavy neutron stars, but these pose challenges to models of the
neutron star equation of state. We construct heavy neutron stars by introducing
non-trivial structure in the speed of sound sourced by deconfined QCD matter,
which cannot be well recovered by spectral representations. Their moment of
inertia, Love number and quadrupole moment are very small, so a tenfold
increase in sensitivity may be needed to test this possibility with
gravitational waves, which is feasible with third generation detectors.
