The tails of diboson production at the LHC are sensitive to the interference
between Standard Model and higher dimension operators parameterizing the
effects of heavy new physics. However, helicity selection rules for the diboson
scattering amplitudes set an obstruction to the na\"ive interference
contributions of dimension six operators, causing the total diboson rate
correction's leading contribution to cancel. In this case, carefully measuring
the azimuthal decay angles "resurrects" the interference, recouping sensitivity
to the "non-interfering" operators. We explore these signatures in detail, and
find that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators
are uniquely well-suppressed by the construction of an asymmetry variable which
is only generated by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of
higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical
errors in this observable. We perform a complete analysis of this azimuthal
interference pattern in hadronic decays of W bosons using jet substructure
techniques to tag the bosons and measure their azimuthal decay angles. This
technique provides a valuable cross-check to purely-leptonic measurements of
interference resurrection in diboson production.
