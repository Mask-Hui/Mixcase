Metal ion implantation into ceramics has been demonstrated to be an effective and controllable technique for tailoring the surface electrical conductivity of the ceramic piece, and this approach has been used in a number of applications. Importantly, it provides a method for grading the voltage drop across high voltage insulators, and thereby increasing the maximum operational voltage that can be applied across the insulator without surface flashover. However a concern for the use of the method is the long term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, this especially so if the implanted metal species is readily oxidized. Here we report on our examination of the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina. The results indicate that after an initial drop of as much as 40% in the first few weeks after implantation, the conductivity shows only a very slow decrease of about 10% over the following year. This degree of change should be quite sufficiently small to be unimportant for all but the most demanding situations.
