We have estimated centrality variation of chemical freeze-out parameters from
yield data at mid-rapidity of $\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$ and $p$, $\bar{p}$ for
collision energies of RHIC (Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider), Beam Energy Scan
(RHIC-BES) program, and LHC (Large Hadron Collider). We have considered a
simple hadron resonance gas model and employed a formalism involving conserved
charges ($B, Q, S$) of QCD for parameterization. Along with temperature and
three chemical potentials ($T,\mu_B,\mu_Q,\mu_S$), a strangeness
under-saturation factor ($\gamma_S$) has been used to incorporate the partial
equilibration in the strange sector. Our obtained freeze-out temperature does
not vary much with centrality, whereas chemical potentials and $\gamma_S$ seem
to have a significant dependence. The strange hadrons are found to deviate from
a complete chemical equilibrium at freeze-out at the peripheral collisions.
This deviation appears to be more prominent as the collision energy decreases
at lower RHIC-BES energies. We have also shown that this departure from
equilibrium reduces towards central collisions, and strange particle
equilibration may happen after a threshold number of participants in $A$-$A$
collision.
