We have estimated centrality variation of chemical freeze-out parameters from yield data at mid-rapidity of $\pi^\pm$, $k^\pm$ and $p$, $\bar{p}$ for collision energies of rhic (relativistic heavy ion collider), beam energy scan (rhic-bes) program, and lhc (large hadron collider). We have considered a simple hadron resonance gas model and employed a formalism involving conserved charges ($b, q, s$) of qcd for parameterization. Along with temperature and three chemical potentials ($t,\mu_b,\mu_q,\mu_s$), a strangeness under-saturation factor ($\gamma_s$) has been used to incorporate the partial equilibration in the strange sector. Our obtained freeze-out temperature does not vary much with centrality, whereas chemical potentials and $\gamma_s$ seem to have a significant dependence. The strange hadrons are found to deviate from a complete chemical equilibrium at freeze-out at the peripheral collisions. This deviation appears to be more prominent as the collision energy decreases at lower rhic-bes energies. We have also shown that this departure from equilibrium reduces towards central collisions, and strange particle equilibration may happen after a threshold number of participants in $a$-$a$ collision.
