Neumann-Rosochatius system is a well known one dimensional integrable system.
We study the rotating and pulsating string in $AdS_4 \times \mathbb{CP}^3$ with
a $B_{\rm{NS}}$ holonomy turned on over $\mathbb{CP}^1 \subset \mathbb{CP}^3$,
or the so called Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis (ABJ) background. We observe that the
string equations of motion in both cases are integrable and the Lagrangians
reduce to a form similar to that of deformed Neuman-Rosochatius system. We find
out the scaling relations among various conserved charges and comment on the
finite size effect for the dyonic giant magnons on $R_{t}\times
\mathbb{CP}^{3}$ with two angular momenta. For the pulsating string we derive
the energy as function of oscillation number and angular momenta along
$\mathbb{CP}^{3}$.
