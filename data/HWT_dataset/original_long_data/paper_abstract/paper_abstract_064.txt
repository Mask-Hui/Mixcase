The CHY formalism for massless scattering provides a cohesive framework for
the computation of scattering amplitudes in a variety of theories. It is
especially compelling because it elucidates existing relations among theories
which are seemingly unrelated in a standard Lagrangian formulation. However, it
entails operations that are highly non-trivial to perform analytically, most
notably solving the scattering equations. We present a new Python package (
https://github.com/GDeLaurentis/seampy ) to solve the scattering equations and
to compute scattering amplitudes. Both operations are done numerically with
high-precision floating-point algebra. Elimination theory is used to obtain
solutions to the scattering equations for arbitrary kinematics. These solutions
are then applied to a variety of CHY integrands to obtain tree amplitudes for
the following theories: Yang-Mills, Einstein gravity, biadjoint scalar,
Born-Infeld, non-linear sigma model, Galileon, conformal gravity and
$(\text{DF})^2$. Finally, we exploit this high-precision numerical
implementation to explore the singularity structure of the amplitudes and to
reconstruct analytical expressions which make manifest their pole structure.
Some of the expressions for conformal gravity and the $(\text{DF})^2$ gauge
theory are new to the best of our knowledge.
