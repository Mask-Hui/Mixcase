In this paper, we present an algorithm for online 3d reconstruction of dynamic scenes using individual times of arrival (toa) of photons recorded by single-photon detector arrays. One of the main challenges in 3d imaging using single-photon lidar is the integration time required to build toa histograms and reconstruct reliable 3d profiles in the presence of non-negligible ambient illumination. This long integration time also prevents the analysis of rapid dynamic scenes using existing techniques. We propose a new method which does not rely on the construction of toa histograms but allows, for the first time, individual detection events to be processed online, in a parallel manner in different pixels, while accounting for the intrinsic spatiotemporal structure of dynamic scenes. Adopting a bayesian approach, a bayesian model is constructed to capture the dynamics of the 3d profile and an approximate inference scheme based on assumed density filtering is proposed, yielding a fast and robust reconstruction algorithm able to process efficiently thousands to millions of frames, as usually recorded using single-photon detectors. The performance of the proposed method, able to process hundreds of frames per second, is assessed using a series of experiments conducted with static and dynamic 3d scenes and the results obtained pave the way to a new family of real-time 3d reconstruction solutions.
