In this paper, we present an algorithm for online 3D reconstruction of
dynamic scenes using individual times of arrival (ToA) of photons recorded by
single-photon detector arrays. One of the main challenges in 3D imaging using
single-photon Lidar is the integration time required to build ToA histograms
and reconstruct reliable 3D profiles in the presence of non-negligible ambient
illumination. This long integration time also prevents the analysis of rapid
dynamic scenes using existing techniques. We propose a new method which does
not rely on the construction of ToA histograms but allows, for the first time,
individual detection events to be processed online, in a parallel manner in
different pixels, while accounting for the intrinsic spatiotemporal structure
of dynamic scenes. Adopting a Bayesian approach, a Bayesian model is
constructed to capture the dynamics of the 3D profile and an approximate
inference scheme based on assumed density filtering is proposed, yielding a
fast and robust reconstruction algorithm able to process efficiently thousands
to millions of frames, as usually recorded using single-photon detectors. The
performance of the proposed method, able to process hundreds of frames per
second, is assessed using a series of experiments conducted with static and
dynamic 3D scenes and the results obtained pave the way to a new family of
real-time 3D reconstruction solutions.
