We advance a holographic construction for the entanglement negativity of bipartite mixed state configurations of two disjoint intervals in $(1+1)$ dimensional conformal field theories ($cft_{1+1}$) through the $ads_3/cft_2$ correspondence. Our construction constitutes the large central charge analysis of the entanglement negativity for mixed states under consideration and involves a specific algebraic sum of bulk space like geodesics anchored on appropriate intervals in the dual $cft_{1+1}$. The construction is utilized to compute the holographic entanglement negativity for such mixed states in $cft_{1+1}$s dual to bulk pure $ads_3$ geometries and btz black holes respectively. Our analysis exactly reproduces the universal features of corresponding replica technique results in the large central charge limit which serves as a consistency check.
