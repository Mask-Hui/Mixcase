In a network, a channel introduces correlations to the parties that aim to establish a communication protocol. In this work, we present a framework of non-local network coding by exploiting a bell scenario and show the usefulness of non-local and quantum resources in network coding. Two-sender and two-receiver interference channels are considered, for which network coding is characterized by two-input and four-outcome bell scenarios. It is shown that non-signaling (quantum) correlations lead to strictly higher channel capacities in general than quantum (local) correlations. It is also shown that, however, more non-locality does not necessarily imply a higher channel capacity. The framework can be generally applied to network communication protocols.
