We aim to investigate the infrared regime in the effective theory of the new
quadratic gauge in the physical compact space by defining it on 4-sphere.
Abelian dominance is characterized by off-diagonal gluons acquiring dynamical
masses and it hints at existence of confinement. We do observe Abelian
dominance in the ghost condensed vacuum of this theory on 4-sphere. Along with
this observation, we find an unusual result that mass of an off-diagonal gluon
on 4-sphere is position dependent in this theory as a consequence of the curved
geometry. This suggests that the curvature of 4-sphere does not change the
infrared behaviour of present theory on 4-sphere from that of the theory with
quadratic gauge in Euclidean spacetime as Abelian dominance is observed in
Euclidean spacetime too while it has caused mass of an off-diagonal gluon on
4-sphere to be position dependent. The effective action in the confined phase
on 4-sphere and that in the 4-dim Euclidean space are found to be identical in
a profound outcome.
