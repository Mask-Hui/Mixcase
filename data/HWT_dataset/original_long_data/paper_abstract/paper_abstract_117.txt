Gauge-invariant descriptions for a free bosonic scalar field of continuous spin in a $d$-dimensional minkowski space-time using a metric-like formulation are constructed on the basis of a constrained brst-bfv approach we propose. The resulting brst-bfv equations of motion for a scalar field augmented by ghost operators contains different sets of auxiliary fields, depending on the manner of a partial gauge-fixing and a resolution of some of the equations of motion for a brst-unfolded first-stage reducible gauge theory. To achieve an equivalence of the resulting brst-unfolded constrained equations of motion with the initial irreducible poincare group conditions of a bargmann--wigner type, it is demonstrated that one should replace the field in these conditions by a class of gauge-equivalent configurations. Triplet-like, doublet-like constrained descriptions, as well as an unconstrained quartet-like non-lagrangian and lagrangian formulations, are derived using both fronsdal-like and new tensor fields. In particular, the brst--bv equations of motion and lagrangian using an appropriate set of lagrangian multipliers in the minimal sector of the respective field and antifield configurations are constructed in a manifest way.
