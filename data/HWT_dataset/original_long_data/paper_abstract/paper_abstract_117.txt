Gauge-invariant descriptions for a free bosonic scalar field of continuous
spin in a $d$-dimensional Minkowski space-time using a metric-like formulation
are constructed on the basis of a constrained BRST-BFV approach we propose. The
resulting BRST-BFV equations of motion for a scalar field augmented by ghost
operators contains different sets of auxiliary fields, depending on the manner
of a partial gauge-fixing and a resolution of some of the equations of motion
for a BRST-unfolded first-stage reducible gauge theory. To achieve an
equivalence of the resulting BRST-unfolded constrained equations of motion with
the initial irreducible Poincare group conditions of a Bargmann--Wigner type,
it is demonstrated that one should replace the field in these conditions by a
class of gauge-equivalent configurations. Triplet-like, doublet-like
constrained descriptions, as well as an unconstrained quartet-like
non-Lagrangian and Lagrangian formulations, are derived using both
Fronsdal-like and new tensor fields. In particular, the BRST--BV equations of
motion and Lagrangian using an appropriate set of Lagrangian multipliers in the
minimal sector of the respective field and antifield configurations are
constructed in a manifest way.
