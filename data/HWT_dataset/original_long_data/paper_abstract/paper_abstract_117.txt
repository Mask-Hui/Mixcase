We examine the detection prospects for a long-lived bi$\nu$o, a pseudo-Dirac
bino which is responsible for neutrino masses, at the LHC and at dedicated
long-lived particle detectors. The bi$\nu$o arises in $U(1)_R$-symmetric
supersymmetric models where the neutrino masses are generated through higher
dimensional operators in an inverse seesaw mechanism. At the LHC the bi$\nu$o
is produced through squark decays and it subsequently decays to quarks, charged
leptons and missing energy via its mixing with the Standard Model neutrinos. We
consider long-lived bi$\nu$os which escape the ATLAS or CMS detectors as
missing energy and decay to charged leptons inside the proposed long-lived
particle detectors FASER, CODEX-b, and MATHUSLA. We find the currently allowed
region in the squark-bi$\nu$o mass parameter space by recasting most recent LHC
searches for jets+MET. We also determine the reach of MATHUSLA, CODEX-b and
FASER. We find that a large region of parameter space involving squark masses,
bi$\nu$o mass and the messenger scale can be probed with MATHUSLA, ranging from
bi$\nu$o masses of 10 GeV-2 TeV and messenger scales $10^{2-11}$ TeV for a
range of squark masses.
