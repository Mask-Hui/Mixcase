We derive the conditions for matching high-energy renormalizable Quantum
Field Theories onto low-energy nonrenormalizable ones by means of the FDR
approach described in Fortsch.Phys. 63 (2015) 132-141. Our procedure works
order-by-order in the loop expansion and avoids the addition of higher
dimensional interactions into the nonrenormalizable Lagrangian. To illustrate
our strategy, we match the high-energy fermion-loop corrections computed in the
complete electroweak theory onto the nonrenormalizable four-fermion Fermi
model. As a result, the Fermi Lagrangian can be used without modifications to
reproduce, at arbitrary loop orders and energies, the exact electroweak
interactions between two massless fermion lines induced by one-fermion-loop
resummed gauge boson propagators.
