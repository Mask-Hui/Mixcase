We establish a robust statistical description of the star-forming galaxy population at the end of cosmic hi reionization ($5.0\le{}z\le6.6$) from a large sample of 52 galaxies with spectroscopically confirmed redshifts from the vimos ultradeep survey. We identify galaxies with ly$\alpha$ either in absorption or in emission, at variance with most spectroscopic samples in the literature where ly$\alpha$ emitters dominate. We find that star-forming galaxies at these redshifts are distributed along a main sequence in the stellar mass vs. Sfr plane. We report a flat evolution of the ssfr(z) in 3<z<6 compared to lower redshift measurements. Uv-continuum slopes vary with luminosity, with a large dispersion. We determing uv and ly$\alpha$ luminosity functions using v$_{max}$ method and use them to derive star formation rate densities (sfrd). We find that both uv-derived and ly$\alpha$-derived sfrds are in excellent agreement after correcting ly$\alpha$ luminosity density for igm absorption. Our new sfrd measurements at a mean redshift z=5.6 confirm the steep decline of the sfrd at z>2. The bright end of the ly$\alpha$ luminosity function has a high number density, indicating a significant star formation activity concentrated in the brightest ly$\alpha$ emitters (lae) at these redshifts. Lae with ew>25\aa ~contribute to about 75\% of the total uv-derived sfrd. While our analysis favors a low dust content in 5.0<z<6.6, uncertainties on the dust extinction correction and associated degeneracies in spectral fitting will remain an issue to estimate the total sfrd until future survey extending spectroscopy to the nir rest-frame spectral domain, e.g. With jwst.
