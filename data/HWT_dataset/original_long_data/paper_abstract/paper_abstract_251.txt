Given a simple undirected graph $G$, an orientation of $G$ is to assign every
edge of $G$ a direction. Borradaile et al gave a greedy algorithm
SC-Path-Reversal (in polynomial time) which finds a strongly connected
orientation that minimizes the maximum indegree, and conjectured that
SC-Path-Reversal is indeed optimal for the "minimizing the lexicographic order"
objective as well. In this note, we give a positive answer to the conjecture,
that is we show that the algorithm SC-PATH-REVERSAL finds a strongly connected
orientation that minimizes the lexicographic order of indegrees.
