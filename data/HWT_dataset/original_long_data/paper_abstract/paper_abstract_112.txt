We consider the connection between two constructions of the mirror partner
for the Calabi-Yau orbifold. This orbifold is defined as a quotient by some
suitable subgroup $G$ of the phase symmetries of the hypersurface $ X_M $ in
the weighted projective space, cut out by a quasi-homogeneous polynomial $W_M$.
The first, Berglund-H\"ubsch-Krawitz (BHK) construction, uses another weighted
projective space and the quotient of a new hypersurface $X_{M^T}$ inside it by
some dual group $G^T$. In the second, Batyrev construction, the mirror partner
is constructed as a hypersurface in the toric variety defined by the reflexive
polytope dual to the polytope associated with the original Calabi-Yau orbifold.
We give a simple evidence of the equivalence of these two constructions.
