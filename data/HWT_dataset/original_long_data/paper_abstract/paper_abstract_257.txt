We compute the one-loop effective action of string configurations embedded in $ads_4\times\mathbb{cp}^3$ which are dual to $\frac{1}{6}$-bps latitude wilson loops in the abjm theory. To avoid ambiguities in the string path integral we subtract the $\frac{1}{2}$-bps case. The one-loop determinants are computed by fourier-decomposing the two dimensional operators and then using the gel'fand-yaglom method. We comment on various aspects related to the regularization procedure, showing the cancellation of a hierarchy of divergences. After taking into account an ir anomaly from a change in topology, we find a precise agreement with the field theory result known from supersymmetric localization.
