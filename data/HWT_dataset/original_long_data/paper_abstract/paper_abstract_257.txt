We compute the one-loop effective action of string configurations embedded in
$AdS_4\times\mathbb{CP}^3$ which are dual to $\frac{1}{6}$-BPS latitude Wilson
Loops in the ABJM theory. To avoid ambiguities in the string path integral we
subtract the $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS case. The one-loop determinants are computed by
Fourier-decomposing the two dimensional operators and then using the
Gel'fand-Yaglom method. We comment on various aspects related to the
regularization procedure, showing the cancellation of a hierarchy of
divergences. After taking into account an IR anomaly from a change in topology,
we find a precise agreement with the field theory result known from
supersymmetric localization.
