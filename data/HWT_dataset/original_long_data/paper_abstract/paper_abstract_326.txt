The singlet sector of vector, large $N$, 3d field theory corresponds to
Vasiliev higher spin theory on $AdS_4$. Will discuss three dimensional $U(N)$
symmetric field theory with fermion and boson matter coupled to a topological
Chern-Simons field. In the presence of a marginal deformation will determine
the conditions for the existence of a phase with spontaneous breaking of scale
invariance. In this phase the ground state contains massive $U(N)$ quanta and a
massless $U(N)$ singlet bound state goldstone boson:~the Dilaton. Will show
that such a phase appears only in the presence of a marginal deformation. The
massless Dilaton appears in the spectrum provided certain relations between
coupling constants are satisfied. Will discuss the fermion-boson mapping and
show that the conditions for spontaneous breaking of scale invariance in the
boson and fermion theories are copies of each other.
