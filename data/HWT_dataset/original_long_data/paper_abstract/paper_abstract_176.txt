It is known that invariance and equivariance properties for systems on lie groups can be exploited in the design of high performance and robust observers and filters for real-world robotic systems. This paper proposes an analysis framework that allows any kinematic system on a lie group to be embedded in a natural manner into an equivariant kinematic system. This framework allows us to characterise the properties of, and relationships between, invariant systems, group affine systems, and equivariant systems. We propose a new filter design, the equivariant filter (eqf), that exploits the equivariance properties of the system embedding and can be applied to any kinematic system on a lie group.
