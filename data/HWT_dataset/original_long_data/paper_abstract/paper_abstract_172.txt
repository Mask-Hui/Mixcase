The oldest and most robust technique to search for new particles is to look
for `bumps' in invariant mass spectra over smoothly falling backgrounds. We
present a new extension of the bump hunt that naturally benefits from modern
machine learning algorithms while remaining model-agnostic. This approach is
based on the Classification Without Labels (CWoLa) method where the invariant
mass is used to create two potentially mixed samples, one with little or no
signal and one with a potential resonance. Additional features that are
uncorrelated with the invariant mass can be used for training the classifier.
Given the lack of new physics signals at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), such
model-agnostic approaches are critical for ensuring full coverage to fully
exploit the rich datasets from the LHC experiments. In addition to illustrating
how the new method works in simple test cases, we demonstrate the power of the
extended bump hunt on a realistic all-hadronic resonance search in a channel
that would not be covered with existing techniques.
