Understanding how strongly correlated two-dimensional (2D) systems can give
rise to unconventional superconductivity with high critical temperatures is one
of the major unsolved problems in condensed matter physics. Ultracold 2D Fermi
gases have emerged as clean and controllable model systems to study the
interplay of strong correlations and reduced dimensionality, but direct
evidence of superfluidity in these systems has been missing. Here, we
demonstrate superfluidity in an ultracold 2D Fermi gas by moving a periodic
potential through the system and observing no dissipation below a critical
velocity v$_{\rm c}$. We measure v$_{\rm c}$ as a function of interaction
strength and find a maximum in the crossover regime between bosonic and
fermionic superfluidity. Our measurement establishes ultracold Fermi gases as a
powerful tool for studying the influence of reduced dimensionality on strongly
correlated superfluids.
