Rydberg helium atoms traveling in pulsed supersonic beams have been coupled to microwave fields in a superconducting coplanar waveguide (cpw) resonator. The atoms were initially prepared in the 1s55s $^3$s$_1$ rydberg level by two-color two-photon laser excitation from the metastable 1s2s $^3$s$_1$ level. Two-photon microwave transitions between the 1s55s $^3$s$_1$ and 1s56s $^3$s$_1$ levels were then driven by the 19.556 ghz third-harmonic microwave field in a quarter-wave cpw resonator. This superconducting microwave resonator was fabricated from niobium nitride on a silicon substrate and operated at temperatures between 3.65 and 4.30 k. The populations of the rydberg levels in the experiments were determined by state-selective pulsed electric field ionization. The coherence of the atom-resonator coupling was studied by time-domain measurements of rabi oscillations.
