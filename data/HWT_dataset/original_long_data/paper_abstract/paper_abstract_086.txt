Rydberg helium atoms traveling in pulsed supersonic beams have been coupled
to microwave fields in a superconducting coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonator.
The atoms were initially prepared in the 1s55s $^3$S$_1$ Rydberg level by
two-color two-photon laser excitation from the metastable 1s2s $^3$S$_1$ level.
Two-photon microwave transitions between the 1s55s $^3$S$_1$ and 1s56s
$^3$S$_1$ levels were then driven by the 19.556 GHz third-harmonic microwave
field in a quarter-wave CPW resonator. This superconducting microwave resonator
was fabricated from niobium nitride on a silicon substrate and operated at
temperatures between 3.65 and 4.30 K. The populations of the Rydberg levels in
the experiments were determined by state-selective pulsed electric field
ionization. The coherence of the atom-resonator coupling was studied by
time-domain measurements of Rabi oscillations.
