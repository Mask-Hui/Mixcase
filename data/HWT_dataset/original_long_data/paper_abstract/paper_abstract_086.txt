We present the new cteq-tea global analysis of quantum chromodynamics (qcd). In this analysis, parton distribution functions (pdfs) of the nucleon are determined within the hessian method at the next-to-next-to-leading order (nnlo) in perturbative qcd, based on the most recent measurements from the large hadron collider (lhc) and a variety of world collider data. Because of difficulties in fitting both the atlas 7 and 8 tev $w$ and $z$ vector boson production cross section data, we present four families of (n)nlo cteq-tea pdfs, named ct18, a, x and z pdfs, respectively. We study the impact of the ct18 family of pdfs on the theoretical predictions of standard candle cross sections at the lhc.
