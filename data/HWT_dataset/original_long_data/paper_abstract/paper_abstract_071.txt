Authenticated teleportation aims to certify the transmission of a quantum
state through teleportation, even in the presence of an adversary. This
scenario can be pictured in terms of an untrusted source distributing a Bell
state between two parties who wish to verify it using some simple tests. We
propose a protocol that achieves this goal in a practical way, and analyse its
performance and security when the parties have noisy measurement devices.
Further, we model a realistic experimental scenario where the state is subject
to noise and dephasing. We finally apply our analysis to the verification of
graph states with noisy measurement devices.
