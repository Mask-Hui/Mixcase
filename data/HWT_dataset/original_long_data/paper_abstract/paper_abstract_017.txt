Super spirals are the most massive star-forming disk galaxies in the universe (ogle et al. 2016, 2019). We measured rotation curves for 23 massive spirals and find a wide range of fast rotation speeds (240-570 km/s), indicating enclosed dynamical masses of 0.6 - 4e12 msun. Super spirals with mass in stars log mstars / msun > 11.5 break from the baryonic tully-fisher relation (btfr) established for lower mass galaxies. The btfr power-law index breaks from 3.75 +/- 0.11 to 0.25 +/- 0.41 above a rotation speed of 340 km/s. Super spirals also have very high specific angular momenta that break from the fall (1983) relation. These results indicate that super spirals are under-massive for their dark matter halos, limited to a mass in stars of log mstars / msun < 11.8. Most giant elliptical galaxies also obey this fundamental limit, which corresponds to a critical dark halo mass of log mhalo / msun = 12.7. Once a halo reaches this mass, its gas can no longer cool and collapse in a dynamical time. Super spirals survive today in halos as massive as log mhalo / msun = 13.6, continuing to form stars from the cold baryons they captured before their halos reached critical mass. The observed high-mass break in the btfr is inconsistent with the modified newtonian dynamics (mond) theory (bekenstein and milgrom 1984).
