We show that transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (tmdpdfs), important non-perturbative quantities for describing the properties of hadrons in high-energy scattering processes such as drell-yan and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering with observed small transverse momentum, can be obtained from euclidean qcd calculations in the framework of large-momentum effective theory (lamet). We present a lamet factorization of the euclidean quasi-tmdpdfs in terms of the physical tmdpdfs and off-light-cone soft function at leading order in $1/p^z$ expansion, with the perturbative matching coefficient satisfying a renormalization group equation. We also discuss the implementation in lattice qcd with finite-length gauge links as well as the rapidity-regularization-independent factorization for drell-yan cross section.
