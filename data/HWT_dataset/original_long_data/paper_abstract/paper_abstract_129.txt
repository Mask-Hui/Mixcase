The secondary bjerknes force plays a significant role in the evolution of bubble clusters. However, due to the complex dependence of the force on multiple parameters, it is highly non-trivial to include the effects of this force in the simulations of bubble clusters. In this paper, machine learning is used to develop a data-driven model for the secondary bjerknes force between two insonated bubbles as a function of the equilibrium radii of the bubbles, the distance between the bubbles, the amplitude and the frequency of the pressure. The force varies over several orders of magnitude, which poses a serious challenge for the usual machine learning models. To overcome this difficulty, the magnitudes and the signs of the force are separated and modelled separately. A nonlinear regression is obtained with a feed-forward network model for the logarithm of the magnitude, whereas the sign is modelled by a support-vector machine model. The principle, the practical aspects related to the training and validation of the machine models are introduced. The predictions from the models are checked against the values computed from the keller-miksis equations. The results show that the models are extremely efficient while providing accurate estimate of the force. The models make it computationally feasible for the future simulations of the bubble clusters to include the effects of the secondary bjerknes force.
