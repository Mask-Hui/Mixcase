The $\mu$-RWELL is a single-amplification stage resistive Micro-Pattern
Gaseous Detector (MPGD). The detector amplification element is realized with a
single copper-clad polyimide foil micro-patterned with a blind hole (well)
matrix and embedded in the readout PCB through a thin Diamond-Like-Carbon (DLC)
sputtered resistive film. The introduction of the resistive layer, suppressing
the transition from streamer to spark, allows to achieve large gains
($\geq$10$^4$) with a single amplification stage, while partially reducing the
capability to stand high particle fluxes. The simplest resistive layout,
designed for low-rate applications, is based on a single-resistive layer with
edge grounding. At high particle fluxes this layout suffers of a non-uniform
response. In order to get rid of such a limitation different current evacuation
geometries have been designed. In this work we report the study of the
performance of several high rate resistive layouts tested at the CERN H8-SpS
and PSI $\pi$M1 beam test facilities. These layouts fulfill the requirements
for the detectors at the HL-LHC and for the experiments at the next generation
colliders FCC-ee/hh and CepC.
