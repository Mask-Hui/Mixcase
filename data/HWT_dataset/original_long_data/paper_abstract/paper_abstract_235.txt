Classical dynamical systems close to a critical point are known to act as efficient sensors due to a strongly nonlinear response. We explore such systems in the quantum regime by modeling a quantum version of a driven van der pol oscillator. We find the classical response survives down to one excitation quantum. At very weak drives, genuine quantum features arise, including diverging and negative susceptibilities. Further, the linear response is greatly enhanced by using a strong incoherent pump. These results are largely generic and can be probed in current experimental platforms suited for quantum sensing.
