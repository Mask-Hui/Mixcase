For arbitrarily small values of $\varepsilon>0,$ we formulate and analyse the
Maxwell system of equations of electromagnetism on $\varepsilon$-periodic sets
$S^\varepsilon\subset{\mathbb R}^3.$ Assuming that a family of Borel measures
$\mu^\varepsilon,$ such that ${\rm supp}(\mu^\varepsilon)=S^\varepsilon,$ is
obtained by $\varepsilon$-contraction of a fixed 1-periodic measure $\mu,$ and
for right-hand sides $f^\varepsilon\in L^2({\mathbb R}^3, d\mu^\varepsilon),$
we prove order-sharp norm-resolvent convergence estimates for the solutions of
the system. Our analysis includes the case of periodic "singular structures",
when $\mu$ is supported by lower-dimensional manifolds.
