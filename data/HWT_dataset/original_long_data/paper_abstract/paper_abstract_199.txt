Shock electrodialysis is a recently developed electrochemical water treatment
method which shows promise for water deionization and ionic separations.
Although simple models and scaling laws have been proposed, a predictive theory
has not yet emerged to fit experimental data and enable system design. Here, we
extend and analyze existing "leaky membrane" models for the canonical case of a
steady shock in cross flow, as in recent experimental prototypes.
Two-dimensional numerical solutions are compared with analytical boundary-layer
approximations and experimental data. The boundary-layer theory accurately
reproduces the simulation results for desalination, and both models predict the
data collapse of the desalination factor with dimensionless current, scaled to
the incoming convective flux of cations. The numerical simulation also predicts
the water recovery increase with current. Nevertheless, both approaches cannot
quantitatively fit the transition from normal to over-limiting current, which
suggests gaps in our understanding of extreme electrokinetic phenomena in
porous media.
