Au mic is a young, very active m dwarf star with a debris disk and at least one transiting neptune-size planet. Here we present detailed analysis of the magnetic field of au mic based on previously unpublished high-resolution optical and near-infrared spectropolarimetric observations. We report a systematic detection of circular and linear polarization signatures in the stellar photospheric lines. Tentative zeeman doppler imaging modeling of the former data suggests a non-axisymmetric global field with a surface-averaged strength of about 90 g. At the same time, linear polarization observations indicate the presence of a much stronger $\approx$2 kg axisymmetric dipolar field, which contributes no circular polarization signal due to the equator-on orientation of au mic. A separate zeeman broadening and intensification analysis allowed us to determine a mean field modulus of 2.3 and 2.1 kg from the y- and k-band atomic lines respectively. These magnetic field measurements are essential for understanding environmental conditions within the au mic planetary system.
