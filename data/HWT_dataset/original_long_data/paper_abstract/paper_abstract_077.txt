Scintillation from noble gases is an important technique in particle physics
including neutrino beam experiments, neutrino-less double beta-decay and dark
matter searches. In liquid argon, the possibility of enhancing the light yield
by the addition of a small quantity of xenon (doping at 10-1000 ppm) has been
of particular interest. While the pathway for energy transfer between argon and
xenon excimers is well known, the time-dependence of the process has not been
fully studied in the context of a physics-based model. In this paper we present
a model of the energy transfer process together with a fit to xenon-doped argon
data. We have measured the diffusion limited rate constant as a function of
xenon dopant. We find that the time dependence of the energy transfer is
consistent with diffusion-limited reactions. Additionally, we find that
commercially obtained argon can have a small xenon component (4 ppm). Our
result will facilitate the use of xenon-doped liquid argon in future
experiments.
