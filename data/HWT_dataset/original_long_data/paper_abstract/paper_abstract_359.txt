Many natural optimization problems are np-hard, which implies that they are probably hard to solve exactly in the worst-case. However, it suffices to get reasonably good solutions for all (or even most) instances in practice. This paper presents a new algorithm for computing approximate solutions in ${\theta(n})$ for the maximum exact 3-satisfiability (max-e-$3$-sat) problem by using deep learning methodology. This methodology allows us to create a learning algorithm able to fix boolean variables by using local information obtained by the survey propagation algorithm. By performing an accurate analysis, on random cnf instances of the max-e-$3$-sat with several boolean variables, we show that this new algorithm, avoiding any decimation strategy, can build assignments better than a random one, even if the convergence of the messages is not found. Although this algorithm is not competitive with state-of-the-art maximum satisfiability (max-sat) solvers, it can solve substantially larger and more complicated problems than it ever saw during training.
