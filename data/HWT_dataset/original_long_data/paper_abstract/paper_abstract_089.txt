We study the quantum tunnel effect through a potential barrier employing a semiclassical formulation of quantum mechanics based on expectation values of configuration variables and quantum dispersions as dynamical variables. The evolution of the system is given in terms of a dynamical system for which we are able to determine effective trajectories for individual particles, in a total resemblance of the bohmian description of quantum mechanics. We obtain a type of semiclassical confinement for particles in a similar way as with the quantum potential, and also determine a semiclassical transmission coefficient for the tunneling process.
