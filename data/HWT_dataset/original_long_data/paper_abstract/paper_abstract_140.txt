In a molecular scenario, we investigate the isospin-breaking hidden charm
decay processes of $X(3872)$, i.e., $X(3872) \to \pi^+ \pi^- J/\psi$, $X(3872)
\to \pi^+ \pi^- \pi^0 J/\psi$, and $X(3872)\to \pi^0\chi_{cJ}$. We assume that
the source of the strong isospin violation comes from the different coupling
strengths of $X(3872)$ to its charged components $D^{\ast +} D^-$ and neutral
components $D^{\ast 0 } \bar{D}^0$ as well as the interference between the
charged meson loops and neutral meson loops. The former effect could fix our
parameters by using the measurement of the ratio $\Gamma[X(3872) \to \pi^+
\pi^- \pi^0 J/\psi]/\Gamma[X(3872) \to \pi^+ \pi^- J/\psi]$. With the
determined parameter range, we find that the estimated ratio $\Gamma[X(3872)
\to \pi^0 \chi_{c1}/\Gamma[X(3872) \to \pi^+ \pi^- J/\psi]$ is well consistent
with the experimental measurement from the BESIII collaboration. Moreover, the
partial width ratio of $\pi^0 \chi_{cJ}$ for $J=0,1,2$ is estimated to be
$1.77\sim1.65:1:1.09\sim1.43$, which could be tested by further precise
measurements of BESIII and Belle II.
