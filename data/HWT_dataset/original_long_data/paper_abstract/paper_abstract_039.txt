We are studying the influence of stellar multiplicity on exoplanet systems, in particular systems that have been detected via radial-velocity searches. We are in particular interested in the closest companions as they would have a strong influence on the evolution of the original planet forming disks. In this study we present new companions detected during our ongoing survey of exoplanet hosts with vlt/sphere. We are using the extreme adaptive optics imager sphere at the eso/vlt to search for faint (sub)stellar companions. We utilized the classical coronagraphic imaging mode to perform a snapshot survey (3-6 min integration time) of exoplanet host stars in the ks-band. We detected new stellar companions to the exoplanet host stars hd1666, hip68468, hip107773, and hd109271. With an angular separation of only 0.38" (40 au of projected separation) hip107773 is among the closest companions found to exoplanet host stars. The presence of the stellar companion explains the linear radial-velocity trend seen in the system. At such a small separation the companion likely had significant influence on the evolution of the planet forming disk around the primary star. We find that the companion in the hd1666 system may well be responsible for the high orbit eccentricity (0.63) of the detected jupiter class planet, making this system one of only a few where such a connection can be established. A cross-match with the gaia dr2 catalog showed furthermore that the near infrared faint companion around hd109271 had been detected in the optical and is significantly brighter than in the near infrared making it a white dwarf companion.
