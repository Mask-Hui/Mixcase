Our study is focused on the dynamics of weighted composition operators defined on a locally convex space $e\hookrightarrow (c(x),\tau_p)$ with $x$ being a topological hausdorff space containing at least two different points and such that the evaluations $\{\delta_x:\ x\in x\}$ are linearly independent in $e'$. We prove, when $x$ is compact and $e$ is a banach space containing a nowhere vanishing function, that a weighted composition operator $c_{\varphi,\omega}$ is never weakly supercyclic on $e$. We also prove that if the symbol $\varphi$ lies in the unit ball of $a(\mathbb{d})$, then every weighted composition operator can never be $\tau_p$-supercyclic neither on $c(\mathbb{d})$ nor on the disc algebra $a(\mathbb{d})$. Finally, we obtain ansari-bourdon type results and conditions on the spectrum for arbitrary weakly supercyclic operators, and we provide necessary conditions for a composition operator to be weakly supercyclic on the space of holomorphic functions defined in non necessarily simply connected planar domains. As a consequence, we show that no composition operator can be weakly supercyclic neither on the space of holomorphic functions on the punctured disc nor in the punctured plane.
