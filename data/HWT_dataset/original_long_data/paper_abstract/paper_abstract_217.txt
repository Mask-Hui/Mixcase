Sampling is a widely used graph reduction technique to accelerate graph
computations and simplify graph visualizations. By comprehensively analyzing
the literature on graph sampling, we assume that existing algorithms cannot
effectively preserve minority structures that are rare and small in a graph but
are very important in graph analysis. In this work, we initially conduct a
pilot user study to investigate representative minority structures that are
most appealing to human viewers. We then perform an experimental study to
evaluate the performance of existing graph sampling algorithms regarding
minority structure preservation. Results confirm our assumption and suggest key
points for designing a new graph sampling approach named mino-centric graph
sampling (MCGS). In this approach, a triangle-based algorithm and a
cut-point-based algorithm are proposed to efficiently identify minority
structures. A set of importance assessment criteria are designed to guide the
preservation of important minority structures. Three optimization objectives
are introduced into a greedy strategy to balance the preservation between
minority and majority structures and suppress the generation of new minority
structures. A series of experiments and case studies are conducted to evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed MCGS.
