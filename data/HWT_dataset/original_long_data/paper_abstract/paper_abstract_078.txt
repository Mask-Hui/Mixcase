PrCo$_2$Ga$_8$ is an orthorhombic quasi-skutterudite type compound which
crystallizes in the CaCo$_2$Al$_8$ structure type, with space group $Pbam$ (No.
55). The Pr$^{3+}$ ion has a site symmetry of $C_s$ which predicts a crystal
electric field (CEF) level splitting into 9 singlets for $J$ = 4. However, a
phase transition at $T_m$ = 1.28~K is observed in electrical resistivity and
specific heat results and is reported in this paper. The electrical resistivity
shows an upturn below $T_m$ due to the superzone-gap formation. This transition
is tuneable in fields and is suppressed to lower temperatures with applied
magnetic fields. The electronic specific heat $C_{p}(T)/T$ increases below
$T_m$ and reaches a value of 7.37 J/(mol K$^2$) at 0.4~K. The Sommerfeld
coefficient, $\gamma$ extracted from the low temperature analysis of
$C_\mathrm{4f}(T)/T$ is 637 mJ/(mol K$^2$) indicating a possible mass
enhancement of the quasiparticles. The calculated entropy value of 3.05 J/(mol
K) is recovered around $T_m$ exhibiting almost 53% of Rln2, where R is the
universal gas constant. Magnetic susceptibility results obeys the Curie-Weiss
law for data above 100 K with an estimated effective magnetic moment,
$\mu_\mathrm{eff}$ = 3.37 $\mu_B$/Pr and Weiss temperature, $\theta_p$ = $-$124
K.
