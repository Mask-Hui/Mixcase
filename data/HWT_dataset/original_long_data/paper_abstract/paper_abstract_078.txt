Prco$_2$ga$_8$ is an orthorhombic quasi-skutterudite type compound which crystallizes in the caco$_2$al$_8$ structure type, with space group $pbam$ (no. 55). The pr$^{3+}$ ion has a site symmetry of $c_s$ which predicts a crystal electric field (cef) level splitting into 9 singlets for $j$ = 4. However, a phase transition at $t_m$ = 1.28~k is observed in electrical resistivity and specific heat results and is reported in this paper. The electrical resistivity shows an upturn below $t_m$ due to the superzone-gap formation. This transition is tuneable in fields and is suppressed to lower temperatures with applied magnetic fields. The electronic specific heat $c_{p}(t)/t$ increases below $t_m$ and reaches a value of 7.37 j/(mol k$^2$) at 0.4~k. The sommerfeld coefficient, $\gamma$ extracted from the low temperature analysis of $c_\mathrm{4f}(t)/t$ is 637 mj/(mol k$^2$) indicating a possible mass enhancement of the quasiparticles. The calculated entropy value of 3.05 j/(mol k) is recovered around $t_m$ exhibiting almost 53% of rln2, where r is the universal gas constant. Magnetic susceptibility results obeys the curie-weiss law for data above 100 k with an estimated effective magnetic moment, $\mu_\mathrm{eff}$ = 3.37 $\mu_b$/pr and weiss temperature, $\theta_p$ = $-$124 k.
