Consider a Bayesian inference problem where a variable of interest does not
take values in a Euclidean space. These "non-standard" data structures are in
reality fairly common. They are frequently used in problems involving latent
discrete factor models, networks, and domain specific problems such as sequence
alignments and reconstructions, pedigrees, and phylogenies. In principle,
Bayesian inference should be particularly well-suited in such scenarios, as the
Bayesian paradigm provides a principled way to obtain confidence assessment for
random variables of any type. However, much of the recent work on making
Bayesian analysis more accessible and computationally efficient has focused on
inference in Euclidean spaces. In this paper, we introduce Blang, a domain
specific language (DSL) and library aimed at bridging this gap. Blang allows
users to perform Bayesian analysis on arbitrary data types while using a
declarative syntax similar to BUGS. Blang is augmented with intuitive language
additions to invent data types of the user's choosing. To perform inference at
scale on such arbitrary state spaces, Blang leverages recent advances in
parallelizable, non-reversible Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.
