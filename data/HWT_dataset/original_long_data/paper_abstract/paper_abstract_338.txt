Spectra of 76 known dwarf novae from the LAMOST survey were presented. Most
of the objects were observed in quiescence, and about 16 systems have typical
outburst spectra. 36 of these systems were observed by SDSS, and most of their
spectra are similar to the SDSS spectra. 2 objects, V367 Peg and V537 Peg, are
the first to observe their spectra. The spectrum of V367 Peg shows a
contribution from a M-type donor and its spectral type could be estimated as
M3-5 by combining its orbital period. The signature of white dwarf spectrum can
be seen clearly in four low-accretion-rate WZ Sge stars. Other special spectral
features worthy of further observations are also noted and discussed. We
present a LAMOST spectral atlas of outbursting dwarf novae. 6 objects have the
first outburst spectra, and the others were also compared with the published
outburst spectra. We argue that these data will be useful for further
investigation of the accretion disc properties. The HeII $\lambda$4686 emission
line can be found in the outburst spectra of seven dwarf novae. These objects
are excellent candidates for probing the spiral asymmetries of accretion disc.
