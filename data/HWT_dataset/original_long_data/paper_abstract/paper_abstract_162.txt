In this article, we study logics of unknown truths and false beliefs under
neighborhood semantics. We compare the relative expressivity of the two logics.
It turns out that they are incomparable over various classes of neighborhood
models, and the combination of the two logics are equally expressive as
standard modal logic over any class of neighborhood models. We propose
morphisms for each logic, which can help us explore the frame definability
problem, show a general soundness and completeness result, and generalize some
results in the literature. We axiomatize the two logics over various classes of
neighborhood frames. Last but not least, we extend the results to the case of
public announcements, which has good applications to Moore sentences and some
others.
