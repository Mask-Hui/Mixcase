Manganese, in the a-Mn structure, has been studied using synchrotron powder
x-ray diffraction in a diamond anvil cell up to 220 GPa at room temperature
combined with density functional calculations (DFT). The experiment reveals an
extended pressure stability of the a-Mn phase up to the highest pressure of
this study, in contrast with previous experimental and theoretical studies. On
the other hand, calculations reveal that the previously predicted hcp-Mn phase
becomes lower in enthalpy than the a-Mn phase above 160 GPa. The apparent
discrepancy is explained due to a substantial electron transfer between Mn
ions, which stabilizes the a-Mn phase through the formation of ionic bonding
between monatomic ions under pressure.
