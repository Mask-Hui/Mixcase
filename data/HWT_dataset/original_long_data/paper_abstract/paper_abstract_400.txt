Manganese, in the a-mn structure, has been studied using synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction in a diamond anvil cell up to 220 gpa at room temperature combined with density functional calculations (dft). The experiment reveals an extended pressure stability of the a-mn phase up to the highest pressure of this study, in contrast with previous experimental and theoretical studies. On the other hand, calculations reveal that the previously predicted hcp-mn phase becomes lower in enthalpy than the a-mn phase above 160 gpa. The apparent discrepancy is explained due to a substantial electron transfer between mn ions, which stabilizes the a-mn phase through the formation of ionic bonding between monatomic ions under pressure.
