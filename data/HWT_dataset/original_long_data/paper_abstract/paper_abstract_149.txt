The temporal evolution of the levels in a three-level laser is macroscopically described by a closed set of rate equations. Here, we complement this picture by providing a model which describes through chemical reactions how the levels are evolving. In most textbooks, the chemical potential is introduced as a concept in quantum statistics. In this paper, we alternatively base its definition on population densities of the excited states in a dopant atom. Then the chemical reaction model delivers a clear and intuitive framework to define the further thermodynamic characteristics of the atom-field interactions such as the chemical potential of the photon and the photon entropy.
