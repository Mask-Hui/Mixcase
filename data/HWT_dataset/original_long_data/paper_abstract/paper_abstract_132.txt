Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a short-range data transmission technology that
is used for multimedia file sharing, home automation, and internet-of-things
application. In this work, we perform packet error rate (PER) measurement and
RF testing of BLE receiver in the harsh electromagnetic environment and in
presence of RF interference. We check the PER performance in the line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenario in absence of any interfering
signal and in presence of wideband WLAN interference. The BLE PER measurements
are conducted in a large reverberation chamber which is a rich scattering
environment. Software-defined-radio has been used to create BLE communication
link for PER measurement in LOS and NLOS configuration. The BLE PER is measured
both in the presence and in absence of WLAN interference. Our measurement
results show a higher PER for uncoded BLE PHY modes in NLOS channel condition
and in presence of wideband interference. Whereas coded BLE PHY modes i.e.
LE500K and LE125K are robust to interference with lower PER measurements.
