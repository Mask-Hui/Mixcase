High dimensionality poses many challenges to the use of data, from
visualization and interpretation, to prediction and storage for historical
preservation. Techniques abound to reduce the dimensionality of fixed-length
sequences, yet these methods rarely generalize to variable-length sequences. To
address this gap, we extend existing methods that rely on the use of kernels to
variable-length sequences via use of the Recurrent Neural Tangent Kernel
(RNTK). Since a deep neural network with ReLu activation is a Max-Affine Spline
Operator (MASO), we dub our approach Max-Affine Spline Kernel (MASK). We
demonstrate how MASK can be used to extend principal components analysis (PCA)
and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and apply these new
algorithms to separate synthetic time series data sampled from second-order
differential equations.
