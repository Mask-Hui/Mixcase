We compute the conservative van-der-Waals forces between two atoms, one of
which is initially excited, in the limit of identical atoms. Starting with the
perturbative calculation of the interaction between two dissimilar atoms, we
show that a time-dependent approach in the weak-interaction approximation is
essential in considering the identical atoms limit in the perturbative regime.
In this limit we find that, at leading order, the van-der-Waals forces are
fully-resonant and grow linearly in time, being different upon each atom. The
resultant net force upon the two-atom system is related to the directionality
of spontaneous emission, which results from the violation of parity symmetry.
In contrast to the usual stationary van-der-Waals forces, the time-dependent
conservative forces cannot be written as the gradients of the expectation
values of the interaction potentials, but as the expectation values of the
gradients of the interaction potentials only.
