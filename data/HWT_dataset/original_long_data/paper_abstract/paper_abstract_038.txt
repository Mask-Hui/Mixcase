Given a group $g$ and an endomorphism $\varphi$ of $g$, two elements $x, y \in g$ are said to be $\varphi$-conjugate if $x = gy \varphi(g)^{-1}$ for some $g \in g$. The number of equivalence classes for this relation is the reidemeister number $r(\varphi)$ of $\varphi$. The set $\{r(\psi) \mid \psi \in \mathrm{aut}(g)\}$ is called the reidemeister spectrum of $g$. We investigate reidemeister numbers and spectra on direct products of finitely many groups and determine what information can be derived from the individual factors.
