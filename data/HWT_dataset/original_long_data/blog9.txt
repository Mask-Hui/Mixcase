                 I was thinkin back to a poem I wrote a while ago, thought I had saved a copy...and now can't find it...I am going to try to get it back out of the deep recesses of my brain though. Too bad it never found it's way to anyone who appreciated it though lol.  If Time was a River  If time was a river that flowed to the sea And love was the vessel that would carry me I'd pack it with patience with laughter with care with passion and friendship and take some to spare If time was a river that flowed to the sea And love was the vessel that would carry me I'd need someone steadfast to be on my crew And if I had get to choose, I plan to choose you   Ok that's not exactly the original but not bad if I do say so myself. I should dig up my old poems and get them on the blog...might be good for trip down my dark and twisted memory lane.  I was actually missing work today, but know I am not ready to go back just yet. A couple more weeks and I should feel better able to face the world head on again. It's been nice to just kind of see where the day takes me, but then I think about all those people I am not getting to help. I sometimes shake my head at the apathy so many of my co-workers have...then again so many people in the world are apathetic. When I get to hear 'wow thank you soooo much why has no one ever taken that time to explain this to me?' or 'You are a dear you took all my worries away' at least I know for the few minutes that person talked to me they felt like someone, somewhere cared about who they were and what they needed. Someone told me I had too much to give one time, isn't that what it's about though?? You give of yourself to the right people...and they give back to you...not rocket science yannow? Or give the right things to the right people. I almost wonder if it takes a stronger person to accept that you deserve to be given back to...instead of feeling like you constantly are going to 'owe' something to someone.   Cheers!
