Kate symes 6-27-02.nsf hello, i hate to bug you with this. Whenever you can spare a second would you ask bob about this? i am afraid it is going to slip through the cracks. Thanks for your help! melissa ---------------------- forwarded by melissa ann murphy/hou/ect on 03/29/2001 12:07 pm --------------------------- melissa ann murphy 03/26/2001 10:34 am to: robert badeer/hou/ect@ect cc: kate symes/pdx/ect@ect subject: constellation cal px trades hi bob, i was wondering if you have contacted constellation about the 6 trades that are in the system with the cal px as the index price. All of these trades start flowing in july of this year. The deal numbers are as follows: 453152.01 453175.01 453294.01 462109.01 471888.01 471889.01 let me know if constellation agrees to change these deals to the dow jones so i can send a letter for them to sign. Thanks, melissa
