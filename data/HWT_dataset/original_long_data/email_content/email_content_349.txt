Cgerman.nsf i entered volume and pricing on the following 2 deals in sitara; deal 418015 cng citygate with tenn prod plus transport pricing. Deal 418065 cgas citygate with trco and cglf production pricing and trco, cglf, and cgas transport pricing (this will take a while to do). Do we want to turn the auto-confirms off? i think every time i create a vng deal, a confirm is faxed to them. And if anyone has a better was of doing the deals ( should we show these as production area sales), please let me know. The easiest way i can come up with is to enter the sales at the citygate or storage facility and have most of the pricing done in a worksheet.
