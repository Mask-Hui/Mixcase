Skean.nsf i am attaching the ferc order and staff recommendations. The order provides for $69 million in "potential" refunds (either pay up or provide cost justification). Enron was not named as one of the 13 overcharging parties, but pge was ($3.18 million). It's not over yet, though. The order deals only with jan 01 and promises further orders regarding dec 00 and benchmark prices through april 01. The prices used to determine refunds were fairly high ($273/mwh based on gas prices, emissions costs and an assumed heat rate of over 16000). With respect to sales to california, we have concluded at least one short term sale and have talked with cal dept of water resources about longer term deals, but we were still struggling with credit issues, last i heard. I'm copying jeff dasovich because i'm sure he has more up to date information.

Was enron a contracting party? do we think this is a good solution (i think i know the answer, but defer to your lead on this, so we stay on your message)? thanks mcs
