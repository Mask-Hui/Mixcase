Sbeck (non-privileged).pst john is keeping us updated on unify production problems, which unfortunatel= y occur rather frequently. When he cited the reason for performance issues= in his orginal e-mail message below, i asked him whether or not the unify = team was aware ahead of time that the server resynchronization was being ha= ndled during normal business hours. Here is his response. I bring this to= your attention not to create an issue, but rather to solve one. I know th= at everyone is incredibly busy, but with so many interdepencies here we hav= e to stay closely coordinated. I know that eol has a dedicated member of y= our team who is always on point and knowledgeable about infrastructure issu= es that could or do touch eol. Is there anyone assigned from your team for= a similar role with our critical operating systems? because of nomination= deadlines and the exchange of information with external parties for unify,= it can create real exposure (dollar exposure and pr exposure) if unify's p= erformance is impaired. Let me know if you can assign someone from the inf= rastructure team that can wear the responsiblity of staying in step with un= ify.
