Mary-hain.nsf portland general electric (pge) has a request for proposals (rfp) that epmi wants to submit an offer on. Pge is essentially seeking a fixed price for 50-200 mw 'round the clock for five years starting in '02 at portland's system, the mid-c, or cob south to north. Offers are due by march 28 and pge has until april 5, 2001 to accept . I have told mike that any deal with pge has to be approved by ferc under the terms of epmi's market based rate tariff. I have also told him that epmi could either make the offer subject to ferc approval or take the regulatory risk that ferc would in some way change the benefits of any contract in pge's favor. I would recommend the former. Ron - would you tell me how much you would charge to draft a ferc filing, for my review, in the event pge accepts our offer? jim - i intend to submit an rcr for this ferc filing. Is that okay?
