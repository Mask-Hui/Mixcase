Esager.nsf elizabeth and mark taylor of houston derivitives fame, not the other guy whose name shows up on the directory, whomever that may be, here is documentation that you need to look at in preparation for the call i am trying to organize with both of you. ----cgy -----original message----- from: choi, paul sent: thursday, may 24, 2001 11:03 am to: yoder, christian subject: fw: pacificorp -----original message----- from: hoog, david sent: thursday, may 17, 2001 4:22 pm to: tim belden/hou/ect@enron; choi, paul subject: pacificorp this is the term sheet that was produced by pacificorp for the outage protection. It looks like it was developed with input from aquila and swiss re. Swiss re is generally not interested in doing anything in the est now, so that could be the reason behind their ridiculous bid of $200m (which is still just heresay). There is some price, eg $100m, at which this risk is manageable through a combination of advance hedging and dynamic hedging as their system experiences outages. We have 8 days notice before having to deliver, so the weather-related spike risk is not that severe. We are doing stochastic modeling of the risk now, and we expect the "fair value" to be less than $50m. This is a 3-year deal, and one of the benefits is that they may pay the premium up front and expense it by year. This is a complex structure, so let me know if you have questions.
