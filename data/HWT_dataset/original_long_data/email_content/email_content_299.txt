Rhaysle.nsf to all: hope this clarifies-- we are currently collating needs data from our interview cycle. Preliminarily, the interviews confirm our suspicions: 1. Cost & p/l reporting is the most widely held concern. 2. Cash flow reporting (treasury, direct & indirect) follows closely. 3. There is no easy, readily available solution to ferc reporting. 4. People have lost ad hoc query functionality with the implementation of sap. Project sunrise's reporting charter will be to address these needs in the most efficient, cost effective way possible. That could be through a data warehouse, could be through the ferc sap module, could be through another avenue. None of us has the answer to the methodology question yet (although we all have ideas). I would prefer to keep the project sunrise team focused on the task at hand -- sifting through the interview information and developing a work plan. We have followup interviews to schedule & complete, a data model to build, etc. Basically a lot of work on our plates. However, ferc reporting is clearly a significant need that will be at the forefront of any reporting solution. If our goal is to discuss this need in detail tomorrow, i'm all for it! i need the education. If our goal is to look at progress towards a solution, we should look to postpone. I take responsibility for distracting efforts in progress, but believe the delay worthwhile. One final issue: sean, the sensecorp consultant who has been working on the project, is in california. We may want to wait on his participation. I believe we are all on the same page.

I would just be sure not to jump to the dw as the solution, unless the isc has been given ample opportunity to propose a solution. Be sure to go that route, too! david mcellin 12/01/2000 05:37 pm to: melissa becker/corp/enron@enron cc: ozlem mahmood/hou/ees@ees subject: re: ferc data warehouse will we be proceeding with the dec 5 meeting? if so, ozlem could you get notice out to the original distribution list concerning time and location. I will be out of the office on monday, so i would appreciate your assistance in coordinating the meeting logistics. Thanks. ---------------------- forwarded by david mcellin/fgt/enron on 12/01/2000 05:35 pm --------------------------- david mcellin 11/30/2000 04:56 pm to: melissa becker/corp/enron@enron cc: rod hayslett/fgt/enron@enron, james saunders/fgt/enron@enron, sheila howard/corp/enron@enron, mark frank/hou/ect@ect subject: re: ferc data warehouse i feel we should proceed with the dec 5 meeting, at least to get a better understanding of what the data warehouse can do for us related to ferc, and maybe determine just how far along it currently is. The original reason we were asked to meet on this issue is that it was thought that a lot of work had already been completed and it wouldn't take much to deliver an end product. The other attendees, as well as myself, need to understand what this can do for us as opposed to a potential solution in sap.

In addtion to project sunrise, i have asked sheila howard, who is the lead for the financial team in the isc, to work with the project sunrise team to understand what your issues are and help determine a solution. Let me assure you that whether through the project sunrise or the isc, we are working on your issue and it has not dropped off the radar screen. As a matter of fact, project sunrise had a status meeting today, and this came up several times. I think the only question is "what's the best approach for solving it"? i will leave it to dave, as the ets representative to project sunrise, along with sheila, mark, and the others listed below, to continue to work on a solution for the ferc problems. Dave - is there any reason not to proceed with the december 5 meeting under these assumptions? i would just ask that sheila be included.

However, i will be recommending that a focus group be designated for ferc. Thank you for your help and patience and i apologize for the upheaval and postponements.
