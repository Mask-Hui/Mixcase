Call-in number is 888-422-7124 particpant code is 111756 status report after a marathon 12 hour meeting with assemplyman keeley, senator battin, qf parties, and sce, a keeley sponsored "deal" was proposed at 3:30 a.m. This morning. The crux of the deal is as follows: for renewables and non-gas fired qf, essentially ... 7.8 cents/kwh for delivered power for 5 years ["all in", i.e. Includes capacity and energy] 1.0 on losses no 'clawback' for wind resources which may have failed to meet fixed capacity obligations in the past applies "going forward" (presumedly feb. 1) for gas-fired qfs... 7.8 cents/kwh for five years, assuming gas is $5.60; payment will increase/decrease tied to gas (this assumes an ier of 9821) 1.0 on line losses applies "going forward" caacity true-up and "forbearance" were not addressed. Credit worthiness will be address in the technical conference scheduled for later today (sunday). This program will require in part legislative blessing and direction, followed by cpuc approval of individual contract amendments. This is essentially the pg&e/qf "deal" for the gas guys. For the renewables, it is more of a fixed payment approach. A "technical conference" is scheduled for sunday (today) in sacramento to work out some of the implementing details.
