Kmann.nsf hello - in order to cross one more item off of the enovate setup list, i would like to pursue the initial capital contribution required under the llc agreement of $100,000 from each member. Although we do not have loan facilities in place or final cash management protocol, i believe the initial funding can still take place. If anyone has any other thoughts please let me know. If not, i would like to schedule the initial funding for friday, october 6th. I believe that mary lynne will prepare the necessary vouchers and journal entries. I am assuming that enron mw, l.l.c., as member, will be funding enovate, l.l.c. Does ena then fund enron mw, l.l.c.? (kay? mary lynne?) as an update - peoples' board meets next wednesday, oct. 4th to approve the risk management policy. Assuming approval, enovate will be free to transact with third parties. Therefore, depending on payment terms, money will begin flowing through the enovate account. Therefore, any loan docs and service agreements should be in place by the second week of october. Any thoughts, please let me know. Thanks, gregg
