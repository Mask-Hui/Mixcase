Vkamins (non-privileged).pst yvan, i shall find out who was trying to reach you. It will help if your uncle knows all the details (your cell number, etc.) vince -----original message----- from: "yvan go" <yvango@hotmail.com>@enron sent: tuesday, october 30, 2001 11:20 pm to: kaminski, vince j subject: re: yvan go from berkeley hi, vince i hope everything is fine with you. I am following the news and issues about enron. This has not in anyway change my resolve in working for the company. I am sure the chairman will stir the company into the right direction. I mentioned to you that i was interviewed two weeks ago by andy lewis of the trading group. It was an excellent discussion focusing on similarities in the career path that i and andy took. Andy reinforced what i read in the trading naural gas book by fletcher sturm who happens to be his previous seatmate. More than anything else, it was a great conversation that lasted for one hour and fifteen minutes. He mentioned, however, that he initially found me overqualified. I assured him, nonetheless, that i am committed to the task at hand. The following day, my uncle received a call from someone at enron who was looking for a number to call me at the university. I surmised this was the second trader who will talk to me as andy mentioned previously. I left two voice messages at andy's home and office number. I have yet to receive the second call. I am very much interested in pursuing the application. I will write a separate e-mail to todd peikert of hr to check on the status of the program. Just wanted to let you know.
