We are currently using the following country curves you provided previously: 1) philippines: 90700 2) thailand: 51500 3) korea: 62300 4) china: 50900 5) taiwan: 20800 6) us: 81700 i agree in principal with the methodology and understand the approach, given the info you have. However, you have just provided a new curve for thailand, which, was just provided to us in may. Given the methodolgy you explained earlier, i find it hard to believe we would see such a huge impact (35% decrease on a 25 year pv basis) on our coco valuation (thai project). It appears that this thai curve is not using ppp, and i'm not saying your analysis has to be ppp, but most would expect that given the varying economic environments and market places we deal with, ppp is a widely accepted practice/method, as we cannot predict the future. Please provide us a detailed reconcilation among the two curves and the country rational in coming up with the revised curves from 4 months ago. Please contact me if you have any questions at 011-852-2588-1234. Regards, ramon
