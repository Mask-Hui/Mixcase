Erisa & texas law: united states supreme court holds that erisa plan provisions prevailed when man received life insurance policy and pension plan in divorce, died shortly post- divorce, but never changed beneficiary designation of ex-wife with plan's administrator.

Admissions undeemed: mandamus conditionally issued to trial court to vacate order, after hearing within 30 days of trial, denying motion to undeem ultimate-issue admissions when record showed that party failed to respond because of law firm's accident or mistake.

Meyer v. Meyer, 232 wis. 2d 191, 606 n.w.2d 184 (2000).

No horsewhipping allowed: lawyer, who had affair with client, added "insult to injury" by billing client for legal services after breaking off relationship, but actions did not constitute intentional infliction of emotional distress because not "extreme and outrageous" as matter of law.

App. - houston [1st dist.] 2001, pet. Denied).
