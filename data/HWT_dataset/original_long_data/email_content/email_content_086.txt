Skean.nsf larence is running up against the deadline for associates to be promoted or move out. Here is my concern: larence has been worked for a number of people who ended up leaving the company: he worked for dave ramm at enron wind (dave left). He also worked for john palmisano who also has left the company. He ended up in a structuring group working for brad richter. It's hard to sort out what happened there but perhaps because of larence's lack of interest in the area, which he apparently expressed to brad, he has not done much structuring work and brad is not inclined to promote him or keep him in the organization. He has been told that he needs to find something now. Could you guys look into this? perhaps we could either extend his deadline, or find him something through the redeployment process? ----- forwarded by steven j kean/na/enron on 12/08/2000 07:28 am ----- richard shapiro@enron 12/08/2000 07:10 am to: larence snowden/enron communications@enron communications cc: james d steffes/na/enron@enron@enron communications, steven j kean/na/enron@enron@enron communications subject: re: government / regulatory affairs opportunities i don't really have a need anywhere in my group at the momment- will keep you advised of any changes.
