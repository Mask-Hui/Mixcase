Hope this works mime-version: 1.0 content-type: multipart/mixed; boundary="=====================_350077262==_" vince, i must apologize to you about the version of the paper i sent last evening. I was pretty exhausted from the day and didn't stop to give it a proof reading (on paper). I still find that screen editing is a poor substitute for holding the paper and marking it up. There is still work to be done but i think the paper is improving with each iteration. I want to work more on documenting the specific "events leading up to the formation of the new unregulated business" including some documentation on the deregulation process and events in the natural gas market. Specifically, i remember conversations about "take or pay" contract defaults, etc. And the financial crisis they created. Also, gene humphries commented in a round table discussion that sheridan held at ut that carl ichan made a play for enron and this was fended off with a leveraged esop. I would like to get all the details to these issues to better "set up the section on marching to the beat of a new drummer". I hope this process isn't too frustrating for you. I am convinced that we will winnow out the story in the end if we persevere. Have a great weekend. Your friend, john - enron_paper_1_27_01.doc
