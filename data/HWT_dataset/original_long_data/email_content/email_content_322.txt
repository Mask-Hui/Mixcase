Mark guzman 6-28-02.nsf to further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing enro= n=20 america=01,s velocity of capital and associated return on invested capital,= we=20 have decided to create a capital book. The capital book will have no profit= =20 target associated with it and will be managed by joe deffner. The purpose o= f=20 creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within enron americas= ,=20 with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are=20 allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge.=20 the previous numbers used in the business plans at the beginning of this ye= ar=20 will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets.=20 therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the=20 capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will = be=20 maintained by the originating business unit subject to the internal ownersh= ip=20 policy outlined below. The cost of capital associated with all transactions in enron americas will= =20 be set by joe. This process is separate and apart from the current rac=20 process for transactions which will continue unchanged. Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital char= ge=20 at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structure= d=20 off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred= =20 cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge.=20 transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be= =20 priced based upon the financial impact on enron america=01,s overall credit= =20 capacity. On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the capital= =20 book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way th= e=20 credit group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used=20 specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted=20 above, the capital book will have no budget and will essentially charge out= =20 to the origination and trading groups at actual cost. By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, enron america= =01,s=20 sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the=20 organization.=20 questions regarding the capital book can be addressed to: joe deffner 853-7117 alan quaintance 345-7731
