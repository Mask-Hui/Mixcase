Chris germany 6-25-02.pst i don't think the triggers are correct. Ed, this brings up a good question that may already be addressed. Both of the midland deals still show up in the trading system. Should they be terminated effective 6/1/2002? one of the midland deals (mcv 2, deals #340305 and 332163) was put in sitara with triggers. We stopped serving mcv 2 effective 4/1/2002. These triggers will continue to create an invoice each month unless we change the deal in sitara. -----original message----- from: price, wade r.

Max doner thought these deals would not trigger activity anymore per your note to him on 5/13. I see where these deals were updated by you on that date. Are the deals legit, or are the triggers generated legit. Please let me know asap. Thanks wrp
