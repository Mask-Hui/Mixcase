The earliest anticipated need for gas would be saturday morning, july 28. The task at startup will be to blow steam through the system at high velocity in order to purge possible debris from steam lines. In this situation, gas will be needed but electric power will not be produced. I will update everyone tomorrow morning on our plans for the weekend. Ken
