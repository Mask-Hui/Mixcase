Esager.nsf after our conference call last week, i received word from reliant (who has offered to host our meetings) that they cannot do meetings on 7/30, 7/31, or 8/1. Please respond to this email and indicate whether you would be available on either 7/23 - 7/26 or 8/8 - 8/10. Again, one day would be used for the collateral annex and the other for the optional provisoins to be used with the master agreement. I have sent a separate messgage to the collateral annex group.
