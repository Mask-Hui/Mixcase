This is a picture from one of my first assignments in march of last year during spring break in panama city fl. The nice young lady in the picture is, along with all of the other "competitors", wearing a bigwords t-shirt. Wilson, i'll defer to grump for a joke. My next assignment is the national cheerleading championships in orlando fl in two weeks. Hope everything is going well for you guys, talk to you later.
