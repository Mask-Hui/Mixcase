Jdasovic.nsf sue, etal - it's important to monitor and support the section - (b) the right of a retail end use customer who has not purchased power from an electrical corporation on or after january 17, 2001 to purchase power from an alternate provider may not be limited by this section. I think that this would take care of the uc/csu issues (does anyone disagree)? jim susan j mara 03/01/2001 06:43 pm to: alan comnes/pdx/ect@ect, angela schwarz/hou/ees@ees, beverly aden/hou/ees@ees, bill votaw/hou/ees@ees, brenda barreda/hou/ees@ees, carol moffett/hou/ees@ees, cathy corbin/hou/ees@ees, chris h foster/hou/ect@ect, christina liscano/hou/ees@ees, christopher f calger/pdx/ect@ect, craig h sutter/hou/ees@ees, dan leff/hou/ees@ees, debora whitehead/hou/ees@ees, dennis benevides/hou/ees@ees, don black/hou/ees@ees, dorothy youngblood/hou/ect@ect, douglas huth/hou/ees@ees, edward sacks/corp/enron@enron, eric melvin/hou/ees@ees, erika dupre/hou/ees@ees, evan hughes/hou/ees@ees, fran deltoro/hou/ees@ees, gayle w muench/hou/ees@ees, ginger dernehl/na/enron@enron, gordon savage/hou/ees@ees, harold g buchanan/hou/ees@ees, harry kingerski/na/enron@enron, iris waser/hou/ees@ees, james d steffes/na/enron@enron, james w lewis/hou/ees@ees, james wright/western region/the bentley company@exchange, jeff messina/hou/ees@ees, jeremy blachman/hou/ees@ees, jess hewitt/hou/ees@ees, joe hartsoe/corp/enron@enron, karen denne/corp/enron@enron, kathy bass/hou/ees@ees, kathy dodgen/hou/ees@ees, ken gustafson/hou/ees@ees, kevin hughes/hou/ees@ees, leasa lopez/hou/ees@ees, leticia botello/hou/ees@ees, mark s muller/hou/ees@ees, marsha suggs/hou/ees@ees, marty sunde/hou/ees@ees, meredith m eggleston/hou/ees@ees, michael etringer/hou/ect@ect, michael mann/hou/ees@ees, michelle d cisneros/hou/ect@ect, mpalmer@enron.com, neil bresnan/hou/ees@ees, neil hong/hou/ees@ees, paul kaufman/pdx/ect@ect, richard l zdunkewicz/hou/ees@ees, richard leibert/hou/ees@ees, richard shapiro/na/enron@enron, rita hennessy/na/enron@enron, robert badeer/hou/ect@ect, rosalinda tijerina/hou/ees@ees, sandra mccubbin/na/enron@enron, sarah novosel/corp/enron@enron, scott gahn/hou/ees@ees, scott stoness/hou/ees@ees, sharon dick/hou/ees@ees, skean@enron.com, susan j mara/na/enron@enron, tanya leslie/hou/ees@ees, tasha lair/hou/ees@ees, ted murphy/hou/ect@ect, terri greenlee/na/enron@enron, tim belden/hou/ect@ect, tony spruiell/hou/ees@ees, vicki sharp/hou/ees@ees, vladimir gorny/hou/ect@ect, wanda curry/hou/ees@ees, william s bradford/hou/ect@ect, jubran whalan/hou/ees@ees, triley@enron.com, richard b sanders/hou/ect@ect, robert c williams/enron_development@enron_development, dwatkiss@bracepatt.com, rcarroll@bracepatt.com, donna fulton/corp/enron@enron, gfergus@brobeck.com, kathryn corbally/corp/enron@enron, bruno gaillard/eu/enron@enron, linda robertson/na/enron@enron, ren, lazure/western region/the bentley company@exchange, michael tribolet/corp/enron@enron, phillip k allen/hou/ect@ect, christian yoder/hou/ect@ect, jklauber@llgm.com, tamara johnson/hou/ees@ees, mary hain/hou/ect@ect, greg wolfe/hou/ect@ect, jeff dasovich/na/enron@enron, dirk vanulden/western region/the bentley company@exchange, steve walker/sfo/ees@ees, james wright/western region/the bentley company@exchange, mike d smith/hou/ees@ees, richard shapiro/na/enron@enron, leslie lawner/na/enron@enron, robert neustaedter/enron_development@enron_development, steve walton/hou/ect@ect, psmith3@enron.com, mjackso7@enron.com, janel guerrero/corp/enron@enron, mark fillinger/sf/ect@ect, jennifer rudolph/hou/ees@ees, martin wenzel/sfo/hou/ees@ees, douglas condon/sfo/ees@ees, wgang@enron.com, joseph alamo/na/enron@enron, tracy ngo/pdx/ect@ect cc: subject: sbx 27 -- direct access language proposed by bowen this is an ok bill. Not well drafted. It's also overly complicated and proscriptive. Deletes the offensive part of abx 1. It allows anybody to do whatever they want until june 1 (section 2 d) on june 1, - res and small commercial customers can get in a cue and get da up to the # of mws that are added through load growth. (section 2 e) -- larger customers would pay an exit fee. (section 2 f) -- da customers would be a entrance fee to return to iou service (section 2 g) there is also a confusing section (2 c) that says a retail customer is only stuck with cdwr for the proportion of power that cdwr provides. The way it reads, if cdwr is providing 40% of the ious' power, the retail customer can get da for 60% of its load. I doubt that will fly -- too difficult to keep track of and iso will oppose (only one scheduling coordinator/meter) a conference call and meeting is scheduled with parties tomorrow on this language. Will keep you apprised. Sue mara enron corp.
