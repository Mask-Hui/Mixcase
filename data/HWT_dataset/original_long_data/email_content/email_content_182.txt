Paul's wife had a baby yesterday, and paul will be back on thursday. So maybe item 3 can wait until paul's return. As for (2), yes - i will need a ps reader :o) again, let us check paul's diary on his return before fixing a time for quentin kerr 1 1. The resume you sent to me and grant looks quite good. I think it makes sense to interview this person and we can help you with a phone interview. Is this simon ??? thanks raymond vince j kaminski@ect 08/08/2000 06:30 am to: paul quilkey/enron_development@enron_development, raymond yeow/enron_development@enron_development cc: vince j kaminski/hou/ect@ect, grant masson/hou/ect@ect subject: thank you paul & raymond, it took more than a few days to catch up after i came back from australia. There are few things i would like to bring up to your attention. First of all, i would like to thank you for your hospitality. I learned a lot about the australian markets and was greatly impressed with the quality of the people at the sydney office. 1. The resume you sent to me and grant looks quite good. I think it makes sense to interview this person and we can help you with a phone interview. 2. I have received another resume that looks very promising. I am very interested in this guy and would be ready to bring him over to the states where we lack desperately technical talent. Can you help us by interviewing him in sydney? the main determination i need from you is whether he can function in a company like enron. As any good academic he sent his resume in a ps format and i shall fax you a copy in case you don't have a postscript reader on your system. 3. Christian werner does some really neat things on the weather front. I would like to determine if he can help us to upgrade our systems. Can we bring him to houston for a week to discuss the weather forecasting technology with mike roberts and joe hrgovcic? i think that he could learn a lot from mike and other weather guys here how we translate weather info into business-related information. I shall be glad to underwrite the cost of this trip. Vince
