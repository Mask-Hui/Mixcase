Vkamins.nsf hi vince, mark holsworth reviewed our contract on such a short notice. I thank mark for responding to our short-notice request. It turns out that we need to get this database to move forward on a number of things and have legal save some time for us is an excellent help. As mentioned below, it appears that pennwell's folks want to chat some more about this. Mark, can you schedule a conference call with these people to finalise this contract. I will be out of town all week next week on a lock-down deal meeting. Vince may be able to get on the conference call. I would greatly appreciate it if you could help us close this one! regards, ravi. ----- forwarded by ravi thuraisingham/enron communications on 02/20/00 12:38 am ----- russell@pennwell.com 02/18/00 06:16 pm to: ravi thuraisingham/enron communications@enron communications cc: toni.turnerbudd@sbtglaw.com subject: re: vmi agreements ravi - i would like to schedule a conference call between you, me, pennwell's counsel (toni turner budd), and enron's counsel to discuss your changes and finalize the kmi end-user license agreement.
