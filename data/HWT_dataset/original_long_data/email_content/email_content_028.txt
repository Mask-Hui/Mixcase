Dfossum.nsf ngpl has filed an application requesting approval to sell its interest in certain offshore facilities to green canyon and is also requesting non-jurisdictional status of the subject facilities. Northern owns an undivided interest in certain of the facilities being sold by ngpl. The commission has issued a data request to northern regarding its interest in the subject offshore facilities. I just became aware of this data request this morning. The ferc has requested that northern provide the following: "northern is requested to present formally its views to the commission on the jurisdictional status of its fractional ownership interest in these facilities. These submissions should include specific information regarding the current classification of the facilities, for purposes of accounting and rate treatment. " because northern's response is due on thursday, november 9th, i have taken the liberty of drafting a response for your review. This response is similar to northern's previous responses in other dockets. Please provide your comments by noon, wednesday, november 8 as northern must send its response to washington in overnigth mail for filing on thursday.

As you may recall, in those dockets (a copy of the applications were originally sent you in which your company also had some imput), ngpl requested authority to abandon, by sale to green canyon pipe line company, l.l.c. (green canyon) and east breaks gathering company, l.l.c. (east breaks), certain currently operational and previously abandoned and retired in place wholly and jointly owned laterals, meter, field compressors and appurtenances located offshore louisiana and texas. Ngpl also requested that ferc declare these facilities to be nonjurisdictional upon abandonment and tranfer to green canyon and east breaks. The above data requests require your company to submit its views on the jurisdictional status of your fractional ownership interests in the facilities (of ngpl also has an interest which ngpl is requesting to abandon in the above dockets) and request that your submission include specific information regarding the current classification of the facilities for purposes of accounting and rate treatment. I would call your attention attachment 4 to the applications in both dockets which show the facilities in question and the related ownership interests that ferc is referring to. For your conveniance i have attached excel spreadsheets of attachment 4 to both of the applications for your review. The data requests themselves can be downloaded on cips in the captioned dockets (i have attached below for your convenience the data request sent to koch as an example as the wording in these requests is identical except for the company and the addressee -- these requests are in wordperfect format). Your attention to these data requests is greatly appreciated. Thanks for your help. Kenneth a.
