Cgerman.nsf i just updated the egan exchange tickets and my worksheet for nov and dec. I think we were out of balance by about 10,000 last night - my fault. ---------------------- forwarded by chris germany/hou/ect on 11/10/2000 09:28 am --------------------------- chris germany 11/08/2000 01:41 pm to: crystal hyde/hou/ect@ect, william kelly/hou/ect@ect, victor lamadrid/hou/ect@ect, tricia spence/hou/ect@ect, lia halstead/na/enron@enron, jesse villarreal/hou/ect@ect cc: susan w pereira/hou/ect@ect, elizabeth l hernandez/hou/ect@ect, scott goodell/corp/enron@enron, judy townsend/hou/ect@ect subject: egan storage i took the volumes on deal 472520 (cpr storage) to 0 and moved them to the following deals.

We will be withdrawing this gas ratably in dec into texas gas. I will probably make a mistake or two on my deals because i'm kinda sleepy. Crystal will help me set up the deals on egan. I am currently using a cpr storage deal ticket and i believe that is incorrect. I will let everyone know the deal tickets by the end of the day.
