Klay.nsf dr. Lay: you will be pleasantly surprised to receive this e-mail from an enron=20 employee. Please note that you are the first and only person in enron that will know= =20 about the endeavors that this e-mail discusses. Background: in 1986 while i was taking a graduate course in economics as part of my mba= =20 program, i started to think that there exists some similarities between=20 economics and thermodynamics. In 1988, i discussed my initial thoughts with= =20 dr. Ibrahim oweiss, professor of economics at georgetown university and we= =20 agreed to investigate this topic. Since that time, i worked with professor= =20 oweiss on and off investigating the subject. In the last couple of years, w= e=20 started to make good progress, that was culminated recently by submitting= =20 three papers for publication (see table below). =20 list of papers #=09paper title=09abstract=09status 1=09on the analogies between =01&economics=018 and =01&thermodynamics=018= =09part i: =01&basics=018 =09=09this part identifies certain analogies between economics and thermody= namics.=20 the analogies between =01&abilities=018 and =01&energy=018, =01&utility=018= and =01&work=018,=20 =01&capital=018 and =01&heat=018, =01&marginal utility=018 and =01&pressure= =018, =01&relative income=018=20 and =01&temperature=018, as well as =01&labor effort=018 and =01&entropy=01= 8 are discussed. =09=09this part concludes that the suggested analogies bring about new appr= oaches=20 that will explain some economic complexities by borrowing or building upon= =20 some concepts, theories and experiences in thermodynamics. =09=09part ii: =01&applications=018 =09=09this second part builds upon the basics introduced in part i where an= alogies=20 between economics and thermodynamics have been drawn. In this part, the=20 application of the analogies is utilized to analyze some of the topics=20 economists deal with. This part presents a fresh approach that holds=20 promising vehicles that can explain some of the paradoxes economists have= =20 been facing for years. =09submitted for publications as a working paper at = the=20 department of economics at georgetown university. (november 2000) 2=09a new approach to =09=01&production theory=018=09this paper introduces a fresh approach to th= e production theory. =09=09unlike the conventional approach of relating production to capital an= d labor=20 along the line suggested by cobb douglas, the approach this paper takes is= =20 relating the production to utility change which in turn is related to chang= es=20 in capital and labor effort.=20 =09=09this approach affords more generality and helps in the explanation of= some=20 paradoxes that the cobb douglas theory could not explain. =09submitted for= =20 publications in =01&economic theory=018, (october 2000) 3=09the capital engine concept=09this paper presents a fresh approach that = explains=20 several observations in economics.=20 =09=09the concept is used to discuss some of the trends the economic growth= theory=20 exhibits. =09=09it is also used to explain gains in productivity associated with tech= nology=20 improvements. =09=09the capital engine concept presented in this paper could serve as a b= asis for=20 new growth theory.=09submitted for publications in =01&economic theory=018,= october 2000) =20 a fourth paper entitled "innovation: why" is under preparation. In this=20 paper, we are able to substantiate based on the concept of the capital=20 engine that innovation is the most important driver for economic growth. Yo= u=20 can see why i chose these two words in the title of the paper from my enron= =20 world. I have been collaborating with professor oweiss on my own time and i am=20 pleased that we managed to get to this point. Professor oweiss and i are no= w=20 convinced that we have reached some breakthroughs that could revolutionize= =20 the study of economics. We also feel that we can build further on what we= =20 reached, and even making more valuable contributions. I am sure that you will be pleased to learn of the above, of course being a= n=20 economist you shall appreciate it even more. As i reach this critical stage on our path of this research project, i wou= ld=20 like to seek enron support in two areas: i. Patent(s) / copy righting: i feel that the contributions that are covered in the three papers are= =20 original and may warrant patenting / copy righting.=20 since i am the primary author of these papers i wanted to have some=20 credit go to enron. Ii. Grant / sponsorship: i feel that my endeavors which have been purely on my own personal tim= e=20 so far, need to be replaced by a more concerted effort now that we have=20 reached a =20 critical mass. Towards this end, dr. Oweiss and myself are taking step= s=20 to get funding from the national science foundation for a joint research=20 project that=20 would be carried out through the georgetown university. I do not know of any particular programs within enron that would affor= d=20 me the opportunity to complete a project like the one we are envisaging. = =20 i feel that such a research program will be very valuable. I am furth= er=20 convinced that such program will not be only of an academic value but it wi= ll=20 have=20 significant impact to the business world. I trust that the publicity that enron being the leading company in=20 innovation would get out of the success that i am hoping for the proposed= =20 research project will be many folds the amount of money enron would=20 contribute to the proposed effort.=20 i would be delighted to send you copies of the three papers and / or make a= =20 brief presentation on the subject. I wish to thank you for taking the time to read the above e-mail amid your= =20 busy schedule.=20 regards, hemmat safwat general manager, development engineering enron middle east i
