He wants the newest lyle lovett album -- the soundtrack to dr. T and the women. Also, he is getting a playstation ii from me for his birthday (they don't come out until this week, so he doesn't have it yet), so you could find him a game for the new system. He has said that he wants a new clock radio, with am/fm (i don't think he wants cd/tape player on it), with battery backup -- sony would be best. Also, he always wears short-sleeved polo shirts, size xl. He prefers basics, in solid colors such as white (he never can have enough of those), navy, khaki, or light blue. Let me know if you need any other suggestions. We are looking forward to your visit, especially cameron. He always is talking about how santa is going to bring presents for him and madison! take care, and say "hi" to marianne.
