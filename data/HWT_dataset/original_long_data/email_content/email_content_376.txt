Jdasovic.nsf good evening all: attached are (1) a revised clean draft of our ongoing briefing outline and (2) a redlined version of the outline.? a few notes: i have not yet prepared appendix a, the definition of net undercollected amount.? it would be useful for ann to make sure that the defined term in the mou still works in this context.? ann, would you please put together the appendix for inclusion? jeff dasovich has committed to providing a criterion for determining when the retail market is viable.? this is a very important issue both to large customers and, i would assume, to esps.? we look forward to hearing from jeff on monday on this point. We have no new information from the "coming and going" subcommittee, but look forward to including that information when available. Customers (perhaps both large and small) would be well served to get together to talk about the interim rate relief section.? i'm not sure whether i've fairly captured the discussions (or whether the discussions were clear enough to capture).? at a minimum, this effort should move us one step closer to identifying the competing proposals. Enjoy your weekend! - draft issues outline 061401 (redline).doc
