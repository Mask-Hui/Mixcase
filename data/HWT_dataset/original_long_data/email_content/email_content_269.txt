Vkamins.nsf vince the audience consist of mostly first year graduate students in industrial engineering and operations research some doctoral students and faculty. A short introduction about opportunities for quantitative minded people at enron would be good. It would also be good if in your talk you can give some technical examples for people with a good analytic background but no much of a financial engineering background. Many of the first year graduate students go for a masters degree and wonder what they can do with an or masters degree. ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////// shmuel s.
