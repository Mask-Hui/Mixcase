Fredrickson [mailto:ds.fredrickson@mapp.org] sent: friday, november 17, 2000 5:22 pm to: 'rtc@mapp.org'; 'pemc@mapp.org'; 'mrc@mapp.org'; 'rin@mapp.org' subject: notice of pending changes (effective 12/18/2000) to mapp's loss repayment procedure notice of new mapp loss repayment policies and procedures at the direction of the regional transmission committee of mapp, new loss repayment policies and procedures will be implemented on december 18, 2000. These changes make the transmission customer, as identified on the oasis reservation, responsible for paying energy losses on mapp schedule f transmission service. Previously, the mapp source entity has been responsible for paying these losses. These changes do not modify the application of mapp's loss repayment procedure (lrp) to mapp member open access transmission tariff (oatt) customers. Changes to the administration of schedule f loss repayment include: o the schedule f transmission customer will now be responsible for the lrp losses on their energy schedules. O payment of third party impacts due to "through flowing" schedule f transactions (where the source and sink are both outside mapp) will be included in the lrp. O to facilitate the payment of third party losses, the customer will make arrangements with the source scheduling participant (ssp), as defined on the transmission reservation, to pay for energy transaction losses at the onset of a schedule. O the ssp will bank the losses for repayment of third party losses, one week later, to the day. The repayment is done, as it is today, according to a schedule sent out by the mapp center. For additional information please see the business practices section of mapp's schedule f oasis: http://mapp.oasis.mapp.org/documents/mapp/practices.html questions may be e-mailed to tom white at the mapp center: ts.white@mapp.org answers to frequently asked questions will be posted at the url given above. A copy of the revised section five of the policies and procedures document is attached. Dan fredrickson mapp transmission operations << file: lrppolicy20001218.doc >>
