Gnemec (non-privileged).pst i am ok with the matrix. Please also note that any gtc with a term of 9 months or longer should be signed by enron and counterparties. Nelson, are you ok with using a gtc spot for one-day deals? -----original message----- from: hesse, lisa sent: wednesday, november 14, 2001 5:32 pm to: nemec, gerald subject: re: ena upstream "matrix" see below is the template.

Can you please double-check it and see if anything has changed? based on this, one-day deals will fall under a gtc spot if we don't have a gisb in place with the producer. In that instance, we don't need special handling in sitara. Hope this helps. Please let me know what you find out from gerald.

Confirmation usage form deal type gtc firm pooled gas 1 - 12 months pooled gas gtc firm point gas 1 - 5 months wellhead gas committed reserves producer trades > 6 months gisb day-month trades not with producers with gisb gtc spot day-month trades not with producers without gisb thanks, judy
