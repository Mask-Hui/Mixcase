Please let me know if you want to stop by our place before we head out to enron field. We live really only a few miles away from downtown, so this could be a good pit stop for all of you that live out in the "burbs"! (no names mentioned). Anyway, let me know if you are able to come by and i will give you directions to our place. Hope all of you can make it! thanks, dawn 3-9353
