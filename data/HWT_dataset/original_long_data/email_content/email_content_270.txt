I called him to inquire about his current compensation. His current base salary is $115,000 with a minimum bonus of 20%. His last pay raise and bonus were in september 1999 and he is expecting a raise and a bonus this september. The offer we would like to give him ($85-90k base) is obviously way below his expectations. And i don't see how we can offer him what he expects from us ($125k base - on par with mine), as it would be placing him well above ronnie & osman who are definitely more experienced and, in my view, more qualified. Let me know what to do. Thanks, krishna.
