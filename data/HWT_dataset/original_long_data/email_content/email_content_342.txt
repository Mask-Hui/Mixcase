Vkamins.nsf shijie, additional changes. Abstract: the power market developments in the us have created several unique challenges for energy industry economists. We discuss the major factors underlying the exceptionally high volatility of electricity prices. We feel that some of them may reflect the flaws in power pools design and incomplete transition to fully deregulated markets in generation and transmission. The title is fine.
