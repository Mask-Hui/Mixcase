Sshackle.nsf as of this week enrononline has just started offering us/canadian dollar swaps online. As part of my review in determining whether a counterparty can transact these products online i look at the financial trading agreement database to see if there are any restrictions indicated, check the master swap agreement, and i am also looking at any board resolutions we might have received when we got the master agreement executed. What i am finding is that in the old days when we asked for resolutions evidencing the authority to enter into the master agreement/derivative transactions frequently the resolutions do not allow the counterparies to enter into currency transactions. Since transacting these currency transactions with our energy customers is a new area of business for us i just wanted us all to be mindful to check these old resolutions and not to rely solely on the "restrictions" contained in lotus notes.
