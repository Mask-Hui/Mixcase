I hope this clears up our misunderstanding. With respect to co#2, we have incorporated your final changes. Please find attached a marked and clean (i.e. Executable) copy. At your earliest convenience, please sign the clean copy where indicated, and scan and e-mail me the signed copy. I will call you first thing in the morning.
