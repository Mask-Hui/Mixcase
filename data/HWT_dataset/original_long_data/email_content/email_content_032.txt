Rorschach reagan: i wanted to confirm that you have received mayor hays' letter of 11/2 detailing the process we intend to follow in concluding the rfp process.

In your proposal you stated that you would utilized firm contracts inside entergy as sources for supplying nlr & benton. Can you identify the sources you would initially point to for submission of the network transmission service request. 2. Confirm our understanding that your price includes schedules 3 - 6 costs. 3. Please identify each major party associated with enron's proposal and describe the role of each including contracting party, parent company of contracting party if different, owner of resources if different and any other parties that would have a role in the proposed transaction. 4. As you know benton does not have a scada system. We are unsure about bringing their metering points into our scada system. Do you have a per metering point price estimate to acquire the metering information directly from benton. I know this is short notice but if you could respond by close of business 11/6 it would be appreciated. Joe gertsch
