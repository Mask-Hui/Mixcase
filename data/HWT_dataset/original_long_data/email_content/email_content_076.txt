Jdasovic.nsf monday, december 11, 2000 to: all px market participants from: john yurkanin chief operating officer re: loss of continuity in px day ahead auction due to iso rule changes the emergency tariff filing by the california iso last friday has had a negative effect on the px day ahead auction market. The mixture of soft and hard caps results in a complete disconnect and unacceptable risk to all of our participants and will probably not provide the iso with its sought after reduction in real time energy sales and procurement. The overall effect will be that supply will still defer to the higher realized price opportunity the iso offers. The px is petitioning terry winter of the iso to immediately allow for adjustment bids on any submitted schedule at any price relevant. The hard cap retention on adjustment bids has resulted in a nullification of meaningful forward bids in the day ahead auction. This is not a software failure or issue with the iso; it is a policy issue that may have been overlooked in the iso ?s most recent emergency market response. We all commend the iso for its efforts in keeping the lights on and share their concern of an overworked staff trying to procure energy. But their recent policy change will not help california and undermines a meaningful reference price for spot markets. In addition to asking the iso to amend its emergency tariff the px is also filing directly today directly with the ferc an emergency intervention to ask for action to correct this market damaging outcome. Your support of our actions with both the iso and the ferc would be most appreciated.
