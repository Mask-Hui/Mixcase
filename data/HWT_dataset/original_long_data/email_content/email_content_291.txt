Sbeck.nsf entelligence is being used in houston, so they must have done training here. Patti is setting up my meeting with james for friday. I just left her a message and asked her to let you know the time that is scheduled for - plus i will leave you a message after i have talked with him. I hope to have that meeting with james at 10:30. Interruptions have been rampant - and i am still not finished with reviews. Shona will actually be in calgary at the same time that i will be, so we will do her review on the plane, in the airport or at the hotel - and i will tell her about the reorg. Again, i will leave you a message to let you know that we have had that conversation. That's great to have dinner with lou. I think that it would be good to find out from him what sort of interaction he has with the london office, what's working, what's not working - in an informal way. Are they on an enron network? do they get enron e:mails? how often does lou go to london or someone from london mid office come to new york? i still suspect that new york is somewhat neglected just because of the distance between london and new york and the fact that there seems to be plenty for mike and his team to chew on in london. Particularly now with a renewed focus on the scrap metal business. Enrjoy the oprisk conference. They tend to be heavily attended by bankers and there focus is that direction as well, but there is a lot that we can glean from what they are doing. It snowed there a lot yesterday. Of course, according to peggy hedstrom, it is 0 degrees (daytime temp reading) and snowy in calgary. I look forward to seeing you in dallas. --sally beth apollo 02/06/2001 04:28 pm to: sally beck/hou/ect@ect cc: subject: re: entelligence training will start to check into this. I would like to see the training, so i can get familiar with the product. Have they delivered it in houston at all? thanks for the heads up on james for friday. I will be in ny at the conference, but at least that clears the way for me to start getting busy when we get back from the ase on wed. I am having dinner with lou colorusso, one of the metals guys in ny on thursday night. Marcello declined. Any issues you think i should discuss with him? i know there is a doorstep outstanding for the ny office. I will get the scoop from shona on those results before i go. How did shona take the news yesterday. I will wait for your go ahead to make contact with her on the re-organization. Enjoy the trip to calgary. I will see you in dallas on monday morning. Beth from: sally beck 02/06/2001 03:33 pm to: beth apollo/hou/ect@ect cc: subject: re: entelligence training fyi - i will meet with james on friday when he is back from london to go over the change in reporting for him. I gave his review the end of last week, but didn't get to review the reporting change. I will ask patti to let you know when i am meeting with james on friday. Wanted you to be in the loop on this - particularly when we are getting in front of commercial guys, i want this to be well done. The training may be great - i just wanted to make sure that james knew about avril's trip and that he was aware of the content and delivery on the training. Looks like he still has some homework to do. --sally ---------------------- forwarded by sally beck/hou/ect on 02/06/2001 10:24 am --------------------------- james scribner@enron 02/06/2001 03:21 am to: sally beck/hou/ect@ect cc: subject: re: entelligence training not yet.
