Skean.nsf enclosed is a memo setting forth a schedule for obtaining the outstanding sec approvals before the end of april. Without concluding that the sec will necessarily renotice the merger application, we believed it necessary to allow for the possibility. The result, as you see, is a tight, albeit doable, schedule. In particular, it underscores the need to develop our story for the sec as quickly as possible, consistent with the other impossible demands that folks are placing on sierra's time. If you have any questions or there's anything we can do to help, please call me at (202) 986-8281. Best joanne - #189265 v1 - sierra-pge timing.doc
