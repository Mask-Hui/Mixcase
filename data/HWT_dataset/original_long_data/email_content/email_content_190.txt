Hpl will be responsible for setting a 6"x6" tee, riser, and above-ground valve on the spanish camp lateral. I suggest the 6x6 because the gas sales contract that will go along with the facilities agreement should specify an hpl scheduled delivery rate from 0 to 20,000 mmbtu/d. The 6-inch will minimize pressure losses off of the spanish camp line and will maximize our ability to expand this point in the future, if necessary. Assume that we will need to acquire a small section of surface easement for the above-ground valve. Looking at our as-built drawings (hc-1025-09-h) it appears that the mobil line crosses the spanish camp 6-inch at station plus 77+40 in the middle of a pasture. I spoke with lonnie earlier today, who said that he would be in that area on wednesday and can verify that i have correctly located the line. The crossing pipeline is incorrectly identified as a 16-inch natural gas line on the as-built. Mary jo has asked for some agressive timing on setting the tee, in that she would like to have it set for an 1 october, 1999 completion date. In that light, would you please approach this from the perspective of preparing a work-order rather than a preliminary cost estimate. If any of these specifications change, i will let you know immediately. Thanks, chris sonneborn hpl facility planning n.a. Gas and transmission asset group
