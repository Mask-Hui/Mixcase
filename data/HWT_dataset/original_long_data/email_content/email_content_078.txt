Mary-hain.nsf in a recent organizational memo, i mentioned what a great time this is to b= e=20 at enron. I believe that more strongly than ever, given the new markets we= =20 are entering, the enhanced focus of the company on markets and regions arou= nd=20 the world that best fit with our core competencies, and the phenomenal grow= th=20 of the company, perhaps best evidenced by the earnings report of the first= =20 quarter. But, there are challenges as well: california, and its regional a= nd=20 global implications, and the general market conditions that have brought ou= r=20 stock price well off its recent highs. With respect to each of these and= =20 other challenges, there are invariably opportunities: for example, the=20 enhanced opportunity for the ferc to finish the job of opening wholesale=20 electricity markets in the context of california; and, in the context of a= =20 lower stock price, a recognition that accelerated growth in earnings will= =20 bring the stock price to new highs in the not too distant future. One way= =20 that earnings can grow beyond wall street expectations is by bringing a bit= =20 more discipline to how all of us spend money at enron. We in government=20 affairs can point to many efforts and processes that have been designed to= =20 instill that spending and resource allocation discipline in the last few=20 years. We have always done our part, but there is always more that can be= =20 done. To increase earnings and, correspondingly, the stock price, i recently met= =20 with various government affairs group heads to discuss ways government=20 affairs can do things better and more cost effectively. We looked at group= =20 travel costs, outside services, and other budget items. Attached for your= =20 review and use is a copy of a new travel policy and new cell phone policy,= =20 which i believe, will ensure consistency across the group and deliver cost= =20 savings. Such travel policies already exist in various regions such as enr= on=20 europe. (regional business unit travel policies will continue to be applied= ,=20 where applicable) further, as a result of our review of the budget, we have identified saving= s=20 across the north american group in excess of 1.5 million dollars (usd). Th= is=20 is in addition to almost 2 million dollars (usd) by which the enron europe= =20 government affairs budget has been reduced, as well as significant reductio= ns=20 that have occurred in the south american group. Finally, i have also decide= d=20 to create a global government affairs hiring committee, which will evaluate= =20 the need for any proposed hires (new and existing positions). The purpose = of=20 the committee will be to assess whether the need is valid and, assuming it= =20 is, determine the most effective way to fill the position. By encompassing= a=20 cross-section of the government affairs group globally, it is my hope that = we=20 will arrive at better hiring decisions. The hiring committee will consist = of=20 aleck dadson (toronto), sue nord (houston), jim steffes (houston), paul=20 dawson (london), doug wood (london), nick o=01,day (tokyo), sergio assad (s= ao=20 paulo), linda robertson (washington) and myself. The committee will meet = on=20 an as needed basis. I believe that these changes will allow us all the opportunity to provide= =20 more cost effective and efficient service to the business units we support.= =20 i encourage each of you to review the new policies and provide feedback.=20 thank you
