Jdasovic.nsf one minor edit---it's the px, not the iso, that's taken itself into voluntary bankruptcy. See redline version attached. Only other comment: i'm not sure that, technically/contractually, we entered into transactions with the px (in the same way that i don't think that folks enter into transactions with nymex). (see opening line of last paragraph.) we have exposure to thepx based on our commercial activity that took place through the px, and that exposure depends on how the px /ferc decide particular issues. In short, we have transactions with the utilities, and exposure to the px based on transactions that we entered into with other counter parties via the px market mechanism. That said, seems to me that, for the purposes of the disclosure, the language is fine---just want to raise the flag. Might be useful to run it by richard sanders. Hope this helps. Best, jeff
