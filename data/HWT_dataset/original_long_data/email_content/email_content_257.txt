Jdasovic.nsf the spreadsheet below gives the implicit commodity based on the effective date of four different rates for the same rate schedule (schedule dr). The rate schedule effective august 2000 through september 2000 yields a much larger commodity charge because sdg&e customers will receive a lump sum reimbursement from sdg&e over those two months. Sdg&e customers will expect lower electric bills. Assuming that the lump sum reimbursement is not included in the implicit energy component, the average for june 2000 through january 2001 is 6.2 cts and the implicit commodity average from february 2001 through december 2001 is 7.3 cts. The average implicit commodity from june 2000 through december 2001 is 6.9 cts for deliveries starting september 1, 2000, the average would still be 6.9 cts. Assuming that the lump sum reimbursement is included in the implicit energy component, the average for june 2000 through january 2001 is 7.4 cts and the implicit commodity average from february 2001 through december 2001 is 7.3 cts. The average implicit commodity from june 2000 through december 2001 is 7.3 cts for deliveries starting september 1, 2000, the average would be 7.2 cts. Clarification: the caps apply the first 500 kwh consumed by all residential customers. For those who consume more than 500 kwh per month, the market rates will only apply for all consumption above 500 kwh. ---------------------- forwarded by bruno gaillard/sfo/ees on 08/23/2000 02:55 pm --------------------------- bruno gaillard 08/23/2000 02:33 pm to: christopher f calger/pdx/ect@ect cc: roger yang/sfo/ees@ees, james d steffes/hou/ees@ees, thane twiggs/enron_development@enron_development, sf directors, paul kaufman/pdx/ect@ect subject: re: energy prices embedded in the duque interim bill cap attached is an internal analyses put together by roger yang and myself reflecting the implicit energy charge as a result of duque's bill cap. The energy charge varies as new delivery rates are implemented throughout 2000 and 2001. The total number of residential customers in the sdg&e territory is approximately 1.1 million. According to duque's decision only 70% will be protected by the cap.
