Kmann.nsf this is a new transaction, so you can put in your two cents worth early! kay ---------------------- forwarded by kay mann/corp/enron on 01/10/2001 11:13 am --------------------------- kay mann 01/10/2001 10:45 am to: ben f jacoby/hou/ect@ect cc: subject: re: prototype letter agreement i would like to have a chance to read it, which i haven't. I still finishing up the intergen docs. The reason we were using a summary is that we don't know how ge is going to react, which might result in some changes to the contract. In the case of the lm's we had already agreed with ge concerning the terms applicable to the equipment after assignment. Kay from: ben f jacoby @ ect 01/10/2001 10:42 am sent by: ben jacoby@ect to: kay mann/corp/enron@enron cc: f_mitro@hotmail.com subject: prototype letter agreement kay: is there any reason we would attach a summary of the master 7ea facility agreement rather than a redacted copy? other than that, it looks good to me. Are you ok with us sending this out? also, it would be helpful to have all exhibits to send with the letter (i.e., llc agreement, facility agreement summary, escrow agreement, etc.) please let me know the status of these.

Also enclosed is a blacklined copy reflecting revisions from the december 15, 2000 draft of the prototype letter agreement. Although we have enclosed a blacklined draft reflecting revisions from the final draft of the ca/ed-i letter agreement, this is difficult to read due to our re-arrangement of the reps and warranties. If you have any questions or comments, please advise. (i have received the courier package with the ge facility agreements). Carolyn m.
