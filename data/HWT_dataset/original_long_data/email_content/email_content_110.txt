Sshackle.nsf you are fantastic! it looks like the trip is shaping up for a visit to ba around 9/12 with a longer stopover in sao paulo several days later which could last until 9/25 or the end of september. Will i have the visa before then? ss kaye ellis 09/02/99 10:44 am to: sara shackleton/hou/ect@ect cc: subject: visa for brazil i haven't given up on a multi-entry visa for brazil. I sent over a new letter for the consulate this morning. This letter states you will be visiting sao paulo several times during the next 12 months to attend various business meetings looking for new trading opportunities and conducting new negotiations for a planned trading desk in enron's sao paulo, brazil office. Supposedly, the key to a multi-entry visa is "new" opportunities in brazil. We should know by tomorrow if the consulate approves the multi-entry visa.
