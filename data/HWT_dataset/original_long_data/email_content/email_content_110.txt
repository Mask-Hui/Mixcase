Kate symes 6-27-02.nsf i'm sorry it's taken me so long to track down this name and number, but i finally spoke with someone at puget who said suzanne mcfadden is the person you need to talk to. Her number is 425-462-3844. If you need any other information, please don't hesitate to ask. ] thanks, kate kimberly hundl@enron 11/28/2000 07:41 am to: kate symes/pdx/ect@ect cc: subject: deal #467090 puget sound energy, inc. Can you please get a contact name and phone number for this counterparty from mike swerzbin as soon as possible? -i need to get a verbal confirm on this deal so that we can send out the confirmation letter and the number we have in the system has been disconnected. Also, we're checking on that other deal that i asked you about yesterday (i thought we confirmed it under the original deal # so i wasn't sure if we needed to confirm it again) thanks! kim
