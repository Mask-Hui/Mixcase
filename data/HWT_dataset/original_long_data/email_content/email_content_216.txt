We finished the initial design issues regarding input and output. We would like to have a meeting with you to seek feedback. We also preceeded to write the underlying model. So feedback at early stage can be important for the later development. Paulo issler is working on the short term enhancement to the credit loss model: adding asian option to the model built by vasant and amitava. Let me know when is a good time for us to meet. Zimin
