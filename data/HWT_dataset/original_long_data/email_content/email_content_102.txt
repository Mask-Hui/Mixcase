Owners are still quite concerned about the year as a whole and are actively seeking coverage. We spend much of last week covering all our short positions thru to may. Plan is to sit back for a couple weeks and then sell short again for q2, q3 and q4 if feasible. We struck a deal last friday with cetragpa ( pierre's ex co. ) by which we agreed a collar on the rbct/rotterdam route for 2002/2003. We bought a call at $7.80 and sold a put at $6.80 for 600,000 mt ( this could be valuable hedge for the first 2 years of the gijon business). On the panamax front, pacific market is still relatively active and strong while the atlantic is soft with few grain cargoes from the us gulf. We fixed last week a contract to supply 3 panamax vessels of coal and petcoke to aceralia ( spanish steel mill ). We are also currently seeking freight for our first freight and coal business into the us east coast ( thanks to the us coal guys ) on a belted self discharge handy max to load in second half of this year.
