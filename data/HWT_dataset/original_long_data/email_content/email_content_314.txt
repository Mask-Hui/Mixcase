Mendoza fernandez] on the 29th of last month, there was a double murder on the express train from paris to berlin. The engineer and the conductor were killed at the same time, even though they were at opposite ends of the train. This was confirmed by a police detective, who was the exact center of the train and heard both gunshots at the same time. When my cousin was told the story, he realized that both victims did not die at the same time. How did he figure it out? _________________________________________ scroll down to find the solution _________________________________________ ,.-:*'``'*:-.,_,.-:*'``'*:-.,_,.-:*'``'*:-.,_ .-:*'``'*:-.,_ *---- stop! been looking for the trinity trilogy? ----* we've got it and it's specially priced at three hilarious videos for only $29.98.

If both sounds had occurred at the same time at opposite ends of the train, he would have first heard the one from the front car, because the speed of the train was added to the speed of sound. For the sound from the back of the train, the speed of the train was subtracted from the speed of sound. For the detective to hear both shots at once means the man at the back of the train was killed first. ********************* readers comments ********************* hi janie, i think that darlene was talking about a completely different word. Darlene was thinking of the word suede (swayed). You wrote the word swede (sweed). The word was spelled corr- ectly in your puzzle. Darlene simply mis-identified it. Dianne **** hi janie, just one comment about "guy's" response to your "days of the week" tease. He gave you several answers which *contained* the letters sun. However, *none* of them had sun in the exact middle of the word (as the answer had to be). You need to have the same number of letters before and after the sun to be a correct answer. Nice try, guy. I really enjoy your daily teases.........they do keep my brain waves churning......something which my job has failed to do for me lately! paula [thank you all for writing in. I hope to hear more from all of you in the future! :)] ------------------------------------------------------------ questions? comments? email us at: <a href=" mailto:janie@thedailytease.com ">email janie</a> ------------------------------------------------------------ to unsubscribe visit: <a href=" http://www.shagmail.com/unsub/tease.html ">unsubscribe</a> special note: if you are having problems unsubscribing, i apologize for the inconvenience.
