Cgerman.nsf it's not a short pay that i am concerned with. They are a netout customer. They only billed us for $2,717,153.94. We show that we owe them $5,479,867.12. I thought that you were checking on a buy/sale that was supposed to cancel off some of this payable amount. They paid us $17,705,483.84, which is the net of what they owed us and what they think we owed them. Call if that doesn't make sense.

He said they may not have received all of the bill, there might have been some michcon activity missing.

I would like to get this matter resolved this week. Thanks darla
