The economy of the state is at risk. ? what the public wants in a solution to the energy crisis: ? re-regulation (restore balance to system). Very small, if any, rate increases. Reliability of supply (no more blackouts). No permanent damage to environment, more emphasis on renewable sources. Penalties for those who gouged the state. Guarantee this won=01,t happen again. ? themes of the fair plan: ? federal role:? the feds have refused to obey the law to maintain fair &=20 reasonable rates.
