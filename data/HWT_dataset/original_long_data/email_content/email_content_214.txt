I work in downtown denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in prospective and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching, but i have been known to sit in front of the tv and watch football or college basketball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and doesn't take themselves too seriously. ********************************************************* additional tips from match.com: our anonymous re-mailer will strip away your real email address, so that it will not appear in the 'from:' line.
