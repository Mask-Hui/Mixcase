Gnemec.nsf i have not read any of the following material. I wanted to forward the attached information from wildhorse on to everyone for an initial review asap. Based on my verbal conversations with kent harris (wildhorse) just now, we will probably need a meeting just to discuss their intent and understand the variables affecting the proposal. Also, as you will read below, this is only a working draft; i.e. They still have to make additional revisions............. After an in-depth analysis, i will present various options for the group to discuss and revise, if appropriate. Thx. D p.s. If i've left someone off the list above, please forward. I will caution that since we are officially involved in a sensitive (potentially difficult) negotiation, it may be more effective to have a smaller audience reviewing the proposal options to ensure there is no leakage of our leverage or negotiating position. ---------------------- forwarded by dan j bump/den/ect on 08/22/2000 05:51 pm --------------------------- enron capital & trade resources corp.

I am still reviewing and updating the agreement. At the very least, i still need to review and possibly modify the following sections: 1.13 - delivery point(s) 1.20 - gathering or gathering services 1.36 - plant 1.37 - plant delivery point 1.38 - plant fl&u 1.39 - plant receipt points 1.41 - processor 1.45 - shipper's gas 1.46 - shipper's residue gas appendix "a" - fl&u language and last, but not least, all of the articles on commitments, pressures, obligations, etc. That were originally modified in the enogex draft that frank nessinger created last year. Thanks for your patience. I will have the entire completed draft to you by this friday at the latest. Thanks, kent <<ga-crescendo-sa-low btu.doc>> - ga-crescendo-sa-low btu.doc
