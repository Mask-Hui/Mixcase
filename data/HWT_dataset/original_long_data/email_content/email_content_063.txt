Jsteffe (non-privileged).pst harry and jim, i am back from vacation and am trying to get caught up. I understand that pretty much everything (both the direct access vote and the px credit language) at the cpuc has been postponed. I wanted to make sure you and jim stay in the loop re the calculations (as best as we can make) estimating the difference between enron's recommended market rates vs. The utilities interim methodology for px credits. Please read the e-mail below and call if you would like to discuss.

Let me know if you'd like me to schedule a meeting to review these calculations and discuss next steps. Thanks. <embedded picture (device independent bitmap)>
