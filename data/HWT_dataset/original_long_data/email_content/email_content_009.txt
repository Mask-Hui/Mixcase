On the legal front, they are objecting to the bermuda law opinion. We cannot do this without an opinion. If we need to recommend bermuda counsel to them we can. On the credit side, for aig commodity arbitrage fund lp they want to increase the cross default threshold from $1,500,000 to $2,500,000. Paul, are you okay with this? i am okay with their other comments. Carol st. Clair eb 3889 713-853-3989 (phone) 713-646-3393 (fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com
