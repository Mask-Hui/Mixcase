Msmith18 (non-privileged).pst yes, i am serious. In years past, there have been skinned cats found in parks in portland, espcially black cats. I know it is gross, but it has happened. I would rather be safe than sorry. You know, i wasn't trying to preach to you in the last email, i'm sorry. -----original message----- from: smith, matt [mailto:matt.smith@enron.com] sent: wednesday, october 31, 2001 8:59 am to: laurel hazzard subject: re: um, are you serious about the cat thing because now i'm a little disgusted... -----original message----- from: laurel hazzard [mailto:lhazzard@firstam.com] sent: wednesday, october 31, 2001 10:50 am to: smith, matt subject: re: yes, you were a little intoxicated when we spoke last night, but you were sweet. That is kind of creepy that it is a full moon on halloween. I need to keep my cat inside because people steal cats on halloween and skin them. Well buck up little camper, in the scope of everything, things really aren't that bad. You could have to have life altering surgury. Since this thing with my family, it really has put a lot of things into perspective. I hope you feel better. Call me later.

I hope you weren't looking forward to speaking with a sober mat yesterday. I don't think i was that drunk, but who knows. Plus, i must be allergic to something because i can't stop sneezing. Oh, my life just sucks these days...j/k. Anyway, are you looking forward to tonight...especially with a nice full moon...make sure to look out for the goblins... -----original message----- from: laurel hazzard [mailto:lhazzard@firstam.com] sent: wednesday, october 31, 2001 10:28 am to: smith, matt subject: happy halloween! how are you feeling this morning? i know you love email correspondence, so you'll be sure to write back. ********************************************************************** this e-mail is the property of enron corp.
