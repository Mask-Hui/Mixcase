Dhyvl.nsf dave, i will be glad to generate the form of transaction agreement; however, i have a number of questions. 1. Relationship of delivery point and the use of interruptible transport on northwest pipeline. Is the transport upstream or downstream of the delivery point? if downstream, why isn't it being contracted for by eweb. 2. What volume is being sold each day. You use the term dcq and you also talk about a 20% tolerance above or below the estimated quantity. Normally their would be no tolerance with a dcq transaction. 3. Is this envisioned to be a requirements transaction. Is the price the same for volumes in excess of the estimated quantity up to an additional 20%. Is no penalty to apply if the actual volumes are 0% to 20% less than the estimated quantity? what if they take more than 20% in excess without making any arrangements for incremental gas. What price is to be used for such non scheduled excess volumes? please call me regarding the foregoing so that i can start to work on the transaction agreement.
