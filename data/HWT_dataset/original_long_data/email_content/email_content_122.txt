Kate symes 6-27-02.nsf spreadsheet has been updated and sent to neil bresnan, daniel kang, and jubran whalan at ees. Thanks for your help on this. Kate mark confer 03/05/2001 09:03 am to: kate symes/pdx/ect@ect cc: brooklyn couch/hou/ees@ees subject: ees spreadsheet update kate, i am checking out ees february deals with brocklyn couch and problems were noted on two deals 512775.1 on the 5th & 527967.1 on the 22nd. Ees was not agreeing to what we (enron power) has in enpower. Per phil platter our numbers are correct and the worksheet needs to be updated to reflect enpower. Ees stated they will adjust their numbers once they get an updated sheet. Thanks, mark
