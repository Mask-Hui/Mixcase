Vkamins.nsf while reviewing our trading limit documentation, i realized we never obtained signatures on the limit application for credit trading that was approved in the december bod meeting, and i'd like to complete our policy files. Would you please print the attached document and obtain bryan, ted, news/jordan and then sherriff''s signatures, and fax it back to me at 713 646 2194 for our files? i'll get vince to sign for research, and then send to rick buy and jeff skilling to sign along with our other trading limit policy documentation from the bod meeting this past week. This document is exactly what bryan sent to oliver in january, and i just customized it a bit to delete unnecessary signatures, identify the commodity group, etc.. Regards, cassandra.
