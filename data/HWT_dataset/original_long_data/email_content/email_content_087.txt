Skean.nsf steve, we will get the financial details necessary to continue with the rice proposal on tuesday afternoon. Traci has set up a meeting with wil uecker, associate dean for executive education (jones school), on tuesday morning where we will be discussing the school's systems and streaming needs. We should have a better idea after the meeting on what their needs will be in order to generate some numbers for you. Robert hoodis will be accompanying us during this meeting. He will help us assess the cost of e-powering the university and give us some suggestions on how we can extract the necessary revenue out of the deal.
