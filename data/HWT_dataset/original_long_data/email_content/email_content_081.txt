Esager (non-privileged).pst elizabeth --the changes by aep are on the 6th page, par. 8 and second last paragraph. I've called dave musselman to say we would accept those, and that i understood from louise kitchens that the collateral threshold number on page 2 should be $190m -- he's waiting on feedback from frank hilton in their credit group. I told him if they accepted the $190m number then aep should fill it in, sign the document and fax it here for countersignature and dispatch of our wire. I gave him my fax no. (713-646-3491) but said if aep had been provided a different fax no. By the enron credit group, he should use that one as well. -david [portz, david] -----original message----- from: dtmusselman@aep.com@enron sent: tuesday, october 30, 2001 5:28 pm to: portz, david subject: re: amendment re epmi collateral as discussed.(see attached file: 85892.doc) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ this e-mail message from the legal department of american electric power is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.
