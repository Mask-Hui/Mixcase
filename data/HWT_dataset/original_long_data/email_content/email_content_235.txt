Tjones.nsf tana, just wanted to keep you in the loop. I would be interested in your thoughts on the separate passwords. Regards, doug ---------------------- forwarded by doug sewell/hou/ect on 03/07/2001 03:51 pm --------------------------- shari stack 03/07/2001 02:38 pm to: doug sewell/hou/ect@ect cc: terri clynes/hou/ect@ect, edward sacks/enron@enronxgate subject: alliant agency relationship doug - as discussed, at the absolute minimum, we need the following from alliant in order to do eol trades as well as longer dated otc trades: 1. Written evidence that steve castleburg is an authorized signatory for each of the 3 utilities (and aecs - see below). 2. In addition, i would like for alliant energy corporate services to sign the consent and acknowledgment letter as well. I am not sure why a signature space was not provided for them on the document. Anyway - it is on our system and easy to generate a revised letter with a signature space for aecs. Also, as discussed, in order for us to give alliant the best credit line possible, here is our wish list, from most desirable downwards. What this means is that if alliant is willing to do #1- then they will get the best line possible. If they do #2, then the line will be somewhat decreased, and so on. 1. Separate eol applications and passwords for each individual utility who is appointing alliant as agent (i.e. A total of 3 individual passwords). Also a separate consent and acknowledgment for each will need to be signed by aecs and the relevant utility. 2. Alliant identifies at the time of transacting which utility the transaction is for. 3. Alliant sends us an allocation schedule at the end of each month which shows which transaction is for which utility. This is the procedure we follow with all utility agency relationships - we are not singling out alliant - i can promise you that., please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks, shari
