Yes, ena has changed its isda schedule form to provide for the "eligible contract participant" rep and line of business. I'll verify with susan bailey as to whether these changes have been subnitted to ectric. Rather than bombard you with lots of paper, please let me know what you would lilke to see regarding the new legislation. Please note that the act is very broad, extremely confusing (even to cftc "know-it alls") and addresses many types of derivatives (ag, equity, etc.) with some specificity.

Since the oslo office trades through ectric, i wonder whether this new piece of legislation has an impact on our standard reps relating to the "trade options exemption" and as to the parties being "eligible swap participants" (are they still required)? is there any internal memo yet prepared on the act and its implications? martin
