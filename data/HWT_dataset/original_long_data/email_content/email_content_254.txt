Fixed a bocimar vessel for our october commitment to electrabel from puerto bolivar to hunterston at $8.10 and also fixed another coeclerici vessel from colombia to rotterdam to cover our short to preag in november. Still have a late november short against cargill from richards bay to rotterdam to cover within the next couple weeks. On the abc front, met with elcano ( largest spanish shipping company ) to discuss a possible partnership to acquire abc but quickly realised that they do not have the stomach for such a big deal. However, did discover that they are quite active on the lng side and are about to close on a lng vessel purchase within the next couple weeks. We are definitely going to stay in contact to potentially develop some alliances on the lng side. Late in the week heard that bocimar had met with abc not to purchase them but to discuss a pooling agreement. From good sources were told that abc had no interest in bocimar's offer and therefore we are planning on meeting abc to continue to express our interest in acquiring their fleet and more importantly to continue to frustrate bocimars'attempt to control the cape fleet. We have completed our 'enron shipping' powerpoint presentation for eol and we expect to have a shipping section within the eol platform by mid next month in time for coaltrans. This new platform will allow our customers to log into eol and go directly to our shipping web page to be able to trade with us. Currently, customers have to access the international coal web page to access our shipping products which does not make sense to our customers also pierre met in paris with usinor ( 3rd largest steel mill in the world ) to discuss some potential freight deals and also express our interest to sell them synfuel next year to which they seemed quite interested. Will revert to them with prices shortly.
