Dperlin (non-privileged).pst please call me when you arrive. Thanks -----original message----- from: =09perlingiere, debra =20 sent:=09friday, october 19, 2001 5:11 pm to:=09mims, patrice l. Subject:=09central illinois confirm i would like to use the following for the flexible pricing. The last sen= tence regarding the keep whole verbiage i think you will want to delete th= is as it does not allow for force majeure. Flexible pricing: during the period of delivery for a transaction, custome= r may request a price other than the original contract price, being a fixed= price or (each below defined) by contacting company during pricing hours r= equesting any such price for a specified quantity of gas to be scheduled du= ring selected months within the period of delivery; provided, such request = must be made prior to 12:00 noon c.t. Of the last business day prior to the= last trading day of the nymex gas futures contract for the selected month.= a confirmation may be sent by company to customer confirming the flexible= pricing agreement in accordance with exhibit "a" "fixed price" means a fix= ed dollar amount agreed to by the parties. The price for all gas for which= a flexible price has not been agreed by the parties shall be the original = contract price applicable to the transaction. "notwithstanding anything to= the contrary contained in this confirmation or the gtc, upon customer's ac= ceptance of fixed price, customer shall keep whole and hold company harmles= s for all cost and expenses incurred by company with respect to the quantit= y of gas that is converted into a fixed price, in the event that such quant= ity of gas is not scheduled by customer for any reasons, including without = limitation events of force majeure. For the section "daily pricing for physical for physical call option" =20 daily pricing means the "daily midpoint" price set forth in gas daily platts, a division of the mcgraw-hill companies, or successor publication,= in the column "daily price survey" under the listing applicable to the geo= graphic location closest in proximity to the delivery point(s) for the rele= vant gas day. If there is no single "daily midpoint" price published for t= hat particular gas day, but there is published a "common" range of prices u= nder the above column and listing, then the spot price shall be the average= of such "common" high and low prices. In the event that no 'daily midpoin= t" price or "common" range of prices is published for that particular gas d= ay, then the spot price shall be the average of the following: the price (d= etermined as stated above) for each of the first gas day immediately preced= ing and following the gas day in which the default occurred for which a spo= t price can be determined. Let me know what you think. Dp debra perlingiere enron north america legal 1400 smith street, eb 3885 houston, texas 77002 debra.perlingiere@enron.com 713-853-7658 713-646-3490 fax
