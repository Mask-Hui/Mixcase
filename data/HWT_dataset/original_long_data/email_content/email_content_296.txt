We need to identify specifically what benefit we expect to derive from each phase and then from an overall standpoint, does this project have the highest priority from a revenue enhancement vs. Other projects on northern. I really want to emphasize the practical applications of each modeling effort and what the expected benefit is. We need to also evaluate whether the project sponsor (in this case the tw marketing staff) is fully behind the effort. We need to do everything that we can to get concrete results from our efforts. Let's discuss more tonight at dinner! thanks! kent lee ferrell 08/21/2000 06:00 pm to: kent miller/et&s/enron@enron cc: subject: tw modeling, forecasting and optimization kent, for discussion purposes on wednesday we would like to provide examples of possible revenue management application. Several existing and future tw projects have the potential to provide a platform to exploit revenue management concepts. The attached document provides a phased approach for this example. Our goal would be to obtain a critical mass on tw since it would be simple to model. We can also leverage the work that has been done on deal profitability and fuel forecasting. This is our first attempt to define a work product integrating our forecasting, optimization and revenue management resources. Let me know your thoughts. <embedded stdolelink>
