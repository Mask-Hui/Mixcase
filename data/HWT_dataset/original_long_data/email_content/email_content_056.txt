(i.e. One grand total of transactions for the east and west) -----original message----- from: pearce, barry sent: thursday, january 17, 2002 3:23 pm to: abel, chris; evans, casey cc: albrecht, kristin subject: re: information for the creditors committee what we want is active transactions, hence, how many deals do we have in the book as of 11/30? -----original message----- from: abel, chris sent: thursday, january 17, 2002 1:44 pm to: pearce, barry subject: fw: information for the creditors committee i thought i could answer this question. Can you provide more clarity? chris -----original message----- from: evans, casey sent: thursday, january 17, 2002 12:06 pm to: abel, chris subject: re: information for the creditors committee no, that can't be right, hence "clear as mud". We can have an "open" position overall with a counterparty or overall with a region, but there is no such thing as an "open" transaction?! -----original message----- from: abel, chris sent: thursday, january 17, 2002 11:32 am to: evans, casey subject: re: information for the creditors committee define it as open positions. If you have a long and a short offsetting with a counterparty, then there is not an open transaction.

I hope this helps clarify the request.

Please give us information (chris, keith, susie, susan and me) information as you get it. The first priority is the rolls supporting the dpr information. Also, please remember that all information needs to be reconciled to dpr information. Please let chris, keith & myself know of your time frame to get us this info. Currently, expectations are that we should have at least the rolls by the end of the week this week. << file: booket info needed.xls >> thanks shona wilson director, global risk operations x39123
