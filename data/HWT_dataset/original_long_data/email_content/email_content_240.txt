Kate symes 6-27-02.nsf these deals are all parts of sleeves we did for ees, and we only include a broker fee on the sale side of the sleeve. I ended up changing just two deals; they're highlighted in red: 459812 - no change (buy side of ees sleeve) 459813 - added .0075 broker fee (sale side of ees sleeve) 457489 - no change (buy side of ees sleeve) 457490 - no change (sale side already contained .0075 broker fee) 468444 - added .0075 broker fee (sale side) 468440 - no change (buy side) and as a disclaimer - i'm getting my information from our traders, so if any of this sounds incorrect, or if natsource still disputes, please let me know. Thanks, kate kerri thompson@enron 01/10/2001 12:07 pm to: kate symes/pdx/ect@ect cc: subject: natsource fees kate: these are some deals that i was waiting on revisions from the broker on the fees.
