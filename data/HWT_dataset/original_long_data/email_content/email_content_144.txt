We have used the following criteria to screen potential sites east of the mississippi including the following: underutilized existing coal fired generation (15 sites) existing coal fired generation that is on cold stand by (12 sites) coal units that have been retired (20 sites) coal fired units that at one time had planned coal unit additions that were delayed or cancelled (11 sites) undeveloped sites that had planned to build coal units (13 sites) undeveloped sites that had planned to build nuclear units (5 sites) we are in the process of prioritizing each site based on infrastructure, transmission access, market and permit status. That effort should be concluded this week and the study forwarded to you. We are also talking with two coal operators that are in the process of developing their own coal fired generation in kentucky and west virginia. We will keep you apprised of the progress and meet with you again as we move to the next stage.
