Jshankm.nsf i was planning on changing the morning meeting as you indicated. The problem with the p&l loss is one of time. We have given back 25 million this quarter, and very few traders took profits at any time. I expect traders to lose money at times, but we have other constraints. I'd be happy to have a call with you once we finish our budget process about how we will get to our numbers next year. Of course spread trading is a good idea, but when i look at the portfolio in aggregate, the position story i'm being told doesn't make sense. We'll get there.

I would suggest we move to traders telling what the main positions are in their books (3 max) and then give a bullish (max +2) to bearish (max -2) view of their mkt. If we moved more quickly through this we might have time for more meaningful discussion at the end. I think that the discussion at the end we can keep flexible but for instance when we have major issues like spr sales or an opec meeting we should delegate somebody to do a review of that. In terms of the wed meeting, unless there is something special, i would recommend letting the new research analyst we have hired in london do a quick api review. The issue of high volatility in the markets makes a good argument for lowering position sizes but the issue of not having any money to lose won't ever go away. I base that statement on the premise that with the budget for next year set at 175 million we will always be under pressure to meet budget and not give back any profits. The books that have historically made the most money in enron global products have been more spread trading/view oriented rather then flat price/momentum oriented. I know you would prefer we move away from this and become more the latter but i would encourage you to consider the fact that we have little edge in forecasting short term price movements but hopefully have enough staying power and experience to position ourselves correctly for the big moves.

I think it would be most prudent to play the markets from a very flat price position and try to day trade more aggressively. I have no intentions of outguessing mr. Greenspan, the us. Electorate, the opec ministers and their new important roles, the israeli and palestinian leaders, and somewhat importantly, mother nature. Given that, and that we cannot afford to lose any more money, and that var seems to be a problem, let's be as flat as possible. I'm ok with spread risk (not front to backs, but commodity spreads). The morning meetings are not inspiring, and i don't have a real feel for everyone's passion with respect to the markets. As such, i'd like to ask john n. To run the morning meetings on mon. And wed. Thanks. Jeff
