I don't believe it would be consistent with enron corp's policy to have a lawyer working for the business developer. Ect legal and ei legal need to get together to decide who brent should be reporting to, but i can assure you it should not be me. This is a seperate issue from who is covering brent's costs. I do believe he is under the argentine office's cost center since he is dedicating 100% of his time here. This is consistent with eisc's policy of allocating legal costs out to the business unit that is incurring the cost. However, i have had no input into brent's compensation or bonus and believe he considers himself to be reporting to ect legal.
