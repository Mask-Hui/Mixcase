Vkamins.nsf hi vince- i just got off the phone with rw and enron london. Alec told me that howard is idle and waiting for your command and the coordination of the directors. Melanie is working with vuthy rw directly on this for you and rachel quirk said she will contact you to set the time up..."unofficially" they were trying to do something with howard tomorrow as i was told- not sure. I have a couple other candidates i would like to send you after i collect some sleep ( 3;30 am now)- i'll send them to you after i wake. One guy from oxford, worked citibank fixed income risk the other over at ford motor company who is looking to move to london (highly recommended by the professor). I'll send them later as to let you be the judge. Talk soon- thanks for the business! jeff always held in strict confidence.
