Kmann.nsf just want you to know that i should be getting an epc form to work on from eecc re 9710. I didn't get to discuss this with j. Schwartzenburg on friday, since i didn't see him for after work on friday. I opted to see michael instead since i had been out of town. I've got the form break out contract for the lm 6000's. I'll get it ready for you to review re the esa deal. It will probably take me a few days to get it in shape to let it go. Hope you've had a great weekend. I don't think the weather could have been better.

Does that work for us from a timing pointof view? i know how you like to work weekends. Also too, and more important: are you up from drinks this evening? we are hoping you can break a tie between keffer (paper city) and me (roll-in).
