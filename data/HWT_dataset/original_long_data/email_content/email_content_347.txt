As of when? it might not be 8 hours old when they go to press so do we mean when it is being read? would it hurt to say something to the effect of "by the time you read this" as a lead in? are we sure that even this is accurate? how long from press run til the first copy hits the street? kal shah 08/07/2000 06:50 pm to: mark taylor/hou/ect@ect, mark palmer cc: subject: ads approval please provide approval of the following ads for global editions of the wall street journal and financial times. We are going to remove mention of enrononline being the only website in the world to reach $100 billion in eight months from the ad text. The rest of the ad copy will stay as is. We plan to run sometime beginning in september. Thanks
