The administration advised that if the situation warrants, they will indeed issue the order. This remains a fluid situation with richardson yesterday announcing his intent to "sign an order" which his staff had not yet written while in the interim bpa acted so as to make his announcement moot. We will continue to apprise you of the developments including reports of ferc's surprise site inspections.
