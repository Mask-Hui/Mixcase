Jdasovic.nsf this project, of all that have been proposed recently, probably has a better chance of success. First, mission energy is already a huge player in the ipp/cogen business in kern county, and is regarded as fairly skilled at getting permits/authorizations through the system. Their existing facilites on texaco's leases currently produce over 1,000 mw of power. Secondly, this project would sit smack dab in the middle of the midway-sunset field and is easily accessible off the west side lateral of kern/mojave's system. As such, they are probably a prime candidate for either phase i or phase ii of kern river's expansion. Also, realize that texaco has a substantial amount of field area [associated oil] gas, so, depending on the structure of the texaco - mission energy sales agreement, mission probably has access to or call on this texaco production (i.e., they have the perfect physical hedge). Kern would seem to be the "pipeline of choice" here... Particularly, when you consider the impact of the reduced rates under their proposed expansion. Without the direct connection into kern county, tw would have a difficult time competing. Also, keep an eye out for el paso moving forward with commercial plans for the california leg of all american pipeline. A large end-use plant like this could be the basis for an "en-rate" type transport program on el paso-all american, particularly if they get their allocation problems resolved at ferc. ---------------------- forwarded by jeffery fawcett/et&s/enron on 11/22/2000 08:56 am --------------------------- market intelligence - enron transportation services from: lorna brennan on 11/22/2000 08:48 am to: steven harris/et&s/enron@enron, jeffery fawcett/et&s/enron@enron, lorraine lindberg/et&s/enron@enron, kevin hyatt/et&s/enron@enron, christine stokes/et&s/enron@enron, tk lohman/et&s/enron@enron, michelle lokay/et&s/enron@enron, lindy donoho/et&s/enron@enron, lee huber/et&s/enron@enron, susan scott/et&s/enron@enron cc: subject: edison mission energy to build power plant in california edison mission energy, an edison international company, is purchasing the rights to the sunrise power project from texaco power and gasification. A proposed power generation facility to be located in kern county, calif., the project will bring both short- and long-term generation capacity to the state, which is in dire need of new power generation. The sunrise power project will be completed in two phases. Phase 1 will consist of a 320-mw, simple-cycle peaking facility scheduled to be in service during the summer of 2001. Phase 2 will convert the peaking facility to a 560-mw, combined-cycle operation with an in-service date of summer 2003. Final regulatory approvals should be received shortly for phase i of the project. Edison mission energy plans to seek expedited permitting approval for the phase ii expansion in line with the fast-track approvals process recently enacted by the california legislature. Edison mission energy specializes in the development, acquisition, construction management and operation of global power production facilities. The company owns nearly 23,000 mw of generating capacity, including interests in 75 projects currently under construction or operating in australia, indonesia, italy, new zealand, puerto rico, spain, thailand, turkey, the united kingdom and the united states.
