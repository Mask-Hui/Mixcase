Ridgewood states that the total power production capacity of qfs in california is approximately 9,000 mws, of which, between 4,000 and 5,500 mw are from qualifying cogeneration facilities (cogeneration qfs) and the remainder from small power production facilities (small power qfs). Ridgewood states that the cogeneration segment of the industry is underutilized because of operating efficiency and other qf requirements. With a limited waiver or other equivalent relief, ridgewood states that these underutilized resources could help relieve current shortages during both peak and off-peak periods. Ridgewood estimates that as much as 1,000 mws would be immediately available by allowing qfs to sell to the purchasing utility or into the competitive market their "above-baseline" output for a limited time period. Ridgewood suggests that any such sale would be made at market-based rates and would not be subject to the operating and efficiency standards......... Section 292.205(c) of the commission's regulations provides that the commission may waive any of its operating and efficiency standards "upon a showing that the facility will produce significant energy savings". However, the commission has exercised its waiver authority in a number of cases based on factors such as the limited durations of the requested waiver, whether further waivers would be necessary, whether the request was intended to remedy specific problems associated with an innovative technology, and whether granting waiver would fulfill purpa's goals. We find that many of these same factors are present here. Consistent with the goals of purpa, we find that granting such waiver in this circumstance will provide for increased efficiency in the use of the cogeneration facilities and improved reliability of electric service through increasing the availability of needed capacity. Therefore, we will grant temporary waiver of the operating and efficiency standards to cogeneration qfs for sales into california, effective as of the date of this order. We will terminate the waiver effective january 1, 2001." let me know if you want the entire order. Dan
