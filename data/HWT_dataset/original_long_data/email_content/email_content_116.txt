In my conversation today with kay, we talked about making sure we could at least recognize the $8mm in equal instalments between the execution of the letter agreement and september 1, 2001 (the outside date for closing). If at all possible, i'd like to take this one step further so that the entire amount could be recognized in q2. Let's plan to talk about this on monday. Any thoughts on this prior to monday would be appreciated. Regards, ben
