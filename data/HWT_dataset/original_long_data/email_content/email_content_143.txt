Joe parks 6-26-02.pst thanks for the contacts. Just to let you know we're already working with greg kaufman from fame (a collaboration of amerex and prebon). They're pulling together sample data for us to preview. Amerex - the day end quotes are limited in tenor (usually only out to oct. 2002) & joe parks already has copies of most of these reports. Prebon - same tenor problem as amerex. Don't know the status of the copies in-house. Apb - truequote - i'm already working with trevor atkins - we should get their data for free in the next couple of days supposedly the fame, transactional data is better than the amerex and prebon end of day quotes. The issue here will likely be data format more than content. I'll let you know once we hear back.
