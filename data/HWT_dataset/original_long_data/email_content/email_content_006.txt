Sscott5.nsf ben was actually already planning on going. In fact he informed me he would be bringing a friend from canada. Fyi - i didn't know there was a "friend" in canada until very recently (although i had my suspicions) and further more had never heard a name until today. Regardless, any friend of y'alls is a friend of mine. Also, nick is going to bring amy (his significant other). Should be an interesting evening.
