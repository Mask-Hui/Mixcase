Kpresto (non-privileged).pst the only issue i have is everytime i login i have some windows installer program i have to kill and it takes me an extra 2-3 minutes to keep closing files before i can get into my desktop. I don't know what caused this, but i am assuming some file you installed is still trying to run. In addition, the dial-up through citrix is very very slow. Is this normal? any thoughts? thanks for all your work - the printer works just fine -----original message----- from: muschar, daniel sent: wednesday, december 12, 2001 6:08 am to: presto, kevin m.
