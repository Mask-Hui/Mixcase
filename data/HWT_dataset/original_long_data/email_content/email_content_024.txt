Mtaylo1 (non-privileged).pst i made it back to houston last night. Incredible security at the airport in london -- it was a mob scene. In addition to the usual stuff there was an additional search of all carry-ons by hand at the gate and all passengers were patted down by a guard before entering the gate. I saw several passengers questioned on the plane about their checked luggage -- i couldn't really hear what it was all about. We were delayed about two and a half hours but it made it feel a little safer. The brits were all very nice of course while i was in london but it sure is good to be home.
