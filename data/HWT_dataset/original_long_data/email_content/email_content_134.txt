Rshapiro (non-privileged).pst the attached preliminary comments were finalized and filed with the commiss= ion this afternoon, in order to provide ferc staffers a concise, effective = statement of our position while they drafted the judge's recommendation. I= was able to schedule a meeting with judge wagner, at which dan watkiss and= i stepped the judge through the comments and hit the following high points= :=20 1. The methodology of the june 19 order does not work and is totally inapp= ropriate for marketers. If price mitigation is inevitable, the judge shoul= d formulate or make allowances for a workable methodology. 2. The judge should recommend that the end result of any commission order = must be a just and reasonable finding for all periods, both prior to and af= ter october 2. 3. All buyers, including enron, should be entitled to refunds; not just th= e state of california and its iou's. Enron is a net purchaser in these mar= kets. 4. Only the state administered spot markets should be subject to the metho= dology, not bilateral contracts, oom sales or sales to the dwr.=20 the details of these points appear in the attached document. The judge was= receptive to most points. He understood the problems that the june 19 met= hodology presents for marketers and was agreeable to the notion that this s= hould be addressed, perhaps in the context of the hearings that will form p= art of his recommendation. He agreed that the actual buyers should receive= refunds, and it was his understanding that only spot transactions should b= e subject to the refund methodology. Although he agreed that the refund me= thodology, once implemented, should yield just and reasonable rates, he fel= t that this was outside the scope of his recommendation and that the matter= was up to the commission. The judge spoke generally and no promises were = made as to the content of his recommendations, but hopefully this insight w= ill shed some light as to the outcome. I urged the judge to recommend plac= ing conditions to refunds, as the commission did in its june 19 order with = its rto filing requirement. The judge was noncommittal on this, although h= e did indicate that he felt refunds should be subject to offset. Next steps include filing our detailed comments by thursday. The judge tol= d us he would certify his recommendation to the commission on friday, and t= hat the comments would accompany the recommendation. Thereafter, it is lik= ely that the commission would defer to the judge's recommendation to hold a= fast track evidentiary hearing of 60 days duration, to determine "unresolv= ed issues of material fact". The scope of the hearing has not been determi= ned, but will probably include cost issues and might serve as a vehicle fo= r marketers to recommend an alternative methodology.
