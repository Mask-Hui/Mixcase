Kmann.nsf attached please find a clean copy of the most recent version of the city of austin agreement (the second document below), as well as a blackline showing changes from the last version circulated on december 14. The agreement deletes references to specific performance guarantees for combined cycle plants. The agreement now has the exhibits rolled in. To complete the agreement, we need to include the date of execution, the addresses and contacts for sections 25.1 and 25.3, and exhibit h-2. Let me know if you would like me to e-mail a copy of this directly to lee johnson and kent shoemaker. Please call when you have the opportunity to discuss the form agreement you asked me to create. <<cro- city of austin/ge facility agreement versions 3 to 4.doc>> <<gas turbine agreement draft of 12/13/00.doc>> - ge facility agreement versions 3 to 4.doc - 00.doc
