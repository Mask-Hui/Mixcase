I do not exactly know where ena's original went. Lets ask marty. To: brian d barto/enron_development@enron_development cc: subject: re: vitro/termination agreement i thought that someone retrieved the originals (which has been signed by ge but not enron) while i was in ft. Worth for my dad's surgery. Marty mentioned that you were looking for them, so i thought he had given them to you (he's out this week). I have not seen the termination agreement since i returned. Did you and john leave fully executed termination agreements in my office? maybe someone else picked them up. I can't tell you what's going on with the assignment. Perhaps peggy banczak can help out with that.

Yes, thankyou for asking, ge has received their fully executed original, and therefore should be prepared to issue the invoice to purchaser. But i have not seen the invoice yet. What is the status of the assignment of the ge contract to mitsui? did the invoice go to them? to: brian d barto/enron_development@enron_development, peggy banczak/hou/ect@ect cc: subject: vitro/termination agreement i haven't seen a signed copy of the termination agreement cross my desk. I just want to make sure that the fully executed document has been processed. Thanks, kay
