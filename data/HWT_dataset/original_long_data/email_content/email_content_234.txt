Consequently, elise and mike will be able to attend. More information on logistics to follow within two weeks. We will block off hotel rooms, etc. In the meantime. As with the last ase, it's an "all or nothing" proposition. Because of the structure of the event, participants must be there from start to finish (no partial attendance). We are still trying to get it to 2 days, but worst case we will set it so that people can fly up tuesday morning and fly back thursday night. I am looking forward to everyone's participation and input.thanks!
