Klay (non-privileged).pst ============================================================ crossfire at 7:30 p.m. Et on january 8, 2002 and online at cnn.com/crossfire ============================================================ from cnn's crossfire staff: tonight in the crossfire... The u.s. Justice department is putting top priority on tracking down 6,000 "deportable aliens" of middle eastern and arab descent. Is it racial profiling to target one ethnic group for ejection? shouldn't all aliens who have overstayed their visas or violated rules be treated equally? could this measure help prevent future terrorist attacks, or is it a violation of individual rights? after sept. 11th and given the common characteristics of the hijackers, is it justified to apply added scrutiny to those who fit the same profile? former deputy attorney general george terwilliger argues that profiling may be necessary in the war on terrorism while wade henderson of the leadership council on civil rights says individuals of certain backgrounds shouldn't be singled out by law enforcement. It should make for a heated debate. Join bill press and robert novak tonight on crossfire, 7:30pm eastern, 4:30 pacific. On cnn.
