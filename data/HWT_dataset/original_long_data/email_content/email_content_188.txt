Brogers.nsf hi everyone. Hope you all had a great thanksgiving. We had a great time in chicago and are waiting to see if it will happen again next year :-) just kidding michaela! okay, we need everyone to put in their wish lists so some of us can start our shopping. Please try and give a couple of suggestions for yourselves-not just one-in case we can't get something! also, i don't think all adults have put in suggestions for their children. Once again, is it $125.00 per couple and $30.00 for children?????? also, what about the gift for mom and dad?? hope to hear from you all soon! megan by the way, some suggestions for ben and i--- anything we registered for that we didn't get (ross-simons) any spode stuff (except glasses) i'll think of some other stuff __________________________________________________ do you yahoo!? yahoo! shopping - thousands of stores.
