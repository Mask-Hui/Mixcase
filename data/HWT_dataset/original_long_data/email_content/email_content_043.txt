Jsteffe (non-privileged).pst mike smith and jim steffes just phoned and indicated that the california iso may require us to post $5mm in collateral today to cover deliveries to our california customers. We are attempting to have them net this request with approximately $50mm of monies they owe us. This payment will allow us to remain a scheduling coordinator for the first 5 days of december. If we do not pay the iso will decertify us and the utilities (pg&e, sce and sdg&e) can immediately execute thier right to return our customers to utility service. We have a transaction pending to sell a large portion of the contracts under the iso that could be worth as much as $150mm. If the utilities return the customers to utility service we will not have a book to sell. Mike or jim, if i have missed anything or misstated anything, please reply to all. I will keep you posted, but wanted to get the word to you as soon as i heard. Thanks wade
