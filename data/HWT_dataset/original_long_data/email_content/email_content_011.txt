Tdonoho.nsf tom: i tried to leave you a message about what happened on the last cycle for gas day 9 but your voicemail at the office didn't work.; grand chenere compressor went down by 100,000mm in total late saturday night. This affected 20,000 of supply coming from hios and 14,000 se transmission pool purchases. I was able to make up 15,195 on the 10th. By increasing our hios nom and paying back pg&e. Anr said the compressor is back up now however with shippers doing makeup this could cause more capacity cuts for the 12th. I'll be back tomorrow, i've got jury duty today. W&t left me a messge at the office that they went down but they didn't page me so we were cut 2,982 at ss207 over the weekend;which also cut our se tran. Markets. I've taken them down to 1 unless you'd like to shut them in ( deal498384). Mark 713-905-9622 pager kirk- shawn at duke said he cut us at n.maumee(ml7) by 1000, see if our mkt. Wants makeup for 12th.
