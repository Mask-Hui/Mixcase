Kate symes 6-27-02.nsf i just talked to chris about this. Apparently, the reliant trader thought he was clicking an sp-15 trade, and called immediately afterward to ask chris if it could be adjusted. It was more lucrative for chris to do this deal at sp-15 than np-15 anyway, so he agreed. I guess i'm unclear about the exact eol guidelines in a situation like this, but please let me know if there's anyone you'd like me to talk to. Chris didn't have the trader's name offhand, but i could probably get him to research it a bit more. Just let me know what you need from us.

When it was done on line the delivery point was np-15 now in enpower it has been changed to sp-15. Could you check with chris if this is correct. I thought that we were not allowed to change eol trades. If he did then i will have to get with legal to find out what our next step would be. Thanks, kimberly enron power marketing, inc.
