Since that time, we have completed a merger with one of our primary competitors, launched our bulk shipping/e-chartering exchange and now have begun trading on the site. We currently have support from charterers representing approximately 10% of the global petroleum shipping spot market volume and from ship owners representing approximately 15% of the large tanker fleet. I saw that enron announced last month its entry into the freight futures market for bulk petroleum shipping. Given this event and our marketplace momentum, i thought it may make sense to have a more strategic discussion around possible opportunities between enron and sealogistics. Please let me know your interest in discussing further a potential joint opportunity. Best regards, brad w.
