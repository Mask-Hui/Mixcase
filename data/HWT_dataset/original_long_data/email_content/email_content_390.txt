Vkamins.nsf martin, thanks. Vince from: martin lin on 03/22/2001 04:46 pm to: vince j kaminski/hou/ect@ect cc: subject: re: summer internship i did not find anybody in ebs who seems to know or be involved in any e-procurement issues. In enron corp, however, there is an initiative called ibuyit. This is a system that corp is deploying for e-procurement through corp and ena, and will get to ebs sometime late this year. John gillespie is in charge of the ibuyit initiative. Perhaps he is the appropriate contact. I left a voice mail with him, but have not yet received a response. Martin vince j kaminski 03/22/2001 07:17 am to: martin lin/hou/ect@ect cc: subject: summer internship martin, please, take a look at question 3. Who is the right person at ebs? vince ---------------------- forwarded by vince j kaminski/hou/ect on 03/22/2001 07:16 am --------------------------- jinbaek kim <jinbaek@ieor.berkeley.edu> on 03/15/2001 01:12:32 am to: vince.j.kaminski@enron.com cc: subject: summer internship dr. Kaminski, sorry for the late response, it took me some time to coordinate things. Finally, it's almost dont :-) it turned out that from june to august will be best for me for work at enron (say june.4 to august.4) but i still need to know several things from your side. Could you answer following questions? first: is my suggested working period is ok with you? if so, let me know what to do for settlement during the period. Second: i got a list of work, i might be able to do for dealbench team from ross and suresh. I'd like to know it is still a valid work list: the list he sent is as following: > 1. Write a paper in layman's terms that answers > questions like the following: > benefits of auctioning online for both buyers and > sellers, particularly in reverse auctions > explanation how multi-variable auctions are not > as efficient as price-only auctions (is this true?) > how many participants are recommended for a > successful live auction > what types of goods and services are best suited > for live auctions versus sealed bid quotes > opinions on lotting strategies > trends in online private auctions > 2. Identify appropriate recent auction research (3 > or 4 papers out of the 90+ you provided)and obtain approvals from the > authors to post on our site > 3. Create a list/bibiliography of relevant auction > literature (with hyperlinks?) > 4. Would you be willing to offer auction consulting > services to our customers (if they are interested) third: there is an e-procurement forum at haas school of business, in may 22. The chair of the forum is my advisor prof. Arie segev. A person from wells fargo bank will talk about wells fargo's role in e-marketplace payment initiative, where enron broadband services is also one of key players along with citibank. He asked me whether you can contact a person at enron broadband services, who's related to the initiative. He wants to know whether we will have a speaker from enron to see enron's perspective, in the forum. Here is a link to news related to the initiative, http://www.internetweek.com/story/inw20000808s0001 fourth: my advisor wants to know whether there could be any opportunity to do a case study, regarding enron's business. He is interested in e-procurement and e-marketplaces. Business model and system architecture... Thanks for reading this long email. I'll look forward to your answer.. I am sorry for giving you so much burden to answer those questions possibly not easy to answer.
