Scorman (non-privileged).pst i was referring to the fact that bearpaw is an actual marketing affiliate of nng and is posted as such on the website. Bearpaw has a transport contract on nng. -----original message----- from: cordes, bill sent: monday, october 08, 2001 4:54 pm to: horton, stanley; corman, shelley; hartsoe, joe subject: bearpaw marketing affiliate i want to clarify something from our reg roundtable earlier today. Bearpaw is currently a "potential marketing affiliate" of nbpl, and so far has not crossed the line to actually trigger an event that would make them a full fledged ma. We are careful not to trigger such an event. Bearpaw may be a ma of nng due to some contract activity on nng, but that is not a problem for nbpl. Shelly, if you see it differently, please let me know. Bill
