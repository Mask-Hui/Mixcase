Mhaedic.nsf let's catch up when you get back to houston. We can go to lunch or set up time to meet in the office.

I understand that the length is still probably more than you want -- we will keep working on winnowing it down. I tended to leave in more discussion of troubled projects like seclp and dabhol. I hope all is well. I've been on the road for some time and am currently in singapore. I'm likely to head back to bombay for at least the first few days of next week. Bruce
