O. Box 26530, austin, texas 78755 - phone 512-795-8536 cedric benson commits to ut; brown says qb derby too close to call record-breaking midland lee rb cedric benson, 5-11, 200, 4.5, committed to the longhorns thursday night, lee coach john parchman said friday. Parchman said benson called ut assistant coach mike tolleson thursday night and told him he wanted to play for the longhorns. Benson was in el paso for a scrimmage friday night, but his mother confirmed the commitment. Tolleson, who coaches defensive tackles, is the longhorn assistant who recruits west texas. Benson is the 13th commitment for the longhorns this recruiting season, and he certainly is the most famous after rushing for 3,526 yards and 44 touchdowns last season. He scored seven other touchdowns on pass receptions for a grand total of 51 tds. No class 5a back in texas has ever accounted for as many yards or touchdowns as benson did in leading midland lee to a state title and an undefeated season in 1999. Gordon wood, possibly the greatest high school coach in texas history after leading stamford and brownwood to multiple state championships before retiring several years ago, says benson "is the best running back i have ever seen in high school." wood's teams had some great backs and they played against some other great backs, so that is high praise indeed. Benson is on all the national top 100 lists as are fellow texas pledges jonathan scott of dallas carter and abe robinson of houston jersey village, both offensive linemen. Ol alfio randall of blinn jc, another texas commitment, was a national top 100 prospect two years ago at houston yates. Randall, by the way, had hoped to enroll at texas in january, but he needs 24 more hours at blinn, so he will have to remain at the junior college through the spring semester to graduate. That will delay his enrollment at texas until next fall. The longhorns' other early commitment are offensive linement terrance young of longview, mike garcia of galena park, roman reeves of livingston and will allen of houston cypress falls; middle linebacker yamil lebron of killeen ellison, wide receiver-defensive back brian carter of the woodlands, cornerback cedric griffin of san antonio holmes, safety kendal briles of frenship and defensive back-outside linebacker braden johnson of euless trinity. Briles, a great option quarterback in high school, led stephenville to the class 4a state title last year by passing for 3,115 yards and 28 touchdowns and running for 1,331 yards and 16 more tds. So, between benson and briles, the longhorns have early commitments from two young men who accounted for more than 8,000 yards and 95 touchdowns while leading their teams to the state championships in the two largest classifications in texas. So far, only seven member of dave campbell's texas football magazine's 24-man super team have committed to colleges, and the longhorns have six of them. Benson is the only high school player ever to grace the cover of the state's top football magazine and he is joined on the super team by briles, griffin, scott, young and robinson. The other super team player who has committed is madisonville running back david underwood, who says he will sign with michigan. * * * * coach mack brown said friday qb major applewhite appears to be completely recovered after undergoing off-season knee surgery, and he said he and chris simms "are both outstanding quarterbacks," adding, "honestly, i think both of them will play in the nfl." but he said he isn't ready to name a starter for the season opener and might not name one until the game starts. "they are really good," he said. "it looks like major is going to be healthy. We really didn't know how healthy he was going to be, but his knee has held up fine so far." asked when he plans to name one to be the starter against louisiana-lafayette, he said, "i may not." once, when he was coaching at north carolina, brown didn't announce a starting quarterback until the season started and he sent his starting team out on the field for its first possession. That could happen again this year. * * * * injury notes: freshman dt stevie lee returned to practice friday and looked fine after suffering a slight leg injury thursday. * * * * practice notes: brown has canceled saturday's afternoon practice. The team will scrimmage at 9 a.m. Saturday, then take the rest of the day off. * * * * my next fax will be whenever events warrant. * * * * the true orange fax service includes at least 99 faxes a year and costs $99 ($79 by e-mail).
