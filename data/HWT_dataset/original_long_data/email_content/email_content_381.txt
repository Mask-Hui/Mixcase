Energy company abandons plans for baldwin hills plant=20 power: homeowners and environmentalists rejoice at decision. The site is=20 proposed as a 1,200-acre state park.=20 by joe mozingo, times staff writer=20 ?????in a victory for environmentalists and nearby homeowners, an energy=20 company announced thursday that it was abandoning its plan to build a power= =20 plant on the site of a proposed state park in the baldwin hills.=20 ?????la jolla energy development inc., in a letter to the state energy=20 commission, said it was withdrawing its application for fast-track approval= =20 of the 53-megawatt plant and "will not pursue the baldwin facility in the= =20 future." ?????"we listened to the community," la jolla president steve wilburn said = in=20 an interview thursday. "we need to find another place for this equipment." ?????the project was to be a joint venture between la jolla and stocker=20 resources, an oil company that leases the land where the trailer-sized=20 natural-gas plant would sit. ?????stocker officials said they will decide in the next few days whether= =20 they will pursue the project. "at this point it's just la jolla pulling out= ,"=20 stocker spokesman steve rusch said. ?????but most observers said it would be difficult to move forward on the= =20 fast-track schedule the state has implemented to relieve the energy crisis. ?????the state commission was scheduled to decide whether to approve the=20 project today in sacramento, but the hearing has been canceled. ?????the news sparked elation among environmentalists and nearby homeowners= =20 who had fought the proposal on grounds that it would pollute neighborhoods= =20 and threaten an ambitious plan to piece together 1,200 acres of public open= =20 space in the hills. ?????"we're getting ready to have the biggest party," said tony nicholas,= =20 president of the hills' united homeowners assn. "this shows how a community= =20 can come together for a common goal and mobilize the people in a matter of= =20 days." ?????about 76% of the residents in the hills are african american and many= =20 saw the issue as a matter of environmental justice.=20 ?????in addition, stocker and la jolla were seeking approval for the plant= =20 within 21 days of filing their application, under the governor's emergency= =20 power orders. By following this fast-tracked procedure, they would have bee= n=20 able to avoid the normal, time-consuming environmental review process. ?????that angered opponents even further, and nearly 1,000 people showed up= =20 at a public hearing monday to fight the project. ?????but what officials said turned the tide against the project--at a time= =20 when the energy commission is approving such plants as fast as possible--wa= s=20 testimony from a south coast air quality management official who said his= =20 agency would not be able to approve the plant quickly. ?????executive director barry wallerstein said his agency would have to=20 conduct hearings that would take up to 60 days, pushing construction well= =20 beyond a sept. 30 deadline set by the governor for fast-track projects. He= =20 also said it was unlikely stocker could get needed exemptions from federal= =20 clean air laws. ?????in a letter to the energy commission this week, wallerstein wrote: "it= =20 appears that the baldwin energy facility could not begin operation until so= me=20 time in the first part of 2002 at the earliest." by wednesday night, the=20 energy commissioner who presided over the public hearings issued a statemen= t=20 recommending that the rest of the commission deny the application for a=20 plant, citing wallerstein's concerns. ?????conservationists embraced the outcome as a sign that the movement to= =20 create a park was gaining steam. The baldwin hills conservancy was created= =20 last year with the idea of creating green space for the densely populated= =20 neighborhoods of south los angeles. With support from the governor and loca= l=20 politicians, the state recently bought a 68-acre parcel in the area for an= =20 unprecedented $41 million. ?????"this is a great day for the baldwin hills and all the people who have= =20 worked so hard to bring this world-class vision to reality," said esther=20 feldman, president of community conservancy international and the main=20 organizer to build the park. ?????also applauding la jolla's decision were state sen. Kevin murray=20 (d-culver city) and assemblyman herb wesson (d-culver city), who had come o= ut=20 strongly against the project. They and others questioned whether the small= =20 amount of power provided by the facility--coming online after the dog days = of=20 summer--would do much to relieve the energy crisis. ?????"i'm ecstatic" wesson said. "at this point the environment has won." ?????the plant would have sat on what is a working oil field about 650 feet= =20 from the kenneth hahn state recreation area. And according to park=20 proponents, it would lie in the middle of the grander state conservancy, on= =20 what would be a half-mile bridge of land arching over la cienega boulevard. ?????rusch, the spokesman for stocker, said much of the information=20 circulating about the trailer-sized plant is false. ?????the plan did not call for "a stack with billowing smoke," he said. "if= =20 the issue is air quality, we've cleaned air quality up." in the last decade= ,=20 rusch said, the company's existing 400 oil pumps on the property have reduc= ed=20 nitrogen oxide emissions from 374 tons to 3 tons a year. The power=20 plant--with two 70-foot stacks--would ultimately add about 18 tons a year. ?????he said the company was trying to cut its energy bills by providing it= s=20 own power to pump oil, while also contributing an extra 39 megawatts to the= =20 state grid during the energy crisis. ?????residents say there are more desolate places for the state to relieve= =20 the energy problem.
