Jshankm (non-privileged).pst tonight in andersen at 6pm is your chance to learn how to turn your great business ideas into $$$'s. We think that the student-led, student run uc berkeley business plan competition track record speaks for itself: * earlier this year the competition's first winner, timbre technologies, sold to tokyo electron for $138 million * to date, the competition has helped entrepreneurs raise over $100 million in vc funding so, if you have a business idea, if you want to find someone with another business idea, or you just want to find out more because you are simply interested, head to andersen auditorium at 6pm tonight and learn how you can become the next big thing. Best regards the 2002 uc berkeley bplan competition organizing committee
