Kate symes 6-27-02.nsf hello, i just spoke with holly at raphael house. She said that the meeting on thursday, nov. 2, will be at 6 pm at the downtown marriott (1041 sw naito-within walking distance from here). The meeting will be held on the ballroom level, which is one floor below the lobby. If you are interested in the 8 am - noon or noon - 4 pm shifts on saturday, you are encouraged to attend this meeting. If you cannot make the meeting, then just show up at those times on saturday. I plan on going to the meeting on thursday, so let me know if you're interested in going together. Thanks again and hopefully this is the last e-mail! ;0 anna
