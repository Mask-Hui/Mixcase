Keavey, peter f..pst please respond to feedbackromance in paradise! dear peter, everyone has their own definition of paradise. For some it's unspoiled beaches and lush tropical jungle. For others it's a more developed resort. For others, it's not about the outdoors at all--if you're one of those people who thinks a place called "sin city" sounds just about perfect, we can help you, too. However you like it, travelocity can help make it happen. Whether you're traveling with your sweetie, or just into the romance of traveling, travelocity can help you plan and book the perfect trip. And that sounds like paradise to us.
