Mgrigsb.nsf dear jeff, i am interested in summarizing all of our contracts in the western region and identifying any problems (i.e. Penalty language, notification deadlines for ofos, etc.) that may need to be addressed. We have experienced a few problems with sw gas corp. Recently. They have been penalizing enron for cuts on epng, but when we pursued penalties with them on a baseload one month deal last month, they claimed that all one month deals have been booked on an interruptible contract and cannot be penalized. This was news to me. Can you help me identify what types of contracts we are using to transact business with our customers in the west? i can honestly say that these contracts have not been reviewed by the west desk for some time. Phillip allen transferred the desk to me in august of 2000 and i have not spent the time to review all of contracts. Let's get together and discuss exactly what i may need. Sincerely, mike grigsby x37031
