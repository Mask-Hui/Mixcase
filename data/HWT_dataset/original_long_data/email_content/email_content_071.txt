Lcampbel (non-privileged).pst today, enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview = of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call. We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter= ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit= y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe= ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses. It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot = of significant events that led to our current situation: -- in hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co= re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in azu= rix, india and brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve= r imagined when we made these investments; -- because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa= ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex= tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet; -- we also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in= vestor confidence, which has been very damaging; -- we've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under= stand financial and operating disclosures; and -- on top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d= iscussed in our 8-k filing last week, that required a restatement of previo= usly reported earnings. We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three= areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review. Core businesses our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear= nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th= ese include: -- natural gas pipeline businesses; -- gas and power businesses in north america and europe; -- retail businesses in north america and europe; and -- coal businesses in north america and europe. The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou= r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti= me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering= these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002= . I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple = of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity = concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i= mprovement in our counterparty relationships. Non-core businesses our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d= ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the= return from them has been dismal. We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect = that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash= that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre= ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th= ey include ceg rio, a gas ldc in brazil; ecoelectrica, a power plant and ln= g receiving terminal in puerto rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga= s properties in india. The approximately $2.9 billion portland general sale= is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals. Businesses under review these businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga= s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev= eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete= rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff= icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation. Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make= reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b= ecomes available. Credit rating/10-q filing we continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that = our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba= lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr= edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows: -- moody's at baa3 "under review for further downgrade" -- fitch at bbb- "evolving status" -- s&p at bbb- "creditwatch negative" we also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including osprey, marlin= and yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1= 0-q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on nov. = 19. We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we= ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference = call will be filed with the securities and exchange commission in the next = few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve= stors under "sec filings." =20 =20 in connection with the proposed transactions, dynegy and enron will file a = joint proxy statement/prospectus with the securities and exchange commissio= n.
