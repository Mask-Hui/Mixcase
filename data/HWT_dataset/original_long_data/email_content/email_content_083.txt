Tjones.nsf thanks. Do we still have the materials from the workshop that could be forwarded to jane? mark taylor 10/25/2000 04:55 pm to: alan aronowitz/hou/ect@ect cc: tana jones/hou/ect@ect subject: re: isda master documentation workshop unfortunately euromoney is no longer offering their courses. They were by far the best around and it's a real shame. There is a pli course being offered in ny in mid november (at which i'm speaking on commodity derivatives) and isda has a conference in london on collateral arrangements and the isda credit support documents. Neither is anywhere near as good as the old euromoney courses but both would probably benefit jane.

Please advise. Thanks.
