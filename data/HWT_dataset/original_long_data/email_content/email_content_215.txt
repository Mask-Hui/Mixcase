Ddavis2.nsf hi denise, did carolyn call you last night regarding candis' hotel slumber party?

The directions are 45s or 59s to 610e. 601e to wayside. Exit wayside and turn left under 610. Take wayside to birmingham and turn right on birmingham. Birmingham dead ends into the church. Try and be there on time, because the church fills up pretty quickly. Also remember the seeds of praise workshop on saturday from 9:00 am to 2:00 pm at mt. Corinth umc in humble. Take 1960 towards humble. Take the "y" in the road when going into humble onto old humble road. The church is about 1 to 1 1/2 miles down on the right. If you pass super k-mart on the left, turn around you have gone to far. Breakfast will be served promptly at 9:00 am. I have already paid for all members going from veterans, so we can settle up later. Don't forget the picnic is on sunday after service.
