I have tentatively offered to include as part of the meeting a tour of the enron gas control room (can you do that, james?) for chairman garza and a small number of people from the group (maybe about a dozen). We would like a larger number of representatives from companies which are members of the group to attend the general informal discussion with chairman garza, probably at either the enron building, the met, or otherwise nearby. Tentative dates are june 23 and june 30, probably in the middle of the day with lunch. Please let me know whether or not you would like to attend the meeting, and if so what date(s) work for you, and i will pass the information on to roxann neumann, who is coordinating the meeting. If you think any others would like to attend, give me a call (36417) or cc:mail.
