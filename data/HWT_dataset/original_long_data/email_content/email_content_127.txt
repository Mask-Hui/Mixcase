The response times from peco, pricewaterhousecoopers and other high speed internet connections have been very slow (sometimes 5 minutes or more to retrieve a single 10-15 page text document). It would help us greatly in our due diligence efforts if this material could be made available on cd rom as has often been done with other deals we have been involved with. Please advise if this is possible and if so, when the cd's would be available.

The purchase and sale agreement ("psa") for each asset has now been posted to dealbench under the new document section. Please review the instructions attached to each psa. 2. The management presentations (with audio) have now been posted to dealbench under the management presentation(strikethrough: s) section. When attempting to view the presentation, please log onto dealbench using microsoft internet explorer. Once in dealbench, you will most likely need to download "flash player" (free download). You can do this by clicking "macromedia flash player download center" in the linked documents section of dealbench. The download usually takes less than 30 seconds. After the download, return to the management presentation section of dealbench and click on the management presentation (with audio). A power point presentation has also been included in the management presentation section of dealbench. A detailed instruction guide "instruction for viewing management presentation" has been posted in new document section of dealbench. 3.
