Sshackle.nsf bill: i am resending my earlier message which identifies the correct legal entities with which enron corp. Would like to execute isda master agreements (for the purpose of entering into equity trades). In addition to the entities listed below, we need to include "merrill lynch international" ("mli"). Ena just negotiated an agreement with mli, so the enron corp. Master should be fairly simple. Also, clint and jeff are interested in transacting with toronto dominion bank. In that regard i note that enron has an interest rate and currency agreement with toronto dominion bank, new york branch. I'll review this agreement to see if it requires amendment. Jeff/clint: do want to deal with a specific toronto dominion branch? all: i will expect that bill will provide credit worksheets and i'll either begin the isda process or change "ena" to enron corp. On those agreements which have previously been sent. Thanks. Let me know if you have any questions.

Isda master agreements all: before rod became a brit, we were working with enron corp. Treasury to put in place some masters in the name of ena for the following parties: bear, stearns internaitonal limited credit agricole indosuez csfb international lehman brother finance s.a. Morgan stanley capital services inc. Deutsche bank these masters will be used to for equity deals on ene stock. The treasury group has concluded together with rex rogers and v&e, that enron corp. Is the appropriate swap counterparty for these masters and not ena. Who in credit will be available to assist me in this process? thanks. Sara
