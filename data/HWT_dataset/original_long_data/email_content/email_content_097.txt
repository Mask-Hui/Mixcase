In an > effort at compromise, pg&e neg (otay mesa) proposed a "double pro rata > gas curtailment" plan for parties to consider. Under this plan, eg's > (excepting cogenerators) would be curtailed on a pro rata basis within the > eg class based upon scheduled eg demand. This would be classified as a > step 1 allocation.

The parties pointed out to the alj > that comments filed by sdg&e and socalgas on the oii and in > representations made in the courtroom today failed to include sempra or > its pipeline affiliate as a respondent. They also noted that many of the > issues they were concerned with dealt specifically with communications > between sempra and its affiliates. The alj noted that "good form required > a respondent to cooperate and appear" . Sempra argued that sdg&e and > socalgas were the only entities owning and operating gas transmission and > distribution facilities in california, not the parent or the pipeline > company. Alj bushy ended this discussion quickly and noted that sempra > was a respondent and should enter an appearance and the sempra attorney > reluctantly agreed. > > more important were the comments of commissioner bilas.
