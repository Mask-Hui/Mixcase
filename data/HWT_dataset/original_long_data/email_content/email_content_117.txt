This is incorrect in probably all cases, and i need your assistance in drafting a cover letter to help clarify hpl's position to cps as to our ability to perform, and more so, our contractual obligation to perform relative to this proposed contract draft. All this contract does is agree that hpl will allow the facilities they are requesting to be installed, subject to tejas gas' approval (jv responsibility), at their cost. There is no commitment to flow any volume of gas on any basis under this agreement. Any such obligation would have to be negotiated and agreed to in writing separately. Please provide draft response. If you have any questions, please call.
