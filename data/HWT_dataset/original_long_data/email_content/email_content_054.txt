I don't have a current list of all the desk leads, so i thought that i'd ask you to forward this message on to them for me. I know that the eol group is still working on a solution to our problem, but there are still deals that are in houston books that need to be flipped. Please let me know if there is anything i can help with. Thanks for your help on this. Stacey
