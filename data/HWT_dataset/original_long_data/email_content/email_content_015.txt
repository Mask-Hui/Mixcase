Mark guzman 6-28-02.nsf we have some new opportunities with modesto irrigation district in northern california. Mid is their own schedule coordinator (sc id for caps -- mid1), and has a very flexible system that we can frequently help them run more efficiently. Mid has partial ownership in san juan, and can buy in the sw at pv or mead 230(some wheels to san juan may be needed). Mid also has the capability to buy/sell in the sw or at capt jack in the nw and then buy/sell respectively with us in np-15. Mid's real time # is 1-209-527-3185, the rt guys at mid are not marketers, they are system reliability folks(dispatchers like epe--old school), be aware and prepared for this when talking to them. If we are going to make use of their system flexibility, we should set it up well ahead of time with blair jackson(209-526-7505) or matt ray(209-527-8001), it also would likely be helpful to reference these two when talking to the dispatchers.
