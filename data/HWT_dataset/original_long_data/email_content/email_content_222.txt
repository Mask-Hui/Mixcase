Mtaylo1 (non-privileged).pst thanks morris. We will go on confirming these deals. Peter. -----original message----- from: =09clark, morris =20 sent:=09tuesday, june 26, 2001 12:37 pm to:=09keohane, peter; hedstrom, peggy; seib, dianne; scott, laura subject:=09re: financial confirms peter, the usage of rmt is driven by a state tax planning structure that was imple= mented in 1997/1998. Simply put, by intermediating intercompany trades thr= ough rmt we are able to lower enron's texas franchise tax significantly (in= fact, since rolling out the rmt structure we were able to reverse state in= come tax reserves of approximately $50-60mm). =20 the texas franchise tax is essentially a "pseudo" income tax that applies t= o all companies doing business in the state of texas. Under the tax, texas= sourced receipts are taxed at a rate of 4.25%. Income from intangible pro= perty (ie. Income from trading contracts) is sourced based on the "location= of the payor". In the case of corporations, the location of the payor or = legal domicile is where the mind and management of the company is located. = (obviously, for ena and most of the domestic enron affiliates the legal do= micile is texas). Thus, prior to rmt, all trades between ena and the domes= tic affiliates were sourced to texas for franchise tax purposes (which trad= es were numerous as ena was the risk management center for the enron family= ). Rmt was established as a delaware corporation with absolutely no contac= ts with texas (ie. Mind and management in delaware) with a business purpose= of consolidating all of enron's risk management activities. By utilizing = rmt as the counterparty on affiliate trades we are able to source a signifi= cant portion of ena's income away from texas (and suprisingly enough, into = delaware -- which does not have an income based franchise tax). The tension with the rmt structure is on the "business purpose". In other = words, we need to be very careful that we can show that rmt is acting as a = true risk consolidating entity for enron (thus, the reason for using rmt fo= r international affiliates--including ecc). With this in mind, we need to = document the trades with rmt meticulously (must show that we document simil= arly to what we do with third parties), including confirming all of the tra= des. While i can appreciate that this causes quite a bit of administrative= burden, i think we should continue to confirm with rmt until we can show t= hat it is no longer enron's business practice to send out confirms. (just = fyi -- we just successfully completed a texas franchise tax audit which uph= eld the integrity of rmt, but only after providing details as to how rmt pr= operly documented the intercompany transactions). Sorry to be so long winded, but i thought you could appreciate some of the = background. Please give me a call so that we can discuss further. Thanks.

If tax and audit is ok, we can do away with rmt/ena confirms. Morris/laura= ? with respect to eol transactions and doing away with confirms for certain c= ounterparties, you will see from mark's note that this is still a work in p= rocess, and confirms still need to go out. Mark: i thought there was only one mark taylor - i will leave it to others= to determine whether it is a good or bad thing that there are two of you k= icking around. If i were you i would tell it to back off and then try arb = hr by using the confusion to receive to paychecks. I am happy to help re: = canadian law if you want to look into an agreement re: the eol confirms for= designated canadian counterparties. Peter. =20 -----original message----- from: =09taylor, mark =20 sent:=09tuesday, june 26, 2001 11:36 am to:=09keohane, peter subject:=09re: financial confirms regarding the need for the rmt confirms, i have always thought this was rea= lly a tax issue and that for audit purposes they were needed. If that is n= ot the case, i don't object to doing away with them altogether. We have approved doing away with confirms for eol trades on a counterparty = by counterparty basis. We haven't actually gotten there with anyone yet, h= aving just started the actual discussions this week. Our plan was to negot= iate an written agreement with each affected counterparty to amend the mast= er agreements where appropriate. Initially we are only working on physical= power, physical natural gas and derivatives transactions (other than weath= er). The idea is that a lawyer from each affected group would be involved = to insure that all of the bases are properly covered. This will obviously = be a very time-consuming and laborious process. The initial list of 10 or = 15 counterparties to approach was selected by the back office people. Our = conclusion that this was even possible was based only on texas and new york= law analysis. If any canadian deals are at issue, we will need to get you= involved both for the analysis and the negotiations. Hope this is helpful. Let me know if it makes sense to you. Mark p.s. -- please be careful when sending e-mails to me. There are two mark t= aylors and we're hard to tell apart. The other guy has his middle initial = ("a") in some of the lists and sometimes there is a globe next to his name,= but not mine. My name usually has my phone number next to it. We're tryi= ng to get the it people to do something to better distinguish us. -----original message----- from: =09taylor, mark =20 sent:=09monday, june 25, 2001 11:43 am to:=09taylor, mark subject:=09financial confirms ---------------------- forwarded by mark a taylor/efs/ees on 06/25/2001 12:= 45 pm --------------------------- from:=09peter keohane/enron@enronxgate@enronxgate on 06/25/2001 11:00 am cd= t sent by:=09sharon crawford/enron@enronxgate to:=09mark a taylor/efs/ees@ees cc:=09peggy hedstrom/enron@enronxgate, dianne seib/enron@enronxgate, laura = e scott/enron@enronxgate, morris richard clark/enron@enronxgate, greg johns= ton/enron@enronxgate, mark powell/enron@enronxgate, chris gaffney/tor/ect@e= ct, derek flaman/enron@enronxgate, linda sietzema/enron@enronxgate, sharon = crawford/enron@enronxgate=20 subject:=09financial confirms mark, i wanted to track down two procedural matters with you respecting fin= ancial confirms: 1.=09currently we generate approximately 40-50 confirmations each day betwe= en ecc and ena/rmt, which creates some significant administrative and filin= g burdens. I am generally aware, but not precisely clear on the details, t= hat there has been a recent decision that for certain counterparties, or at= least with respect to eol transactions, that confirms are no longer necess= ary. If in fact this is the case, can we do away with the formal confirmat= ion procedures between ecc and ena/rmt where there is not likely to be any = dispute. [morris/laura, if we do away with the formal confirms between ecc= and ena/rmt, and provided that we have a tagg or sitara deal ticket, is th= ere any ancillary tax purpose for generating confirms between ecc and ena/r= mt?] 2.=09in the same vein, for certain non-inter-company financial transactions= completed on eol, i understand that it has been approved not to send confi= rms. Again, mark can you please clarify this policy for me, including how = we determine for which counterparties this ought to apply in canada. It wa= s my (again general) understanding that it may have depended upon the wordi= ng of the master agreement with the counterparty and/or the volume of tran= sactions executed with the counterparty.
