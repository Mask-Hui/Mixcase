Skean.nsf steve- this is a good example of something you and mike should discuss (the merits of the trip aside for a moment considering we don't have any clean projects inany of these countries) can help define my role in the environmental area if any. In this spirit i'd love your and mike's thoughts. I did tell joe that mike was replacing me and had the lead in the environmental area. He passes his congratulations on! ---------------------- forwarded by terence h thorn/enron_development on 02/09/2000 11:49 pm --------------------------- joe hillings@enron 02/09/2000 04:18 pm to: terence h thorn/enron_development@enron_development cc: steven j kean/hou/ees@ees, john palmisano/enron_development@enron_development, chris long/corp/enron@enron, lora sullivan/corp/enron@enron subject: department of commerce missions on clean energy-request for enron's participation terry: allan bowser, das, doc for basic industries and helen burroughs visited with me this afternoon to tell me about the initiative based on the president's state of the union address. Allan will lead a group of 15 to 20 us businesses interested in clean energy to china, india, indonesia, mexico and brazil in phase one of the initiative and would like enron to be a participant. I have suggested that you were the appropriate senior person that should be invited to a white house meeting in the next two weeks regarding the program. He has been working with roger ballantine and jeff seabright who are his and helen's contacts. They are asking allan to head the mission. He feels that companies involved in this mission become recognized or further recognized as supporters of clean energy. He gave me several handouts which are being faxed to you and others copied on this memo. You or your staff should be on the lookout for allan or helen's invitation. Helen also asked about emissions trading and i told her about john palmisano. I believe she is interested in having john brief people at the doc on this type of opportunity. Joe
