Sellers \(e-mail\)" <william.sellers@wright.edu> cc: subject: hornswoggled & bamboozled i don't know whether or not you read the article i sent about contesting the election, but i went a step further and listened to and watched the video associated with that article. The first lawyer, earl carroll, who spoke against contesting the election during the james baker press conference, used the argument that many ballots from other counties in florida and other states contained no vote for president. He called them "non votes." therefore, we shouldn't think it unusual for that to happen in the counties where gore wants the recount. What kind of sophistry and deception is this? democrats and all fair-minded people are being hornswoggled and bamboozled by this kind of propaganda. It makes me think that goebles (i forget how he spelled his name) was really an amateur. I'm afraid we're not going to be able to combat this. Democrats are not devious enough to anticipate what bush's strategists may do next.
