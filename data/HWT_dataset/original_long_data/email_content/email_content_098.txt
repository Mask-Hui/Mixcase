Mtaylor.nsf martin: my assistant, jan dobernecker, tells me that sylvia sauseda has arranged for an office for you here on the 38th floor. The room number is eb3850. Sylvia is in the process of arranging for a telephone and computer for your office and will talk to hr about a badge. Hr should have the badge waiting for you at the desk in the lobby when you arrive. If it isn't and your hr person is not available, just call jan dobernecker at x33427 and she will tell them to let you in. Sylvia will also attempt to find parking for you. If you haven't heard from her by friday, i suggest you park in any of the uncovered lots near the building on monday morning. They are more reasonably priced than the garages (which sometimes charge $20 or more for a single day if you don't have a contract). We're looking forward to seeing you! have a good trip. Mark martin rosell 01/12/99 07:57 am to: mark - ect legal taylor/hou/ect@ect cc: subject: houston mark, all systems ready to go on friday morning. I thus expect to be in the office on monday morning (18 jan.). Could you please ask one of the assistants to help in organising and setting up a working station (computer and the rest of the requisite gear). Also, since it is a bit tricky to establish contact with houston h/r, this person could perhaps arrange a card/badge for me and a car parking ticket (or advise me where to put the car on monday morning). I'm looking forward to seeing you and the rest of the legal dept on 18 jan. Martin
