Kate symes 6-27-02.nsf i've left a message for stewart rosman, the mid-marketer who did this deal, to find out whether or not he wants this confirmed. Diana scholtes said she thought he did, in which case i need to determine with him what kind of deal this should be, and we'd need to confirm the first leg. I'll let you know as soon as i hear back from him. Thanks, kate from: sharen cason 04/26/2001 03:08 pm to: kate symes/pdx/ect@ect cc: subject: 565226 there is a leg 2 for this deal that has come up on the list to be confirmed. We did not confirm leg 1 of this deal and i don't think we confirm buy/resales as they are like transmission. Could check into this and let me know. Thanks!
