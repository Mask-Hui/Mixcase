Probably the most underrated racing game ever! its not just a racing game, its more than that! its pretty much a racing mmorpg. With plenty of things to do. You can obviously race, earn money, buy new cars and houses to store your collection of cars, and go to the casino if you have the dlc for it. I've played this on all the sytems its avalible for but the pc is my favorite because the graphics are more rich and detailed. I like the selection of cars in the game ranging from, the crappy beginners cars to the fast and luxurious super cars such as the bugatti veyron super sport! go ahead and buys this if you love cars and just driving around beautiful tropical islands with lots to do!
