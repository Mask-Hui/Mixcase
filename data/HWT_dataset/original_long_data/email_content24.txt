Attached find enron power marketing, inc., and enron energy services' responses to the staff's data requests in the federal energy regulatory commission's bulk power investigation. These responses assumes that you sent separate data requests to enron wind, so they do not include that information. The answers also assume you are requesting this information for california (and therefore the western interconnect) only. Please let me know if these assumptions are incorrect. If you were requesting eastern interconnect information you need to contact chrisit nicolay at the above e-mail address. Enron requests confidential treatment of response numbers 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 pursuant to 18 c.f.r. Section 388.112. Due to the short turn around time for these requests we were unable to respond to question 8 and to provide the unit identifier requested in question 4. We hope to be able to provide this information on monday. Please call me with any questions at (503) 464-8862. I will be traveling on monday, so if you call then, call my cell phone at 503 807-0929.
