I was a weedy child. This wasn't so much an accident of physiology, more an unnecessary attempt by the world to fully cast me in the role of maths geek. Of course, at that age i wasn't of a mind to worry; but eventually i decided that i was hideous. There is one particular family holiday where all the photos have me hiding in the shadows, for fear of nothing less than being seen. And then i grew up a little; and found out that whilst i would never be very well built, so to speak, i had quietly grown to a respectable height amongst my peers. I started putting more stock not in how i looked but how i carried myself; i started losing my clumsiness. And now whilst i'm still not much to look at, my body ususlly does what i ask of it, what i need it to. I got comfortable with myself, i accepted what i was never going to be. Although i could never be a nudist, and for two very good reasons: i) the cold, and ii) my need for pockets. And did i mention, the cold? i generally have lots of things in my pockets; i find it is one of the better things about men's clothes: there is no 'line' to ruin, as such. So i feel if naturism was to become compulsory, i'd need some sort of utility belt. And a nipple piercing to stop me losing my keys, obviously, but firstly a utility belt. Being naked is no excuse for not having a grappling hook handy... Man, i'm tired. N.
