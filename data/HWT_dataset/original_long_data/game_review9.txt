(review counted as the complete sam and max seasons 1,2 and 3 however seasons 1 and 2 currently do not work on windows 10) really entertaining and funny point and click adventure game. Though i admit i am a bit dumb when it came to puzzles in this game...often ended up looking up guides &gt;w&gt; shhhhh! in all honesty the puzzles (basicly everything you do in the game) are all well thought out so there isn't any super unrealistic answer to a problem that hasn't been hinted slightly in the game....like pixel searching or using items together in a way that makes no sense to solve a problem. Get it if you love point and click adventure games because this is as good as it gets!! ^.^ as long as you dont mind 15 games appearing in your games library after only buying 3.....
