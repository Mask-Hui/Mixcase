        urlLink Deep Links  -- Deep Links is a group weblog featuring pointers to news articles and weblog posts that spark the interest of  urlLink EFF [Electronic Frontier Foundation]  staff members. We aim to provide a bit of on-the-fly commentary to help contextualize issues, as well as links to useful background resources.  The topics we'll be exploring include intellectual property, privacy, free speech on the Net, technology and Internet architecture. The central questions driving these explorations: How does a particular development affect our rights? And how will it impact our future?
