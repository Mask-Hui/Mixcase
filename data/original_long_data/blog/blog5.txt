       I understand now...I guess I did all this time, From today until ever, you're just that one who walks by my side, wanting me or not. Although it has been  a year since then, I couldn't feel it until today. You look at me through the mirror, watch me bleeding upon the altar of my life and all you could do is stare at my eyes and walk through hell with me. All I want to know is if this is only but a dream...  Are we real?... The smell of the blood is too intense, I'm lying there...Wanting to dream again...I open my eyes and I see you standing right by my side, You say nothing, only watch me bleeding...But that's all you were doing, right?  You're just another illusion of my mind...Although I'll never let go
