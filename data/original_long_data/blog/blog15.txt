           WOW!  How about this...Maurice Clarett can  urlLink enter the NFL draft .  Will this be agood thing or a bad thing?  I've read several opinions on this and I think I have to agree, that this is a wrong decision.  The NFL has very clear guidelines and on when they will accept a player and they are not discriminating.   urlLink Whatever happened to good common sense ?  Here's  urlLink one guy  that thinks it won't make a difference to the NFL.  What do you think?
