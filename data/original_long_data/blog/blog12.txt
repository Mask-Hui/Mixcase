        Cissy Houston To Hold Harlem Prayer Vigil For Whitney   I swear to God, Fox's  Roger Friedman  is the blackest white man in the entertainment reporting business. Today he gives us the scoop on  Whitney Houston , with a little blue eyed soul. He writes:  ' Whitney Houston's  mother is taking a stand on her children's substance abuse problems.   ' Cissy Houston , the great R&B and gospel singer, is leading a prayer vigil next Monday night in Harlem. In a simple announcement on New York radio station KISS-FM Houston called the two-hour event 'mothers praying for healing.'   ''Let us pray for healing and deliverance,' Houston said in the recorded message, 'for our children affected by substance abuse.'   'The event will held from 7 to 9 p.m. at the  urlLink Abyssinian Baptist Church . Sources tell me that by Monday Houston and others involved in the planning should have quite a team of performers, celebrities and clergy who will participate. My guess is that Cissy's cousins  Dionne  and  Dee Dee Warwick , as well as many other notables, will attend.'  Shouldn't Dionne have predicted this?   I mean, isn't that what friends are for?  My guess is  Al Sharpton ,  Lennox Lewis ,  Mike Tyson ,  Janet Jackson , and various members of  New Edition  will be in attendance.   The Corsair  wishes Whitney good luck.
