I think this point is moot for the time being because (as of last Tuesday) we
are not dealing with Bidder D.

I think it is ok legally to go this way -- although there is potential
liability under the WARN Act (the plant closing law).  We probably can
schedule around that exposure, though, by giving everyone who possibly may be
affected 60 days' notice.

Practically, however, this would not be my favorite approach.  I'd prefer it
if we could have the ability to compete for top performers, but we should be
able to manage that by working through the persons who we identify and
present for possible hiring by the buyer.

I would like more information about what is meant by "ENA does not interfere
with" the offers made by the buyer.  Does that mean no counteroffers?

To answer the question of whether we can bind all of Enron, I would say that
it is unlikely, unless we want to ask.  It is easier to commit only the
wholesale group, rather than ask Corp., EES, Broadband, etc.  whether they
will abide by the agreement, so I would recommend limiting it to that group,
if possible.  We may be able to include the pipelines, given that they have
been involved in this transaction.

Let me know if you have any questions.
