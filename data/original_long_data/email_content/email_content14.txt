In response to Glen Hass' voicemail identifying his concerns regarding the 
remaining mainline capacity going west, I have included additional data on 
the revised file attached below.  Only the second worksheet entitled 'TW 
Primary Holder'  was modified.  I have added the remaining contract data 
where capacity is held in Arizona.  I have also provided sub-totals and 
totals where applicable for ease of verification.

Please feel free to contact me if you need additional information.  I will 
continue to check my voicemail/email periodically during my vacation.
