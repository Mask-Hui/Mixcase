I love the noir feel of this game as well as the jamacan music and the characters seem quite interesting and not too stereotypical in my opinion. I've seen some people in the reviews stating that both Grim Fandango and The Journey Down have a similar feel in gameplay, I disagree with that and I wasn't feeling any 'tim schafer moments' in this title, not that that's a flaw of course, This game has it's own unique feel and setting one can enjoy. I agree that it has a similar design to Grim Fandango so I can see why people would draw connections. It also has easier puzzles than many of the Tim Schafer titles so you might enjoy this game as somewhat of a beginner puzzle, to put it bluntly.  I think the developers should work on the lip syncing seeing how most of the dialogue is out of sync with the phonems of the characters. Also the quality of sound heard from some of the characters sounded quite rough (matoke at the front of mama makena's bar is a good example of this), although I didn't see many flaws in the voice acting itself. And you may find that this game is a bit short for your liking, though since I bought the game so cheaply on sale, I didn't mind.  I recommend this game to all those puzzle finatics looking for something unique and original and any new gamer to this genre.
