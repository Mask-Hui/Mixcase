This game is an example of very interesting concepts and very fascinating (and disturbing) art and story. Unfortunately, it suffers from a difficulty curve based only on how time consuming and frustrating certain levels are. Most of the challenges rely on either counter-intuitive presentation (e.g. requiring the player to fling goo balls into an area that claims to be dangerous but isn't) or making the player guess what the physics will decide to do next. The interface is mostly just dragging goo balls where you want them, but many of the levels require dragging specific goo balls quickly, which is often impossible to do because of the game not selecting the right one if there's any overlap. This issue is then made worse by only certain goo balls being removable after placing them (which the player has to figure out themselves) as well as by the only way of reversing a move being to click on the little bugs that pop up for no explained or intuitive reason twice. Not once, twice. If you only click on one reversal bug, the game almost always reverts back to the most inconvenient possible situation.  The two biggest things I took away from this game was a deep sense of boredom and the feeling that the makers don't understand how an object's center of gravity works. Even the constantly moving goo balls do not explain those bizarre weight mechanics work
