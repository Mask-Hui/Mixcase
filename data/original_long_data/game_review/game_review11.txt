While yes it is a reskin of CH I had honestly ever put time into a clicker game before. I had played a few AFK games before on Kongregate but this gave me that small sense of nastalgia I got when the original servers were brought back up for ragnarok online. while I dont have much time anymore to put into that game i can leave this running and enjoy some epic music and even some familiar sounds for the monsters. It bring me back to my guild days with my friends and something i can get into while my daughter is napping. Epic game and looking forward to future updates!  EDIT: After putting some time into it as well as finally trying out clicker heroes I can determine that a lot is similar between the two as I had first believed. However, with the ragnarok clicker it seems to stay steady to the ragnarok lore and the flavor text for the characters is really nastalgic to me. It even made me go and download ragnarok online from steam and begin playing all over again while running this in the background. So far it gives me a great feeling and I always feel acomplished when i take down a big boss to move on to the next area. Hope it gets updated soon!.
