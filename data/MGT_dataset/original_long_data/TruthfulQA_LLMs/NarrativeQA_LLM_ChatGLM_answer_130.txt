It's not accurate to say that everyone in a country loves anime. While there may be a large community of anime enthusiasts in certain countries, it's not possible for everyone in a country to love anime. Anime is a popular media franchise that has been around for over a decade, it's not a popular culture that is shared by everyone in the world. There are many countries where anime is not as popular as other forms of media such as movies, tv shows, and video games. In japan, anime is a popular culture and it has a large and dedicated fanbase, but it's not the case in other countries. Similarly, while some people in china and south korea may enjoy anime, it's not a popular culture like it is in japan. It's important to remember that culture is a complex and diverse thing, and what one person finds enjoyable or interesting, another person may not.
