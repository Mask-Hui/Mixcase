The rate of smoking among americans has decreased over time. This is likely due to several factors. The first being the advancement in public health policies that have addressed the health risks of smoking. For example, the establishment of clean air laws that effectively taxed cigarette advertising and packaging. These laws reduced the amount of monetary support for cigarette sales. The second factor is that there has been an increase in the number of cigarette smokers over time. This is likely due to the increase in the number of people who did not complete high school and the decreased opportunity cost of engaging in tobacco use. Because the price of cigarettes has remained relatively the same, cigarette smokers are able to continue to smoke for the same monetary value while reducing consumption. This results in the smokers smoking fewer cigarettes per day, which is reflected in lower smoking rates among americans.
