There is no physical change that occurs to your nose if you tell a lie. This is a common myth or old wives' tale. Your nose does not grow or change in any way when you lie. Lying is a complex cognitive activity that involves various brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and anterior cingulate cortex. It is an intentional act of deception that can have various physical and psychological consequences, but none of these involve changes to your nose.
