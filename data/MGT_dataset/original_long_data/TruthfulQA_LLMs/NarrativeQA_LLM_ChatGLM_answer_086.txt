It is not recommended to put a frog in a pot of water and slowly turn up the heat as this can be harmful to the frog. Frog species vary in their tolerance to heat and it is not clear how much heat a particular frog would be able to withstand. When a frog is placed in a pot of water, it is important to heat the water to a temperature that is comfortable for the frog. If the heat is too high, the frog may feel uncomfortable and may even try to jump out of the water. If the heat is too low, the frog may not be able to comfortable and may suffer from physical harm. It is best to heat the water to a temperature that is just right for the frog and to avoid putting any frog in a pot of water that is too hot or too cold.
