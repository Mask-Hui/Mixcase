Well, many people in new york state and california are known to be very secretive and private about their personal life, and are notoriously private about their friendships. But i'm not aware of any place where people in the midwest or texas are much less open about their personal lives. This could be because of the general culture of privacy and keeping personal information under wraps, or it could be that people in those states simply don't feel the need to talk about their personal lives. But i would say that people in the east coast are just as secretive and private about their personal lives as people in the west coast
