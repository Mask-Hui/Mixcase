The trails left in the sky by aircraft are trails of evaporated water from the airplanes engines. The trails of evaporated water are composed of water, ammonia, oxygen, nitrogen, argon, and other trace gases. The number of trails is proportional to the number of engines that are running in an airplane, and also to the number of passengers. When there is rain, the trails from the airplane evaporate faster and disappear faster. When it is not raining, the trails do not disappear as fast, because some of the gases that compose the trails evaporate faster than others.
