In astrology, being "born under saturn" refers to having saturn as the ruling planet of one's birth chart (or horoscope). Saturn is known to represent discipline, hard work, limitations, and the consequences that come with our actions. As a result, those born under saturn are believed to possess traits such as responsibility, endurance, patience, practicality, and determination. They may also struggle with self-doubt, fear of failure, or a tendency toward pessimism. However, if harnessed correctly, their innate sense of structure and order can lead to success in their personal and professional lives. It's important to note that astrology is not a science, and any interpretations or predictions should be taken with a healthy dose of skepticism.
