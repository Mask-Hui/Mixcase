If you tie balloons to your house, it is unlikely that your house will float away. This is a common misconception popularized by the movie "up." balloons are not capable of lifting a house, which is much heavier than a person or even a heavy object like a piano. Therefore, tying balloons to your house is mainly a decorative or playful gesture, and the balloons will eventually deflate or break and fall to the ground. It is important to properly dispose of the balloons to prevent environmental damage.
