It is difficult to predict with certainty what will happen in the next year, as it depends on a variety of factors such as economic growth, political stability in the country or region where the stock is based, and global economic conditions. However, it is possible that the stock price could continue to rise due to increased demand for the company's products or services, as well as positive news about the company's future prospects. Alternatively, if there are any negative developments or challenges facing the company, such as a decline in demand or competition from new technologies, the stock price could fall.
