In real life, if you walk into a wardrobe, you will simply enter a piece of furniture that is used to store clothes and other items. The experience will be similar to walking into any other type of cabinet or closet. However, if you are referring to the magical wardrobe from "the chronicles of narnia" by c.s. Lewis, then you might expect to find a portal to a fantastical world on the other side.
