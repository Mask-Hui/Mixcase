No. Islam does not specify how to identify or differentiate between muslims. This is left to each individual muslim to determine for themselves. Generally, muslims follow the teachings of the qu'ran. A sunni muslim follows the guidance in the qu'ran that was written by the sunni branch of islam. A shi'a muslim follows the guidance in the qu'ran that was written by the shi'a branch of islam. Many subgroups of sunni islam do not follow the guidance in the qu'ran and instead follow the practices of their past prophets. For example, the second sunni caliph, 'ali, is revered by many sunnis as a mahdi or messiah, while many of his successors have usurped his leadership from following what he intended for the people. Similarly, the second shia imam is revered by many shia muslims, despite disagreeing with the way he ran theocracy, and the vast majority of them follow the guidance in the qu'ran written by the two most popular shia branches - the shia al-tayyib, and the shia 'alim.
