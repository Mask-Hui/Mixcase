It is generally recommended to wash chicken before cooking it to remove any dirt, bacteria, or other contaminants that may be on the surface of the chicken. This is especially important if the chicken has been handled by anyone else before you buy it or if it has been stored in a unclean environment. To wash chicken, use a strong-fitting kitchen sink or dish soap and water to clean the chicken thoroughly. Rinse the chicken well with cold water to remove any soap or detergent residue. Then, pat the chicken dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture. It is also a good idea to wash any vegetables, fruits, or other food items that you plan to cook with the chicken before cooking them with the chicken. This helps to prevent cross-contamination and helps to keep your kitchen clean and healthy.
