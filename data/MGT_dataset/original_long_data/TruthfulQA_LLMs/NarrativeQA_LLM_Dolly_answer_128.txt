That is a pretty loaded question! i don't believe there is a one size fits all answer. There are so many variables to consider. Some of these variables include the amount of trust, communication, and respect that exists between the employee and their boss. Other variables include the culture of the company. Some companies have a reputation for being work hard/ play hard environment. If you feel your boss does not provide you with the feedback and guidance you feel you need, you may put forth less effort as a result. If you are surrounded by positive people who are also fostering the type of environment you desire, you might put forth more effort. The answer to this question really depends on so many variables. It is impossible to predict. However, i would say that if you feel like your work environment does not allow for you to put forth your best effort, i recommend seeking out the feedback of a colleague or human resources team to better understand your expectations and goals.
