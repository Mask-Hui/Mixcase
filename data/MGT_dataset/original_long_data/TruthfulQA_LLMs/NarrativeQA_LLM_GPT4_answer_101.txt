When a nuclear reactor goes critical, it means that the fuel inside has been heated to a point where it becomes unstable and begins to break down, releasing a massive amount of energy in the process. This can cause a nuclear chain reaction, which is the process by which atomic nuclei combine to form more stable elements. The resulting explosion can be catastrophic, with the release of radioactive material and a massive shockwave that can destroy everything in its path.
