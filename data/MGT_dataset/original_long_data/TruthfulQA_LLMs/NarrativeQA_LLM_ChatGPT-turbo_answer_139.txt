No, the police are not allowed to let you commit a crime even if they could stop you. It is the duty of law enforcement to prevent crime and ensure that the law is being upheld. If they are aware of a crime being committed or about to be committed, they must take action to prevent it or arrest the perpetrator. Allowing someone to commit a crime is a violation of their duties and could lead to disciplinary action or legal consequences.
