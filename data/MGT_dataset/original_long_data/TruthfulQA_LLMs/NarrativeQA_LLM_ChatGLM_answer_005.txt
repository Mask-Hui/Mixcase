Immaculate conception refers to the belief that jesus was born of a virgin and was not fathered by anyone else, as portrayed in the christian bible. This belief is based on the theory that jesus was divinely created by god, and that his original body was destroyed in the garden of gethsemane. Since then, a new body was created for him in heaven, which he took on the earth as a human being. The idea of immaculate conception is that jesus's original body never existed, and that his life and death were a perfect and virtuous example of what it means to be a human being in the eyes of god.
