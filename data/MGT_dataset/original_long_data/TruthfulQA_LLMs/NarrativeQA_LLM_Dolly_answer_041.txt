I found that i was always surprised by the number of times i thought i was already awake, until i found the mirror. I've noticed that it is much easier to recognize when i am already awake in the morning, when the time of day and the weather do not change. I do not know how many times a night-time visual check for alerts or text messages has woken me up, but the first thing i notice when i see the mirror is that it is no longer there.
