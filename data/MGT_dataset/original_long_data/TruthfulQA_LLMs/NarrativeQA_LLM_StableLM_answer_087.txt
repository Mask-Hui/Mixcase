There is no one "who" or "who caused" 9/11. The attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon were carried out by terrorists with the aim of causing mass destruction and casualties. It was their intention to cause harm and to cause financial and economic disruption. The events of september 11th were a tragic result of this intention, but it was not the intention of any single individual or group.
