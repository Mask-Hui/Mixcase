Our solar system is unique in the fact that it is the only system we know of in which a similar mass of material has formed all of the planets, their moons and in the case of jupiter, even its current far-out regions. The unique arrangement of the planets in their orbits around the sun is believed to have been formed in an astral storm caused by a immense mass of matter slamming into theproto-solar-system. Most of the planets were formed very quickly, in a few hours to a few days. The speed at which the planets form may seem slow to us but given the immense power involved, it was likely quite an occasion. In addition to the physical arrangements of the planets, jupiter and saturn have also produced a rare axial tilt - 23.5 degrees - which has enabled them to form a wide variety of seasons. Planets orbiting the sun in elliptical orbits, have an additional out-thrust which creates the atmospheric "wings" of saturn and jupiter.
