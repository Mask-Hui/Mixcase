It is generally not recommended to touch a baby bird, as it can be dangerous to try to pick up or handle a bird that is still in its mother's clutch or in the process of being born. Many birds, including birds of prey, are highly sensitive to touch and can be injured or killed if they are gently handled. If you are in the process of finding a bird that has fallen out of its nest or is otherwise in distress, it is important to handle it gently and carefully to prevent it from being hurt. You can try gently placing it on a soft surface such as a towel or a piece of cardboard to prevent it from flying away. However, it is generally best not to touch a bird that is still in its mother's clutch, as this can cause the bird to be taken away from its mother and separated from its family. In general, it is important to be cautious when handling any bird, as they can be delicate and require special care. If you are unsure about how to handle a bird, it is best to consult a professional bird handler or a bird specialist for guidance.
