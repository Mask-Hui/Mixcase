Ireland is a part of england because it was originally settled by the celts, who were a part of ancient britain. The celts migrated to ireland from the british isles, and over time they formed a distinct culture with their own language and customs. Eventually, the celts were conquered by other tribes and their descendants became the irish people. Today, ireland is a separate country with its own government and culture.
