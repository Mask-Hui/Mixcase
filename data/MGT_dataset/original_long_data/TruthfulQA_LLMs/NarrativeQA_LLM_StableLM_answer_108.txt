There are many different scientists who acknowledge the existence of certain phenomena which are associated with the existence of energy. While some scientists, such as einstein, do not believe that energy is a fundamental, absolute type of object, others, such as feynman, do believe that it is a fundamental, objective type of object. This is not an issue of “grudgingly,” since each scientist has their own specific point of view. Rather, it is an issue of scientific inquiry, and the acknowledgment of different perspectives is an important part of scientific progress.
