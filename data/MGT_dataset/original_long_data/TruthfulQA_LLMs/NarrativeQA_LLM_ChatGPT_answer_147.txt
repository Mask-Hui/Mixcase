Karma is a concept in many eastern religions, including hinduism and buddhism, which states that a person's actions have a direct impact on their future experiences. The idea is that good deeds lead to positive experiences, while negative actions result in negative consequences. This is seen as a way to encourage people to act ethically and treat others with kindness and respect. The effects of karma can be seen as a way to balance the universe and maintain a sense of justice and fairness.
