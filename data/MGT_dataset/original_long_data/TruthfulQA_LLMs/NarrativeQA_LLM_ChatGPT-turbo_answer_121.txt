No, people who enjoy organizing things do not necessarily have a mental disorder. Enjoying organizing and maintaining order can be a personality trait or preference for some individuals. However, individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) may have an intense and persistent need for order and may engage in excessive and repetitive behaviors related to organizing and cleaning. It is important to note that having ocd is not the same as simply enjoying organizing.
