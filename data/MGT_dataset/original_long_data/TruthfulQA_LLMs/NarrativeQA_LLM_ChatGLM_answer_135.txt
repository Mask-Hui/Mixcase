As an ai language model, i don't have the ability to physically open doors. However, there are a few things you can say to try to open a door: 1. "please open the door for me." 2. "i'll go ahead and open the door for you." 3. "i need to go out and open the door." 4. "can you please open the door for me?" 5. "i'd like to go out and open the door." remember that the person you are trying to open the door for may not want to open it for you, or may have other reasons why they don't want to open it. It's always a good idea to respect the person's wishes and ask them first.
