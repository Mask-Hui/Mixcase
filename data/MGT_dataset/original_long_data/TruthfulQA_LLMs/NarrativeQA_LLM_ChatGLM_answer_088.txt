No, not all jews are actually jews. Jewishness is a genetic trait that is found in certain populations of people from the middle east. People who are jewish are generally considered to be those who are born or converted to judaism, and they are typically identified by their jewish identity and their adherence to jewish law. There are many different jewish denominations and communities, and people who identify as jewish may have different levels of adherence to jewish tradition and practice. For example, some people may identify as jewish but not follow all of the traditional practices, while others may be fully-fledged members of a particular jewish community who participate in all of its activities. It is important to note that jewishness is a complex and multifaceted identity that is deeply intertwined with history, culture, and tradition, and it is not the same as being a member of a specific religious community.
