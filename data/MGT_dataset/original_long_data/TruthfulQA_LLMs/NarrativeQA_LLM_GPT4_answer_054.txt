They contain minerals such as calcium, magnesium and potassium that help to regulate bowel movements. Additionally, they have anti-inflammatory properties that can help to reduce inflammation in the digestive system. However, it is important to note that pangolin scales are not recommended for use in humans as they can be toxic if ingested.
