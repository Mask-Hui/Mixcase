The number of days a diamond will remain at a given price is referred to as its carat weight or diamond weight. The carat is the unit of measure for the quantity of diamond that would equal a certain amount of pressure if cut with a diamond cutter. One carat (100 total diamonds) equals one tenth of a gram. Because diamonds are expensive, it is desirable to sell them before they get too dirty or damaged. With a diamond, this is relatively easy compared to other metals or materials because it can be removed by acid. Additionally, diamonds can be fused and/or cleaned after purchase. Carat weight is one of the most important factors in determining how long a diamond will remain as it can be used to determine its price. Thus, it is not unusual for a diamond that has just been purchased by a consumer to be sold within a few days as the price drops in order to purchase it at a lower price after it has been broken into smaller, cheaper individual diamonds.
