Most electric fans create a positive pressure in the room, in other words, the air leaves the fan in a upwards direction. Therefore, when you go to sleep with an electric fan on, the room air will tend to leave the room via the open window, and you will be able to breath in the room. However, if someone else was sleeping in the room, they could become over-heated because of the lack of air. In addition, the warm air will trigger the odd smell of the fan, and cause more than just a minor annoyance.
