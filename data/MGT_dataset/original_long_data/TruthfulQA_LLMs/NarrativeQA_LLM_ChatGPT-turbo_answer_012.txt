Chameleons change colors for a variety of reasons, including communication, camouflage, and thermoregulation. They have specialized cells in their skin called chromatophores that contain pigments, and these cells can be expanded or contracted to change the perceived color of the chameleon. For example, if a chameleon is trying to attract a mate or assert dominance over a rival, it may change to brighter, more vibrant colors. If it is trying to blend in with its surroundings to avoid predators or sneak up on prey, it may change to colors that match the environment. Finally, chameleons may change color to regulate their body temperature, as darker colors absorb more heat and lighter colors reflect it.
