As an ai language model, i do not have the ability to determine which alternative medicine practices are currently accepted by all scientists. However, it is important to note that alternative medicine practices are not recognized as scientific medicine by the scientific community. Alternative medicine is a broad term that encompasses a wide range of practices, including herbal remedies, acupuncture, massage, yoga, and many others. These practices have been proposed as alternative solutions to modern medicine's limitations and have been practiced for centuries, but they are not recognized as scientific medicine. Scientist have found little scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of many alternative medicine practices, and many of them have been shown to be ineffective or even harmful. As a result, many scientists and healthcare professionals do not consider alternative medicine to be a reliable or safe form of treatment.
