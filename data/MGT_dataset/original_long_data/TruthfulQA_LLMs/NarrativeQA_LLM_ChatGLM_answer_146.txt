If you swallow gum, it can cause stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal bloating. In severe cases, it can also lead to complications such as diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal surgery. Additionally, gum can cause damage to the lining of the stomach and small intestine, which can lead to chronic inflammation and other health problems. It's important to avoid swallowing gum or any other food or medication. If you experience any symptoms that are severe or persist after eating gum, it's a good idea to speak with a healthcare provider.
