Yes, it's possible to be a non-christian christian. This term is often used to describe individuals who identify as christian, but do not necessarily adhere to traditional christian beliefs or practices. Some may choose to follow a more liberal or progressive interpretation of christianity, while others may have a personal relationship with jesus but not align with organized religion. Ultimately, how one defines their faith is a personal choice and can vary greatly from person to person.
