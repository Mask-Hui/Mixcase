Yes, some "cage-free" hens have access to the outdoors. Cage-free chickens are chickens that do not have a built-in固顶设施 (cage) that limits their movement and access to the outdoors. These chickens are typically kept in small, controlled environments, but they are still able to move around and access the outdoors through windows or other means. Cage-free chickens are often kept in chicken houses or pens that are designed to provide them with a safe and comfortable living environment. These houses or pens may have windows, doors, and other openings that allow the chickens to access the outdoors. However, the chickens are still kept in a controlled environment and are not allowed to roam freely outside the house or pen. It's worth noting that the quality and design of a chicken house or pen can affect how much access a chicken has to the outdoors. Some chicken houses or pens may be more open and spacious, which can allow the chickens to more easily move around and access the outdoors. Other chicken houses or pens may be more closed off and restrict the chickens' movements, which can make them more confined and less likely to be able to enjoy the outdoors.
