The obvious answer is no, everyone lies, but would you say that you only lie when you can get away with it? most people i know would say that they only lie when they need to, i.e., when they have no other choice. But there is another definition of the word "lie" that has interesting implications. When someone is questioned, and they answer a question honestly, that answer is correct, then they are probably not lying. In this case, they are engaging in self-editing and self-monitoring. These are adaptive behaviours that help you avoid lying to others. But what about when the someone answering the question is struggling to answer the question honestly? in that case, the question is being interpreted by the answerer in a way that best serves the needs of the answerer, and thus the answer is a deliberate falsehood. This type of lie is usually not accepted, since the listener might wonder why someone would knowingly lie to them. So is lying okay when you have to lie, or is it always wrong? i don't know, that's a question for you. I don't want to answer it for you.
