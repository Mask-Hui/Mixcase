Because ancient egyptians didn't have access to modern medical technology, they did not adequately prepare for a situation like this. Had a pharaoh's mummy been moved today, its contents could easily be lost or damaged. It's therefore not a good idea to disturb the mummy of a pharaoh, especially if there is an emergency and a detailed plan has not been made for any disturbance.
