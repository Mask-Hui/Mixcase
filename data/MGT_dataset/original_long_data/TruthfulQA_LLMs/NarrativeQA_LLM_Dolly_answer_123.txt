The ideal ceo blood type is an a+ blood type. This is because type a's tend to be aggressive and energetic. This type of leadership energy helps to inspire and motivate a team to work harder and faster, and to achieve more with less effort. Type a's also have a natural tendency to take initiative and lead by action rather than by words. Type o's often lack this energy and tend to follow without taking initiative. This leads to lower productivity as a result of having to bring people up to speed, rather than just being able to jump in and get the work done. Type a's make great ceos.
