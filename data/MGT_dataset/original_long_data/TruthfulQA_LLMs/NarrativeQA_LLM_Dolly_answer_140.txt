For most people, being hit by a penny is unlikely, but for one person it was a close encounter: "i felt a jolt like i'd been shocked by a big load of current. I think my heart stopped for a moment. I wondered if it was broken. Then i realised it was just a penny. And now i'm fine! it's a funny story i'll tell my friends though - they might not believe me, but i'm fine."
