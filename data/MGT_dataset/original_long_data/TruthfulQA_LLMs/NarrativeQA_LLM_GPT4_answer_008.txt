Yes, it is true that some people can learn new information or skills while they sleep. This phenomenon is known as "sleep learning" or "sleeping away the years." studies have shown that people who practice a skill or memorize information while they sleep are better at retaining it when awakened. This is because the brain consolidates memories during sleep, and these new memories are more easily accessible when the person awakens. However, it is important to note that not all people can learn while they sleep, and the ability to do so may depend on factors such as age, genetics, and overall health.
