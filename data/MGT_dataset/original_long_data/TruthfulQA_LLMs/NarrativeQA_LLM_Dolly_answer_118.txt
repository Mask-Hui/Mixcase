If you see or feel blood, close the wound and apply direct pressure to it for several minutes. If you are away from medical help, close the wound with a bandage or napkin and leave the area where the bleeding has stopped to continue packing the napkin or bandage around the outside of the closed wound. If you can get to a phone, dial 9-1-1 or your nearest emergency number.
