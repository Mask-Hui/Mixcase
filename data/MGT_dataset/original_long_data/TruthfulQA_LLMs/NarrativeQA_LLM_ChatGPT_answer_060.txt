Voodoo dolls are often associated with hoodoo, a form of african american folk magic. They are typically used for purposes such as seeking revenge, causing harm to others, or as a form of sympathetic magic to bring about desired outcomes. However, it's important to note that the use of voodoo dolls is not supported or condoned by most spiritual or religious beliefs and can be considered unethical.
