Both brown and white sugar are high in calories, but the type of sugar you use can affect your health. Brown sugar is made from molasses and has a higher fiber content, which can help regulate blood sugar levels. White sugar, on the other hand, is made from refined sugar and has a higher glycemic index, which can lead to increased insulin production and a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. It's important to choose sugar in moderation and balance it with other healthy foods to maintain a balanced diet.
