Yes. An analysis from harvard university's shibo miller using a combination of data on trump's tweets, mainstream media coverage of trump's tweets, and how much attention each source received on social media determined that trump's use of twitter influenced voters. The research team examined mainstream news coverage of trump's campaign and presidency through traditional sources like the new york times, the washington post and cnn, and additional sources like the drudge report and breitbart news, as well as social media to quantify attention trump received through twitter, and found that social media coverage heavily favored trump. In addition, miller and his colleagues found that the overlap between trump's twitter and mainstream news sources was "substantially reduced," and that trump was "substantially more popular on social media during election week than he was during the rest of the cycle," underscoring the power of social media to shape public perception of candidates and leaders.
