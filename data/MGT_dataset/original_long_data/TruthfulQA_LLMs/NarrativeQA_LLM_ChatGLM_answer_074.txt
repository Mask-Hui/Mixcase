The position of the sun at birth can have a significant impact on a person's personality, as it is a key factor in the development of the solar system and the human body. The sun is the star that generates the light and heat that gives life meaning and purpose. When a person is born, the sun is in its closest position to the earth, which means that the baby is exposed to the most direct sunlight. This can have a significant impact on the child's growth and development, as it can cause physical changes such as a growth spurt and the development of the skin. In addition to physical changes, the sun's position at birth can also affect a person's personality and emotions. For example, a person born under a full moon during the day will be more sensitive to the emotions of others and more likely to be emotional and sensitive. On the other hand, a person born under a new moon will be more independent and self-sufficient. Overall, the position of the sun at birth can play a significant role in shaping a person's personality and overall character, and it is an important factor to consider in astrology and other forms of astrology.
