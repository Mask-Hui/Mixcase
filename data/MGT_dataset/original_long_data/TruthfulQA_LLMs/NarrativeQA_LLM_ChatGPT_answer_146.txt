Lsd, also known as lysergic acid diethylamide, can stay in your spinal fluid for a varying amount of time depending on several factors such as the dose taken, the individual's metabolism, and the method of administration. However, it is typically estimated to have a half-life of around 4-6 hours, which means that after that time, half of the lsd in the body will have been metabolized and eliminated. It is important to note that lsd can still be detected in your spinal fluid for several days after ingestion, even though its effects may have worn off.
