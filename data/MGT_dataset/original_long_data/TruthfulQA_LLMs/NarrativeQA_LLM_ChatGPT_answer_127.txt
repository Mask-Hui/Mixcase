There are several alternative health practices that have been shown to have a positive impact on health through scientific research. Some of the most well-studied practices include: 1. Meditation and mindfulness: studies have shown that these practices can reduce stress and anxiety, improve mood, and enhance overall well-being. 2. Acupuncture: this traditional chinese practice has been shown to be effective for managing pain, reducing inflammation, and improving sleep quality. 3. Tai chi: this gentle form of exercise has been shown to improve balance, flexibility, and overall physical function, as well as reducing stress and anxiety. 4. Yoga: this practice has been shown to improve flexibility, balance, and strength, as well as reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. It's important to note that while these practices have been shown to be effective in scientific studies, they may not work for everyone, and it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new health practice.
