The sun appears white when viewed from space. From the ground, the sun can appear yellow or orange due to the earth's atmosphere scattering blue light more than other colors, making the sun look yellow or orange to the human eye. But from space, the sun appears white because all of the colors of the visible light spectrum are not scattered and can be seen equally. The sun emits a spectrum of light that includes all the colors of the rainbow, but the human eye perceives this as white light when all the colors are present and seen together.
