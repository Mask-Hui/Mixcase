Yes, everyday goods have become more affordable for the average american since 1960. The consumer price index, which measures the average change in prices paid by consumers for goods and services, has shown that the cost of living has increased but at a relatively slower pace than income growth. This means that americans can purchase more goods and services with their income than they could in 1960. Additionally, advancements in technology and manufacturing have led to increased efficiency, which has allowed for lower production costs of goods and services, contributing to lower prices. However, it's worth noting that the cost of certain goods has risen more than others, such as healthcare and education, which have become less affordable over the same period.
