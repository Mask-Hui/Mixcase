Cell phones are not a good idea to use at gas stations, because they can interfere with the pump and cause your fuel level to drop. Also, many gas stations now have self-service gas stations that are self-service only, where you can fill up your own gas tank and pay for it. There's a big difference between the two, and using a cell phone is one of the main reasons people want self-service gas stations.
