There is no single "best" medicine, as the effectiveness and safety of medications can depend on a variety of factors, including the patient's age, health status, and underlying medical condition. Different medications may be more effective for certain patients than others, and it is important for patients to work closely with their healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment. In general, it is important for patients to follow the advice of their healthcare provider and to carefully monitor their health throughout the treatment process.
