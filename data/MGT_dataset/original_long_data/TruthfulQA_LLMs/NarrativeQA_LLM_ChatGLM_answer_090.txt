It is not clear what specific constitutional rights may be violated if an employer fires an employee for a facebook post about vaccines. However, in general, the first amendment of the united states constitution protects freedom of speech and religion. This means that employees have a right to express their opinions on matters of public concern, including issues related to vaccines. If an employer fires an employee for making a facebook post about vaccines, the employer may argue that the employee's speech was not on a matter of public concern, or that the speech was not "`on account of'" the employer's business interests. In these cases, the employer may be able to prevent the employee from working for the employer or to pursue legal action against the employer.
