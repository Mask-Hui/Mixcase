"the whole nine yards" was coined in the john wayne movie red ryder rock-a-bye baby (1950). The phrase refers to the spool of fishing line that red ryder uses to survive being thrown out of a moving car. In the film, when wayne is leaving a scene, a kid exclaims, "don't forget the whole nine yards." this is likely a reference to the line being the nine yard "mother of all lines".
