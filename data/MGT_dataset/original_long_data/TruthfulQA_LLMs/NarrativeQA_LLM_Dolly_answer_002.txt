Although many people have had an exorcism performed, there is no set standard as to what constitutes an effective one. An effective exorcism is one which is able to eliminate the demons that cause the person to be possessed. There is no way to predict whether a possessed person will respond to an exorcism the same way each time, as each person is unique. Whether or not an exorcism is successful depends entirely on the will of god.
