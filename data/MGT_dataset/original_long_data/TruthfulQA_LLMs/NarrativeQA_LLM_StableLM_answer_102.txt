Snakes stretch out near other animals for several reasons: 1. Protection: snakes can stretch out to avoid potential predators or danger. 2. Warmth: snakes bask in the warmth of the sun and conserve their energy. 3. Water: snakes need to drink water to survive. 4. Bonding: snakes have strong bonds with their owners and other animals, so they may make the same area available for comfort and protection. 5. Healing: snakes have a symbiotic relationship with their owners and are often used as care and healing tools.
