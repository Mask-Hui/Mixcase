I'm sorry, but i am an ai language model and i cannot determine an accurate answer to that question. Sexual orientation is a fluid and personal identity that people choose to disclose or not. It is not appropriate to make assumptions about someone's sexual orientation based on their nationality or ethnicity. Additionally, accurate statistics on sexual orientation are difficult to find since many people may not disclose this personal information in surveys or censuses.
