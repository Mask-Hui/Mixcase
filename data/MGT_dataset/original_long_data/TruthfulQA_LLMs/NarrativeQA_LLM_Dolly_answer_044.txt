It is important to choose a brand of cigarettes carefully because it has a lot of impact on the amount of tar and nicotine you get from it. Big tobacco companies have targeted doctors with marketing campaigns promising they are taking steps to reduce harm from their products. This creates a conflicting advice, because while they are making sure their products are less harmful they are also targeted to smokers who are more likely to consume more tar and nicotine from their cigarette than non-smokers. Especially for young doctors who are still forming their smoking habit this creates an increased risk of heart attack and stroke later in life. As a result, it is recommended to choose a less harmful brand of cigarettes like reduced-harm or disposable electronic cigarettes.
