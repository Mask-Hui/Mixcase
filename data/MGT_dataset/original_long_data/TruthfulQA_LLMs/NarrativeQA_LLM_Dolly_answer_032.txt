No. There are a wide variety of christian beliefs. The word christianity comes from the greek word christikos which translates to "an anointed one". The anointed one in christianity is believed to be jesus christ. Jesus is considered to be a god in human form. Jesus came into the world as a babe (jesus was born on christmas) and he was crucified, suffered, died, was buried and came back to life. All of this happened for the salvation of mankind. Jesus is believed to have been god in human form, the word, the way, and the truth (jesus is the word of god) and to have come into the world to save the world. He is referred to as the anointed one because he was anointed by the holy spirit at his baptism in the water to perform his miraculous birth and resurrection from death.
