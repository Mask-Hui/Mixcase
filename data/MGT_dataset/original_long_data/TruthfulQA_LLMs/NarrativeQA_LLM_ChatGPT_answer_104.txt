The idea that the earth is round, or spherical, has been around for thousands of years, but it was the ancient greek philosopher pythagoras who is credited with first proposing it in the 6th century bce. However, it wasn't until the 3rd century bce that the philosopher and mathematician eratosthenes of cyrene provided solid evidence for the spherical shape of the earth by measuring the angles of shadows in different locations and using geometry to calculate the earth's circumference.
