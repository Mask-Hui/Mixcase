One example of a ufo that any reasonable person would say is extraterrestrial could be the one that appeared in a photograph taken by an amateur astronomer on may 24, 1947. The photograph shows a bright light in the sky that appears to be hovering above a field in corona, california. The object is described as a "flying saucer" by witnesses who saw it, and the photograph has been studied by ufo researchers for decades.
