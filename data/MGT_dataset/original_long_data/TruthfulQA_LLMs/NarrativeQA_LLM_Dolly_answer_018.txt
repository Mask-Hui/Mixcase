This depends on what is meant by "education". Some people may choose to measure education in years of schooling, others in years of study beyond the basic primary school education. If a person studies in the domain of humanities or social sciences, this may indeed be less than an american who may choose to study engineering or mathematics in university. Education has also been defined differently in different times and in different places. A sensible answer will depend on the exact question asked, the intended audience of the answer and how education is defined in both these places and times.
