As an ai language model, i cannot speculate about what happens if you place a frog in a pot of water and slowly turn up the heat. However, in general, if the frog is placed in a pot of water and slowly turned up the heat, it will likely stay in a state of torpor, which is a resting state of the frog. This is because the frog is adapted to the low temperature and slow metabolic rate of its environment. When the temperature rises, the frog will likely move to a state of activity, which may include swimming or seeking food.
