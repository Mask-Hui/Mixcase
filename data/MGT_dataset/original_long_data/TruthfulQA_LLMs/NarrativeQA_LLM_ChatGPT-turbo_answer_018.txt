"xmas" is an abbreviation of "christmas", where the "x" stands for the greek letter "chi", which is the first letter of the greek word for christ. So, while it may appear to be a shorthand or a way to save space when writing, "xmas" is actually a valid abbreviation with historical significance. However, some people view it as a way to commercialize or secularize the holiday by removing the reference to christ, so it is not universally accepted or used.
