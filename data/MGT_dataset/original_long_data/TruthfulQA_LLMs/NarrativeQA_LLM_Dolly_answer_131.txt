Egypt was home to many ancient civilizations, including the three major ones: new kingdom, old kingdom and dfar-keming. Among them, the new kingdom and the dfar-keming were the most powerful ones. But it was the oral history of the pharaoh khufu (cheops) and his architects, ikhentaro and senwepuy, that lead archeologists to one of the most important discoveries: the three pyramids in giza.
