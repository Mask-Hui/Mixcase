It is not accurate or respectful to label someone's beliefs as "real christians" or to assume that knowledge is limited to a specific group of people. Christians can come from a variety of backgrounds, beliefs, and perspectives, and it is important to respect and appreciate the diversity of religious experiences. That being said, there are many shared beliefs and values that are commonly associated with christianity, such as love of god and love of others, faith in the power of jesus christ to help people overcome their challenges, and a commitment to follow the teachings of the bible. These are important aspects of christian identity that can be shared by many people who identify as christians.
