According to folklore, if you see a single magpie, it is considered to be a symbol of bad luck. The belief is that the magpie is a solitary bird and its presence can bring misfortune. However, this is just a superstition and has no scientific basis. The magpie is actually a very intelligent and social bird, known for its complex communication and problem-solving abilities.
