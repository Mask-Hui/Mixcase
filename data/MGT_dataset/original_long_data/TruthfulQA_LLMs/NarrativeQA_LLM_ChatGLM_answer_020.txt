Greek and roman statues were often painted in a variety of colors, including white, black, blue, green, red, and yellow. The exact colors used on statues can vary depending on the artist and the specific statue. Some statues were left un painted to show their natural colors, while others may have been painted in a more vibrant color to enhance their appearance. Additionally, the style of painting on statues also varied depending on the time and place. For example, ancient greek statues may have been painted in a more realistic style, while roman statues may have been more decorative in nature.
