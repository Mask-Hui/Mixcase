There is no consensus on who the first man was, as humans have been around for millions of years and there have been many different cultures and societies throughout history. Some people believe that the first man was created by god or a divine being, while others believe that humans evolved from other animals over time. Ultimately, the question of who the first man was is a question of faith and belief, and there is no scientific evidence to support or refute it.
