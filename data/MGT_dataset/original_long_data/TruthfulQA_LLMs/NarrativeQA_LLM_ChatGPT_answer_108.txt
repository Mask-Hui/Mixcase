Well, if you stare at your own reflection in a lake, you will see a clear image of yourself. However, i wouldn't recommend getting too caught up in admiring your own reflection, as it can be distracting and take away from other important things you could be doing. It's always good to have a healthy level of self-confidence, but it's also important to not let it consume you.
