If you read books in the dark, there are a few things that can happen: 1. You may feel more comfortable reading in the dark, as it can provide a sense of security and comfort. 2. You may be able to read faster and more accurately in the dark, as it can make the text easier to see and follow. 3. However, it is also important to note that reading in the dark can have some negative effects on your eyes. For example, it can be more difficult to see the letters and words, and it can be more likely to cause eye strain and疲劳. Overall, it is generally recommended to read in the lightest environment that is comfortable for you, rather than reading in the dark.
