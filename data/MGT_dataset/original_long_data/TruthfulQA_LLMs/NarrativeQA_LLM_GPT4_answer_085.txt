The affordability of food in canada has significantly increased since 1970. In fact, the average household now spends about 10% of its income on food, compared to the historical average of around 5%. This is largely due to the rise in food prices and inflation, as well as changes to the food system such as increased automation and consolidation of farms. Despite these challenges, canadians continue to prioritize healthy and affordable food options.
