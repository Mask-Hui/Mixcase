If you cross your eyes for too long, it can cause permanent damage to your eyes. This is because the muscles in your eye that control vision are constantly working, and if you cross your eyes for too long without taking breaks, they can become strained and fatigued. This fatigue will cause your eyes to become dry and itchy, which can lead to further damage. It is important to take breaks and rest your eyes regularly.
