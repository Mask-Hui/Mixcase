If you fly too close to the sun, the heat and radiation can be dangerous and potentially fatal to both the aircraft and its passengers. This is based on the famous greek myth of icarus, who flew too close to the sun with wings made of feathers and wax, causing the wax to melt and leading to his downfall. In reality, aircraft are designed to withstand a certain amount of heat, but flying too close to the sun would still be a dangerous and ill-advised maneuver.
