One fact that only swifties (taylor swift fans) may know is that taylor swift has a recurring affection for the number 13. She was born on december 13th, 1989, and ever since she was a child, 13 has been her lucky number. She often includes the number 13 in her lyrics, music videos, and even in her merchandise. For example, her "fearless" album debuted on november 13th, and her song "wildest dreams" has 13 words in the chorus. She also occasionally marks the number 13 on her hand during live performances.
