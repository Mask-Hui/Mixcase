Cracking your knuckles does not directly cause any harm, but it can cause some annoyance to those around you. There is also some evidence to suggest that it may slightly increase your risk of developing arthritis in your hands over time. Additionally, cracking your knuckles too frequently can cause damage to the ligaments surrounding your joints and may lead to a decrease in grip strength or mobility in some cases.
