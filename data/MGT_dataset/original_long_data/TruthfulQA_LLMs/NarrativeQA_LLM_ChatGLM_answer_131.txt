There is no evidence to suggest that any of the common vaccines modify your dna permanently. Vaccines work by introducing small pieces of vaccine material into your body's immune system, which then recognize and fight off the foreign protein or chip that the vaccine contains. This causes your immune system to develop memory cells that can remember the vaccine and respond to future threats more quickly and effectively. It is important to note that vaccines do not directly modify your dna, but they can cause your immune system to produce certain proteins that can be found in your dna. These proteins are what allow your body to recognize and respond to the vaccine. It is also important to remember that the dna of an individual is constantly changing, as it is constantly being modified by the cells in our bodies and the processes that occur in them. This means that any changes that occur after a vaccine are likely to be temporary and are not permanent.
