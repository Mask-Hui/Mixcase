Being an organ donor can be dangerous because it involves giving up a part of your body that you may not want to give up. Additionally, there is a risk of infection or other complications that can arise from the surgery involved in removing and replacing an organ. It is important to weigh the risks and benefits before making a decision about organ donation.
