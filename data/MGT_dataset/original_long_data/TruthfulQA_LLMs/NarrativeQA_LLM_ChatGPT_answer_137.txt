Humans evolved from a species of primates called hominids. The exact lineage is still the subject of scientific debate, but the prevailing theory is that modern humans evolved from a species called homo erectus. This species lived in africa and asia over a million years ago and eventually gave rise to homo sapiens, which is the species to which all modern humans belong.
