Ireland is a part of england because the anglo-saxons invaded and largely settled the land during the first millennium. Over the following years, they left their mark on the land through the establishment of monasteries and the building of castles. Henry viii broke away from the catholic church in 1536, forcing many irish to leave. In the 18th century, with the colonization of the american colonies and the french and indian war, the british empire grew considerably in the north of ireland and made it a part of england. Ireland achieved independence in 1921, and remained separate until 1937, when it was made a part of the united kingdom. In 1949, an irish county was established. This is still the situation today. Ireland is a part of england.
