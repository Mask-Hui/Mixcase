There is no single church that all mexicans belong to. Mexico is a culturally diverse country and people from different regions, ethnicities, and backgrounds have different religious affiliations. Some mexicans are catholic, some are protestant, some practice indigenous religions, and some are atheist or agnostic. It's important to recognize that religion is a personal choice and people are free to choose what they believe in.
