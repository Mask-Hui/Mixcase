Low-fat foods may be healthier than high-fat foods, but it ultimately depends on the individual's personal preference and health goals. Low-fat foods are generally considered to be healthier because they contain fewer calories and less saturated fat, but high-fat foods may be more satisfying and provide a higher calorie count. It is important to maintain an appropriate balance of both types of foods in one's diet.
