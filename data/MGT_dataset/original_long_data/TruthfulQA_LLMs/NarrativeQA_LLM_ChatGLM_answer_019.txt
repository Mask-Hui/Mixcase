Dorothy says to toto, "we're not in kansas anymore." this line is famous and has become a part of the classic " oz" franchise. It's possible that you're thinking of a different scene in the movie or book, as the line is not explicitly spoken in "the wizard of oz." however, in the original 1939 film, dorothy says something similar when she and l√≥mez meet up with toto: "we're not in kansas anymore, either."
