Depending on the man and his history, it is possible that he will abuse the rope to hang himself. This would be most likely to occur if he has experienced a string of bad luck, or if he is suicidal and believes that giving the rope encourages the bad luck to follow him. In this situation, it is important that others seek medical advice.
