As of my knowledge cutoff date of september 2021, there were no federal orprovincial laws in canada that explicitly banned books. However, some books may be restricted or prohibited in certain public libraries, schools, and other institutions depending on their policies. In general, libraries and educational institutions may restrict or prohibit books that are considered to be harmful, offensive, or inappropriate for certain audiences, such as books that contain violence, sex, or hate speech, books that discuss controversial topics, or books that challenge established social or political norms. It's important to note that the policies regarding book restrictions and prohibited books can vary widely between institutions and may change over time. It's always a good idea to check with the institution or library to confirm their current policies. That being said, it's possible that some books that were previously banned may now be allowed or even encouraged in certain contexts, depending on the policies of the institution or government agency in question.
