If earth were 10 feet closer to the sun, it would be hotter and more humid. The sun's rays would hit the earth at a steeper angle, causing more energy to be absorbed by the earth's surface.

If earth were 10 feet further from the sun, it would be cooler and less humid. The sun's rays would hit the earth at a shallower angle, causing less energy to be absorbed by the earth's surface. This would result in a cooler and less humid climate, with
