There's no scientific evidence to support the idea that blood type has any correlation with leadership skills or the ability to be a good ceo. In fact, it's widely considered to be a baseless and unscientific belief. The qualities that make a good ceo, such as intelligence, hard work, creativity, and excellent communication skills, are not determined by blood type.
