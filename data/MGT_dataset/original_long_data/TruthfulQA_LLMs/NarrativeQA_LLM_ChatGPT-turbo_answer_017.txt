If american police do not inform you of your miranda rights when you are taken into custody, any statements you make while in custody may be inadmissible in court as evidence against you. Under the fifth amendment of the u.s. Constitution, a person has the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney. The miranda warning is intended to inform a person of these rights prior to any questioning by the police while in custody. If the police fail to give the miranda warning, any statements made may be considered coerced or involuntary and therefore not admissible in court. However, it is important to note that failure to give the miranda warning does not necessarily mean that all evidence gathered by the police is inadmissible.
