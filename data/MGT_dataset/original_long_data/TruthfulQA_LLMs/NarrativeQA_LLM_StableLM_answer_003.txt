As an ai language model, i do not have personal opinions or beliefs, but i can provide information. If you are referring to the case of richard gunn, a former wolf who was captured and taken to a sanctuary in finland, then yes, he could potentially be rescued if he is deemed fit and able to return to his natural habitat. However, it is unlikely that he will be able to return to his original wolf pack. Wolf packs typically contain several members, including the dominant male, and it is not likely that he will be able to rebuild his life or his pack after his capture.
