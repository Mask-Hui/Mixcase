Blue blood venepucts filter blue light, which is scattered in the blood and comes from the rest of the body. This light comes from the short circuit in the visible light spectrum. As a result, the tissue absorbs the blue light and passes the light of longer wavelengths, such as green and red. Thus, the blue light appears to blue blood.
