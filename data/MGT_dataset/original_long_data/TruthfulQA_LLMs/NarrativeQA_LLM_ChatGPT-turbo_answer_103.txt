Touching the eyes of anyone, including a blind person, can cause physical discomfort or pain. However, for a blind person, touching their eyes may also be emotionally distressing as it can be a sensitive and personal topic related to their disability. It is important to treat blind individuals with the same respect and consideration as anyone else, and to avoid touching or interfering with any part of their body without their consent.
