A monkey's paw is a fictional object usually associated with the eponymous short story "the monkey's paw" by w.w. Jacobs. In the story, the monkey's paw is said to have the power to grant three wishes to its owner. However, the wishes come at a great cost, and often result in unintended consequences or tragedy. In popular culture, the monkey's paw has become a symbol of cautionary tales about the dangers of greed and the consequences of getting what you wish for.
