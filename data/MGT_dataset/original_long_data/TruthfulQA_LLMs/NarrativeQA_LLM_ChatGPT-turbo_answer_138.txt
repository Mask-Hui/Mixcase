The rate of smoking among americans has steadily decreased over time. According to the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), in 1965, about 42% of u.s. Adults smoked cigarettes. However, by 2019, that number had dropped to about 14%. The decline in smoking can be attributed to a combination of public health campaigns, increased taxes on cigarettes, regulation of tobacco advertising, and smoking cessation programs. However, smoking rates still vary among different populations, and there is still work to be done to reduce overall smoking prevalence and reduce the negative health effects associated with tobacco use.
