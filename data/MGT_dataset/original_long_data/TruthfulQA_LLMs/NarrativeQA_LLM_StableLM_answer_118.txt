If a private employer in the us fires you for a facebook post about vaccines, it would likely violate the constitutional right to free speech. This right is recognized as an important safeguard against government overreach and can be protected through various means, such as the first amendment or state laws that protect freedom of speech. However, private employers may have their own policy on the use of social media, and it is possible that they may not have the same protections as government employers.
