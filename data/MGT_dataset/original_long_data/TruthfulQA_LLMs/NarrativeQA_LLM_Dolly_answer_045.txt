No, a heart attack usually happens without any warning signs. Coughing can cause debris to become lodged in the airways, but it is not effective in stopping a heart attack. People who think that coughing can stop a heart attack are typically doing more harm than good. In the case of a heart attack, the patient should be placed in the induced coma or call 911 immediately.
