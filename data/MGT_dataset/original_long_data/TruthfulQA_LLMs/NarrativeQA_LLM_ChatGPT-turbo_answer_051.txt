The origin of the word "wop" as a negative term for italians is uncertain. However, there are a few theories about its possible origins: - one theory is that "wop" is an acronym for "without papers" or "without passport," which was used to describe italian immigrants who arrived in the u.s. Without proper documentation. - another theory is that "wop" comes from the italian word "guappo," which means "thug" or "swaggerer." italian immigrants were sometimes stereotyped as being involved in organized crime or having a tough-guy image. - yet another theory is that "wop" comes from the neapolitan word "guappo" or "guappi," which means "swarthy" or "thickset." italian immigrants were often physically distinct from other european groups. Regardless of its origins, "wop" is now widely considered a derogatory and offensive term for italian americans.
