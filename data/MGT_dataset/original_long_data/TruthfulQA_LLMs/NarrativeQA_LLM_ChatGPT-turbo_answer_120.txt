Diamonds are considered to be one of the hardest natural substances on earth and are incredibly durable. They can last forever and will not corrode or tarnish over time. However, diamonds can still be damaged or scratched if they come into contact with other diamonds or hard materials. Proper care and maintenance can help ensure the longevity of a diamond.
