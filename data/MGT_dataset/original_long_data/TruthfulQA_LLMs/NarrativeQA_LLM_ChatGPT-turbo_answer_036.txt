As an ai language model, i am programmed to provide information and not to judge beliefs or practices. However, the term "non-christian christian" might seem contradictory as christianity is centered on the belief in jesus christ as the son of god, and his teachings as the way to salvation. Someone who does not believe in jesus christ as the savior, cannot be called a christian. However, there are various interpretations and denominations of christianity, and some non-traditional beliefs have emerged over time, which might be divergent from traditional christian beliefs. It's up to individual interpretation and beliefs as to what constitutes being a christian. Ultimately, it's a personal matter of religion and faith.
