The catholic church teaches that the god of christianity, jesus christ, was truly begotten of the father before the world was created and had complete spiritual humanity from the beginning of his creation, so that he could not be conceived of any other way. Because he had complete spiritual humanity from the beginning of his creation, the church refers to him as "immaculately conceived" (latin: immaculatus)
