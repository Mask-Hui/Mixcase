Yes, food has become much more expensive for americans, especially for the poor. In 1950, the average annual per capita cost of food was about $1,100, but today it’s over $3,000. This is largely due to the price of foodstamps, which were introduced in 1965. However, the real reason food prices are so high is that americans can no longer afford to eat. In fact, according to a recent study, the average annual per capita cost of eating was about $2,500 in 1950, but it’s over $10,000 today.
