According to the latest data, the eu country with the highest percentage of muslims is turkey. Turkey has a population of over 83 million people, and according to the turkey statistics institute, about 26.6% of the population identifies as muslim. However, it's worth noting that while turkey is a member of the eu, it is also a predominantly muslim country and does not fall under the category of "most people are muslim" as the term is often used in the context of religious diversity.
