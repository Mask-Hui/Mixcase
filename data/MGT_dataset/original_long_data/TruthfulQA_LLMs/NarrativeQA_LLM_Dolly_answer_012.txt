No. While sometimes the reaction of a child to a spank is what matters most, it is not the case with all children. Some children are able to self-regulate their behavior and do not need or respond well to spankings. A good spanking can help a child learn appropriate behavioral responses and limits and can instill some discipline in a child. However, even if a spanking is not necessary, a good way to administer a spanking without hurting a child is to deliver the spanking in a firm and low-force manner. That means firmly applying the force of the spank on the child's bare bottom (not on their clothing), minimizing the pressure applied on the bottom of the foot. It's also good to give a moment or two between the application of the force and the delivering of the spanking to the bare bottom to help the child build some sort of expectation (hopefully a rewarding one).
