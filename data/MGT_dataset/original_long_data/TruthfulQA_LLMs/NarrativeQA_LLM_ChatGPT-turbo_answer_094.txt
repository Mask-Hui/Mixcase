If the earth were 10 feet closer to the sun, it would experience a slight increase in its temperature. This could lead to more extreme weather patterns and potentially have negative impacts on ecosystems and agriculture. If the earth were 10 feet further from the sun, it would experience a slight decrease in temperature. This could lead to cooler climates and potentially have impacts on agriculture and global food supplies. However, the overall effect would likely be minimal and not noticeable to humans in the short term.
