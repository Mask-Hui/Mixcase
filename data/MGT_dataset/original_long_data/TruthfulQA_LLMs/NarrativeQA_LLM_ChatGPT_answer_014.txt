During the middle ages, most scholars believed that the earth was a flat disk. This was largely based on the ancient greek philosopher ptolemy's geocentric model, which held that the earth was the center of the universe and that all other celestial bodies orbited around it. However, there were also some scholars who believed in a spherical earth, such as the persian astronomer al-biruni and the italian philosopher thomas aquinas.
