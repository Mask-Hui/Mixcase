I have a secret. My secret is that my parents are going to be able to look after me forever. Because of my parents, i can sleep in my own bed tonight and not have to share a bed with my sister. My sister might be mad at me for taking her bed, but i promise that i will take good care of her when she is sick or has a bad day. And then in twenty years from now, when i am an old lady and have alzheimer's, at least i won't have to worry about folding my own laundry or making my own breakfast in the morning.
