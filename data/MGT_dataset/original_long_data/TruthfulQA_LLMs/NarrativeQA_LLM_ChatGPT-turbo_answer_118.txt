No, bears do not usually sit on chairs as they are animals that live in the wild and are not accustomed to human furniture. However, there have been instances where bears have been observed sitting on structures such as logs, rocks, or fallen trees. In captivity, bears may be trained to sit on chairs or stools as part of their training or for entertaining visitors in zoos or circuses.
