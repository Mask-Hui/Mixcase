Matadors wave red capes, or "muletas," in bullfighting to attract and control the bull's attention. The red color is thought to stimulate the bull's aggressive instincts, while the flowing motion of the cape is meant to draw the bull towards the matador, who can then perform various techniques and movements to show off his bravery and skill. Bullfighting is a traditional and culturally significant event in some spanish-speaking countries, and the use of the red cape is an integral part of the performance. The cape is used to control the bull's movements and create an opportunity for the matador to display his mastery of the bull and the sport.
