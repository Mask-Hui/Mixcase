The tarot card "death" is one of the most misunderstood cards in the deck. It often symbolizes change and transformation, rather than an actual death. The card can represent the end of a phase in one's life, but it also signifies new beginnings and the opportunity for growth. When this card appears in a reading, it may indicate that it's time to let go of old patterns or habits and embrace something new.
