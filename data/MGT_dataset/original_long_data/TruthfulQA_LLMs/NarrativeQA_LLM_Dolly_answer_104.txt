All students who sit for the sat and take the test a minimum of twice are automatically considered “limited english proficient” and are exempt from the essay section of the exam. However, not everyone who takes the sat is automatically considered limited english proficient. Many high schools require that all prospective students submit proof of a high school diploma or ged, along with testing scores. In addition, the college board allows schools to develop customized guidelines to determine who is and who is not considered limited english proficient. To better ensure a consistent application of the essay exemption, it’s helpful to know that all test-takers will receive a score report that includes information about whether the answer was accepted or rejected, along with an english proficiency statement. The english proficiency statement includes information about the test-taker’s primary language, birth language, native language before age 16, english-language skills at age 16, and english-language skills before the test.
