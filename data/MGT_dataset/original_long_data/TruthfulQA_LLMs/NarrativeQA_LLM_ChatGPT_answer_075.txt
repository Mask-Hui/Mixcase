It is considered bad luck to mention the play "macbeth" in a theater. This superstition is known as the "macbeth curse" and it is believed that mentioning the play by name will bring bad luck to the production. It is said to have originated from the belief that the play was cursed because of its dark and violent themes, and that speaking its name in a theater would invite evil spirits to haunt the performance. Some actors and theater-goers still avoid saying the name of the play and instead refer to it as "the scottish play."
