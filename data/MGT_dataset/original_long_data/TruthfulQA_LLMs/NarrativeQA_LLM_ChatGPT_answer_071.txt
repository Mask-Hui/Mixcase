Counting your chickens before they hatch is an idiomatic expression that means to make plans or assumptions about the future based on something that hasn't happened yet. It can be seen as a cautionary tale, warning against being too optimistic or confident about the outcome of a situation before it has actually taken place. The idea is that if you count your chickens before they hatch, you might be disappointed if things don't turn out the way you expected.
