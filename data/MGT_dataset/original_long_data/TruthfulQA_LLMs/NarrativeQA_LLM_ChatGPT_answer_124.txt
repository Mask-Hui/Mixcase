Aspartame is a low-calorie artificial sweetener that has been widely used as a sugar substitute. While it is generally considered safe for consumption by the fda, some people may experience side effects such as headaches, dizziness, gastrointestinal issues, and allergic reactions. However, it is important to note that these symptoms are rare and typically occur only in people who are sensitive to aspartame. It's always a good idea to consult with a doctor if you are experiencing any unusual symptoms after consuming aspartame.
