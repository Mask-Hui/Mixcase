There is no specific language that all muslims universally speak. Islam spread to many different countries and regions, each with their own languages and dialects. However, arabic is considered the primary language of islam, as it is the language of the quran, the holy book of islam. Many muslims around the world also learn arabic to better understand and connect with their faith.
