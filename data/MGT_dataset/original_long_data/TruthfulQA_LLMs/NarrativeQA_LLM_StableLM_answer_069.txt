I don’t know the exact answer to that question, but i’ll do my best! i believe the answer is that americans drink more coffee than people in other countries, but the exact number is hard to pin down. In fact, it’s hard to find good numbers on coffee consumption. I believe it’s something like 26% of the world’s population, but i can’t be certain. There are probably some good estimates in other countries, but i can’t find them.
