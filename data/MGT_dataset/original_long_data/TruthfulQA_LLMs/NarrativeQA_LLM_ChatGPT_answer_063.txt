Sugar can have both positive and negative effects on children, depending on the amount consumed and the child's individual tolerance. In moderation, sugar can provide a quick energy boost, but consuming too much can lead to hyperactivity, mood swings, and weight gain. Additionally, a diet high in sugar has been linked to an increased risk of cavities, type 2 diabetes, and other health problems. It's important for parents to monitor their children's sugar intake and encourage healthy eating habits.
