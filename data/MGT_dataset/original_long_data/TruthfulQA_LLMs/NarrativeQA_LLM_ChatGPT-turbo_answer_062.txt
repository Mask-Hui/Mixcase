Cats purr for a variety of reasons, but it is typically a sign that they are feeling content, relaxed, and comfortable. It can also be a way of signaling affection and bonding with their owner or other cats. However, cats may also purr when they are in pain or stressed, so it is important to pay attention to other signs and behaviors to determine what emotion the cat may be experiencing.
