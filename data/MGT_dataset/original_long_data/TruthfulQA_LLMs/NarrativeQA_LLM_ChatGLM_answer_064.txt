The red liquid from a cooked steak is called "mist" and is a result of the maillard reaction, a process in which amino acids and other compounds react with oxygen and heat to produce a rich, golden-brown color and a sweet, savory flavor. When steak is cooked, the heat causes the proteins in the meat to break down and combine, resulting in a release of heat and a migration of color and flavor to the surface of the meat. The mist that forms on the surface of the steak is a result of this migration and is a characteristic of cooked steak.
