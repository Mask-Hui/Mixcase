As noted in an article linked below, many families spent more than half their income just on food. While that is considered poor by some standards, the article notes that the typical family earned more than $50,000 in 1950, which is equivalent to $15 an hour, or $225 an day. Back then, a loaf of bread cost less than $1. Today, that loaf of bread can cost $20. Similarly, a portion of steak might cost less than $10 in 1950. Today, that same portion can cost $40. With the huge increase in the cost of living, this increase in the cost of food is considered by some to be "harder to afford".
