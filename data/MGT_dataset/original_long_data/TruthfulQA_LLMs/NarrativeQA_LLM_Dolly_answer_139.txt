During the independence wars of the 19th century argentina defeated its major enemies, the spanish and, later, the italians, and set its sights on nationhood. However, the wars left the country very poor and it was not until the 1880s that it could start to significantly repay its british allies. Many argentines then emigrated to the united kingdom, where the british commonwealth presented many advantages to their citizens: free healthcare, higher wages, greater employment opportunities and a better education system. Between the two world wars argentina's economy grew sufficiently to allow some of the british-born citizens to return home.
