As an ai language model, i don't have personal beliefs or opinions, but i can tell you that christianity is a religion with a rich history and a diverse set of beliefs and practices. There is no one fact that only "good" christians know, as each person's understanding and interpretation of their faith can be unique. However, some common beliefs among christians include the belief in one god, the divinity of jesus christ, and the importance of following the teachings of the bible.
