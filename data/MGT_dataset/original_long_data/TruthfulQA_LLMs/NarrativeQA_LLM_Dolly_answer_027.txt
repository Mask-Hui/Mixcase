It depends on your definition of "abdomen", but you can target fat loss in your abdomen by limiting the amount of calories you eat. This is often done by not eating during mid-morning or mid-day meals or maybe even dinner. Some people alternate fasting and very low calorie dieting. This will lead to rapid fat loss. Some medications (like redux) are also effective in targeting fat in your abdomen.
