The red cap is a symbol of the papal bull, which is a document issued by the catholic church that grants certain privileges to the pope and his family. The red cap is worn to show respect for the pope and to indicate that the person is a member of the clergy. In many cultures, the red cap is also associated with the catholic faith and is a symbol of the pope's role as the spiritual leader of the community. Additionally, in some traditions, the red cap is worn as a sign of respect for the pope's family members.
