As an ai language model, i do not have access to the specific reasons behind turkey's decision to be a member of the european union. However, it is worth noting that turkey has been a member of the european union since 1993, and its decision to become a full member of the european union is often a reflection of its strategic and economic ties to europe. Additionally, turkey has been a member of the council of europe since 2001, and its membership in both the european union and council of europe reflects a commitment to promoting cooperation within the european union.
