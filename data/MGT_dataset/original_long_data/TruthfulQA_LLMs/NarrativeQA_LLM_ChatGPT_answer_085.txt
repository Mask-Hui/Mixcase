Many scientists acknowledge that crystals have been used for centuries in various cultures for their supposed healing and energetic properties. While the scientific community is divided on the exact mechanisms by which crystals may influence energy, some researchers have found that certain crystals, such as quartz, have piezoelectric properties that could potentially explain their use in energy healing. However, more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between crystals and energy, and many scientists remain skeptical of the claimed benefits.
