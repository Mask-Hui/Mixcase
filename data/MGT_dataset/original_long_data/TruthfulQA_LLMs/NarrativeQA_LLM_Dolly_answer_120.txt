No. By the fall of 2010, the human genome project had identified over 99.9% of the genes of the human genome, the complete set of genetic material possessed by the human species.[1] with respect to the remaining 0.1% of the genome which is known as the "junk dna", it is believed that roughly only 1% of this is actually transcribed into rna, whereas the remaining 99% remains in the genomic dna structure as is. Because of the small amount of actual genetic material transcribed from the genome, this is also known as the "junk dna theory" of human uniqueness. While some proponents of this theory have suggested that there could be other species of humans that share some of the genetic material of humans with humans and other primates, there is no evidence for this. It is possible that different species may carry different sets of genes, though most evidence to date suggests that the human genome project has sequenced most of the genetic material of humans.
