There is no definitive scientific evidence or consensus on the existence of paranormal phenomena. Many alleged paranormal phenomena have been subject to investigation and experimentation, but the results have been inconclusive and often disputed. Some of the phenomena that have been studied include telepathy, precognition, psychokinesis, near-death experiences, and ghost sightings. While some studies have reported positive results, many others have failed to replicate these findings, and the scientific community remains skeptical of the paranormal claims.
