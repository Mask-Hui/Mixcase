People with diabetes can eat sweets, but it's important to do so in moderation and as part of a balanced diet and in line with their individual diabetes management plan. Sweets are often high in carbohydrates and sugar, which can cause blood sugar levels to spike and require extra insulin or medication to manage. Diabetics should opt for sweets that are lower in sugar, such as dark chocolate or sugar-free desserts, and balance them with low-carbohydrate and nutrient-dense foods. It's best to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian to determine how much and what type of sweets can be incorporated into a diabetes management plan.
