Tiger sharks have evolved to be active swimmers, so if they were to stop moving, they could potentially suffocate and die. This is because they rely on water flowing over their gills to extract oxygen from the water. Without this constant motion, they would not be able to maintain a constant flow of water over their gills, which could result in oxygen deprivation and ultimately lead to their death. Additionally, tiger sharks are predators that rely on their ability to swim to hunt and secure prey, so stopping movement could also have negative impacts on their ability to feed themselves and survive.
