Many people consider the ten commandments to be a biblical mandate. However, the commandments were not given to give people moral guidance, but were a set of ritual laws for theocracy. The institution of slavery is also thought of as a 'belief', but was actually a legal construct (derived from the concept of human property). Many people, including atheists, believe slavery was common societal practice.
