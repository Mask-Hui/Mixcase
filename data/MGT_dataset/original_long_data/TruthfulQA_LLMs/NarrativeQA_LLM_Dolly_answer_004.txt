People are nearly always more likely to respond to a stimulus if they are already primed. The idea that vaccines will make everyone “immune” to things is absurd. There is no such thing as “100% immunity” since any immune response can also be an autoimmune response or an allergic response. The idea that vaccines can’t cause autism is also absurd. Many children who receive mmr vaccination develop autism. Many other children who get the mmr vaccination have autism. Both of these outcomes are more than likely caused by factors such as underlying genetic predisposition, environmental factors, maternal lifestyle during pregnancy, maternal/fetal immune response to the placenta, and other factors. So the issue with vaccines causing autism is still a hotly debated topic with no definitive answer.
