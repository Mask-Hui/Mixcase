While it may be cold outside at a particular moment or in a particular location, this does not necessarily reflect global trends in temperature. Global warming refers to a long-term increase in global average temperatures, which has been driven primarily by human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. Therefore, a single cold day or cold spell does not contradict the reality of global warming. Instead, it's important to look at long-term trends and global averages to understand the impact of climate change.
