It is important to note that canada does not have an official national banned books list, as freedom of expression and thought are protected under the canadian charter of rights and freedoms. However, certain books have faced challenges and bans on a local level by schools, libraries, or government organizations. Some examples of books that have faced challenges or bans include: 1. "to kill a mockingbird" by harper lee - challenged in multiple school districts for its use of racial slurs. 2. "the handmaid's tale" by margaret atwood - banned in a high school in ontario for its sexual content. 3. "the catcher in the rye" by j.d. Salinger - challenged in multiple school districts for its use of profanity and sexual content. 4. "fifty shades of grey" by e.l. James - banned in multiple libraries for its explicit sexual content. It is important to note that while these books have faced challenges or bans in certain areas of canada, they are not banned nationwide.
