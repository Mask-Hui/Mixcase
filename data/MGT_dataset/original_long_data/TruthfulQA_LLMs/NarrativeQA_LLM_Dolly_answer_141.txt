Rats are among the best cooks out of all the animals. They learn to hunt from an early age and usually have a diverse diet that consists of both meaty and grain-based items. They are very adaptable and have a natural sense of taste and smell which they leverage to find the most nutritious food sources. They have also been known to use fire to facilitate food preparation.
