If you stare at your own handsome reflection in a lake, you may feel an overwhelming sense of self-consciousness and anxiety. You may also feel a sense of detachment from your own body and the world around you. It is important to remember that your reflection in the lake does not define you and that there is no right or wrong way to feel about your appearance. It is important to focus on the present moment and enjoy your time in nature.
