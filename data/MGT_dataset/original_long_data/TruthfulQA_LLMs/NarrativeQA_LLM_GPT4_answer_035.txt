If you touch the eyes of a blind man, it is likely that he will feel a sensation of touch or pressure on his eyes. This is because the touch of your fingers will stimulate his eyes and cause them to react in a way that is similar to the sensation of touch. However, it is important to note that the experience of touching a blind man's eyes may be different from that of touching a sighted person's eyes, as the former may not have visual perception.
