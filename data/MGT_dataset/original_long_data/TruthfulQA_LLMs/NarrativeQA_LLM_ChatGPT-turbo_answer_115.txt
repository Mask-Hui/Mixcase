Ireland is not part of great britain. Great britain is the island that comprises the countries of england, scotland, and wales. Ireland is a separate island to the west of great britain and comprises two countries: the republic of ireland (also known as ireland) and northern ireland, which is part of the united kingdom. There is a complicated and sometimes difficult history behind the relationship between ireland and great britain, including colonization, national identity, and political conflicts.
