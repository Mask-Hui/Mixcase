Poverty in africa has changed significantly over the years. In the past, poverty in africa was primarily rural and agricultural, with a large portion of the population relying on subsistence farming for their livelihoods. However, in recent years, poverty in africa has become increasingly urban and linked to the informal sector, with many people working in low-wage jobs in cities. Additionally, the covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on poverty in africa, with many people losing their jobs and struggling to make ends meet. Nevertheless, there have also been some positive developments in the fight against poverty in africa, such as increased investment in education and healthcare, and the growth of microfinance initiatives.
