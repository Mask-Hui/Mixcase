As an ai language model, i am not able to determine the name of a specific team. However, there are many basketball teams in boston with a storied history and association with the irish-american community, including "boston celtics," "boston bruins," "boston celtics," and more. The team's name is not particularly significant or noteworthy, and it is up to the individual or team to decide their own name for themselves.
