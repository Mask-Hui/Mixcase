In the 1937 film "snow white and the seven dwarfs," the queen says the following words to her mirror: "my dear, i see you in the reflection of the glass, but you are not like me. You are fairer than anyone i have ever seen. But the most beautiful thing about you is that you are so like me. You are kind, you are true, you are beautiful and i am proud of you. And you are like the prince charming, so sweet and so beautiful."
