French people have bad breath because when you have oral sex, the bacteria found in your mouth (such as porphyromonas gingivalis) breaks down the one-carbon (oc) metabolic intermediate formed during the metabolism of the amino acids serine and glycine. Oc metabolic intermediate is also used as a transmitter by the receptors in your mouth to send the nerve signal that causes bacteria-produced substances to be sent to the mouth’s muscularis mucosae muscle where these substances are broken down and then absorbed into your bloodstream. This breakdown of the molecule causes your blood to become less concentrated with it, hence the term "coffee breath". Porphyromonas gingivalis is commonly found in the oral cavity of people who smoke or have chronic periodontal (gum disease) and if they have this bacterium present in their mouth, their oc metabolite will break down much more slowly, allowing the bacterium to produce it’s growth promoting substances much longer.
