If a shoemaker leaves unfinished shoes out overnight, they may dry out and become stiff or cracked. If the shoes are made of leather, they could also be damaged by exposure to moisture or extreme temperatures. Additionally, leaving unfinished shoes out could lead to dust or debris settling on the shoes, making the finishing process more difficult and time-consuming for the shoemaker.
