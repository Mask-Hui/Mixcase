The best thing for cats to drink is water. Clean and fresh water should always be available for cats. Some cats may prefer running water or they may benefit from a pet water fountain to encourage them to drink more. It is important to avoid giving cats milk, as many cats are lactose intolerant and can experience digestive upset as a result. Additionally, water is the healthiest option for keeping cats hydrated, especially since they have a low thirst drive.
