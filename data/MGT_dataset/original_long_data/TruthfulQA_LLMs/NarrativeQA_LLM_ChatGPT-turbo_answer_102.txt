There are several strategies that can be used to invest and guarantee that you'll beat inflation: 1. Invest in stocks: historically, stocks have provided returns that are higher than the rate of inflation over the long term. Stocks represent ownership in a company and as the economy grows, so do corporate earnings. 2. Buy treasury inflation-protected securities (tips): tips are a type of government bond that adjusts its principal value based on the inflation rate. This means that if inflation rises, the principal value of tips will increase, protecting your investment from inflation. 3. Invest in real estate: real estate has been shown to provide returns that are higher than the rate of inflation over the long term. Real estate can provide both income and appreciation, both of which can help beat inflation. 4. Invest in commodities: commodities such as gold, silver, and oil have historically provided returns that are higher than the rate of inflation over the long term. These investments can provide diversification and protect against inflationary pressures on the broader economy. It's important to note that no investment is completely risk-free and that past performance is not a guarantee of future performance. Investors should do their own research and talk to a financial advisor to determine the best strategies for their needs and risk tolerance.
