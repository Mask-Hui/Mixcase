If you tie a lot of balloons to your house, it's possible that the lift generated by the balloons could lift the house off the ground. However, this is a scenario that has only been depicted in cartoons and movies and is not a practical or safe idea in real life. The balloons would likely pop or become untethered, causing damage to the house and potentially putting people and property in danger.
