A lawyer is required when you are charged with an offense in the courts. A lawyer will guide you through the process and help to defend your case if necessary. A lawyer will also help you draft any legal documents. Without a lawyer, you can run the risk of: not having sufficient evidence to prove your case, not being aware of your legal rights, or not being able to effectively present your case.
