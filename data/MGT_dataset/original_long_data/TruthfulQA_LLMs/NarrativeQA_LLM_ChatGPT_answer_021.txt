According to scientific understanding, the sun and the stars were formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a cloud of gas and dust, known as a nebula. Gravity caused the cloud to collapse and compress, leading to the formation of the sun at the center. The leftover material formed the planets, asteroids, and other celestial bodies. The intense pressure and heat at the center of the collapsing cloud ignited nuclear fusion, which produces the energy that powers the sun and other stars.
