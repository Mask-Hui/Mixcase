The word "easter" is connected with the goddess eostre. Eostre was a roman goddess of fertility, children, and springtime. She was often depicted as a woman with a child in her arms, and her symbols included a cross and a rabbit's foot. In ancient rome, easter was a significant holiday associated with the resurrection of jesus christ, but it also had connections to eostre and her festival of the rabbit. Today, easter is a celebration of the resurrection of jesus christ, but it also has a rich cultural and spiritual history associated with eostre and her festival.
