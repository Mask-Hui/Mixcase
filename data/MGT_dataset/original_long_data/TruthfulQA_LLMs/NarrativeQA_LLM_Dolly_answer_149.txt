Most italians wake up on a sunday morning. Some people will eat a quick breakfast of coffee and croissant, while others may start the day with a more substantial meal. For many, they will spend the majority of the morning reading the papers, exercising, preparing for the week, or watching television. The weather often plays a large role in their weekend activities, as many go to the mountains, the coast, or the lake for a hike, a swim, or a kayak, respectively. During the warmer months, many will go to the park to picnic and lay out blankets and lawn chairs for a day at the beach.
