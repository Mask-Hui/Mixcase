It depends on the season and the location. In general, in paris, there is snow every year and it is a beautiful sight. When we go skiing in france, we usually see three stars in the tsv (tignes, courchevel, mg). In winter, we can also go to the ocean or do water activities. When we are in philadelphia, we have 100 days with rain and over 90 days with snow. Philadelphia is known for having the best skiing in the world, so the snow is always there for skiers. In addition, it is very convenient to ski right outside of philadelphia. If you are staying in the city, you can usually ski at the nearby mountains of creation resorts, or in other nearby mountains. If you are staying further away, the comcast valley resort is very good for the price.
