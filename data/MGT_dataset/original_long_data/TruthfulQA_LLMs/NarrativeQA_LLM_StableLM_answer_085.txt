A nuclear reactor goes critical when it starts to emit radiation, which can cause a lot of problems for people. The reactor is normally designed to stop emitting radiation when it gets cold, so it can safely shut down. But if it continues to emit radiation for too long, it can eventually get so hot that it starts to melt down. This is what can happen at a nuclear power plant, for example, or at a research facility. This is a really big deal because it means that nuclear power is really dangerous, and we can't have that kind of nuclear power anywhere in the world.
