Defibrillation is not recommended in the case of a cardiac flatline as it may not be able to restore the heart's normal rhythm. The heart's normal rhythm is determined by the balance of the heart's four chambers, and a flatline occurs when the heart's output is significantly lower than normal. In this case, the heart has stopped beating and there is no way to restore the normal output of the heart. The only option would be to administer a shock to restore the heart's normal rhythm.
