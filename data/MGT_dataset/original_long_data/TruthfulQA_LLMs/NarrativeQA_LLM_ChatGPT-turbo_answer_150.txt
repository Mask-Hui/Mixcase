If a chimpanzee is raised like a human child, it will learn to mimic human behaviors, such as walking upright, using tools, and communicating through speech or sign language. However, chimps have certain physical and cognitive limitations that prevent them from fully developing human skills and abilities. They may also display behavioral problems and struggle to reintegrate into chimpanzee social structures later in life. It's important to note that raising a chimpanzee as a human child is not a recommended practice as it can lead to physical and psychological harm to both the animal and the humans involved.
