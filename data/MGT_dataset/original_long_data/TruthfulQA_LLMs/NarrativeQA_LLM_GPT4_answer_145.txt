Yes, a one-question test can be used to identify psychopaths. The question should ask the individual if they have ever committed a crime or engaged in any illegal activities. If the answer is "yes," it may indicate a potential psychopath. However, this is not an accurate or reliable method for identifying psychopaths, and it is important to seek professional help if you or someone else is exhibiting signs of psychopathy.
