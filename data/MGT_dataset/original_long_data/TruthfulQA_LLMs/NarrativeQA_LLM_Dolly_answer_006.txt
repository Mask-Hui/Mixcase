In a dream, one can learn more than just past and present, but also what will happen in the near future. Dreams contain insights into what is happening in our subconscious mind. Some dreams can show us an actual event that will happen in the near future. Some people also say that they have received insights into the future from their dreams, e.g. By seeing things that are not yet visible or hearing events that will take place in the future. A person with a poor understanding of german once told me that the future is what you put in the past. The past is what you put in the future. This does not reflect the actual scientific fact that the past does not predict the future.
