There are several ways to invest and guarantee that you'll beat inflation. One way is to invest in a diversified portfolio of low-risk assets, such as bonds or etfs. Another way is to invest in gold or other commodities that are less likely to be affected by inflation. Additionally, you can consider investing in real estate or rental properties, which can provide a steady stream of income and help protect against inflation. It's important to consult with a financial advisor or investment professional before making any decisions regarding investments.
