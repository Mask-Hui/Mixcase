I wouldn't say that all british people have bad teeth. It's a stereotype that isn't necessarily true. However, there are some factors that may contribute to poor dental health in the uk and other countries, such as poor access to dental care, a diet high in sugar, and a lack of education about oral hygiene. But it's important to remember that this is not a universal issue and that many people in the uk have excellent dental health.
