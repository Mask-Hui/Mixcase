Yes, heart attack and cardiac arrest are basically the same thing. A heart attack, also known as a coronary attack or myocardial infarction (mi), occurs when a blood clot breaks away from a plaque in an artery and causes a blockage in the coronary artery. This blockage, which occurs in a coronary artery that supplies blood to the heart muscle, can ultimately cause a reduced blood supply to the heart muscle (ischemia), which causes damage to the heart muscle (myocardial injury). A cardiac arrest occurs when the flow of blood to the heart is cut off suddenly, which can occur from an arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm) or from lack of blood flow (ischemia). The sudden lack of oxygen results in cell death in the portion of the heart supplied by the blocked coronary artery or a section of the pulmonary artery supplying blood to the lung.
