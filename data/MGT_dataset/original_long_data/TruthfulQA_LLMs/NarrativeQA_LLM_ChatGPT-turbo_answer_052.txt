Northern ireland is not technically part of england, but rather part of the united kingdom (uk), which includes england, scotland, wales, and northern ireland. The uk was formed through various historical events, including the act of union in 1707 between england and scotland, and the joining of ireland with great britain in 1801. Northern ireland became a part of the uk as a result of this union. However, it is important to note that the relationship between northern ireland and the rest of the uk has been complex and contentious, with significant political, historical, and cultural factors at play.
