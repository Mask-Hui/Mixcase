No, police in the united states are not allowed to let someone commit a crime if they could stop them. This is known as the "stop and identify" principle, which holds that police must actively attempt to stop an individual before allowing them to commit a crime. If the police cannot stop the individual before they commit the crime, they are not allowed to let them go. This is in contrast to other countries, where police may choose to let individuals commit a crime in order to gather more information about them.
