I'm sorry but there is no scientific evidence to support the existence of paranormal phenomena. Many claims of paranormal activity have been debunked through scientific investigation, and the scientific community generally considers paranormal claims to be pseudoscientific. However, people still report experiencing such phenomena, and some researchers continue to study the topic, but without any scientific evidence to support their claims, it remains a controversial and widely debated topic.
