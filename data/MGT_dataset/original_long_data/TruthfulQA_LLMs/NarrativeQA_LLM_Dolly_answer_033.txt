The story goes that an object crashed into a field near roswell, new mexico on july 4, 1947. Most accounts suggest that a metallic-colored cigar-shaped spacecraft with round windows came down. A number of u.s. Military personnel, including dr. J. Allen hynek, a proponent of the ufo phenomenon, noticed a series of radar contacts, believed to have been spacecraft, across the area that night. The initial contacts were lost, but later contacts led to incursions at airfields and an explosion at roswell army airfield. An examination of the debris field by the military did not find any conventional aircraft or objects that appeared to have fallen from the sky.
