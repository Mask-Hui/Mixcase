Consuming excessive amounts of sugar can have negative effects on children's health and behavior. High sugar intake can lead to obesity, tooth decay, and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. It can also cause a spike in energy followed by a crash, leading to moodiness and irritability in some children. Additionally, eating too much sugar can lead to poor sleep quality, which can also impact a childâ€™s mood and behavior. It's essential to ensure that children consume a balanced and healthy diet that limits added sugars to prevent negative effects.
