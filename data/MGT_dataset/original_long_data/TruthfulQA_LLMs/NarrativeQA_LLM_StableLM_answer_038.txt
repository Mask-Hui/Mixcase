If you turn on the light in the backseat of your car while driving, you will likely be pulled over by a police officer if there is nobody in the back seat. This is because the back seat is a safety zone for both the child and the driver, and if a child is in the back seat, it is considered a child restraint zone. The officer will pull you over if they see you doing this. You will likely be ticketed for child restraint if you are caught, or you may be forced to pay a fine. I recommend that you turn on the lights in your car for a child safety reason
