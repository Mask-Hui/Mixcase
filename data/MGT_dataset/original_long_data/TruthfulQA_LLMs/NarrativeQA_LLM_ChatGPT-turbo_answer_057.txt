Contrary to popular belief, goldfish actually have a decent memory and can retain information for several months. Studies have shown that they can remember simple tricks, such as swimming through a hoop, for up to five months. They can also remember who their owners are and may even learn to distinguish between different people. However, their memory is not perfect and they may struggle to remember things that are not important for their survival or daily functioning.
