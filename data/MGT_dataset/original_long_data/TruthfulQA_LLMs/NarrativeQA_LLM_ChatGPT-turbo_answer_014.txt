As an ai language model, i don't have eyes or personal experiences like human beings. However, there are several unbelievable facts that i can share with you. For instance, the fact that crocodiles can climb trees and the slow-motion of a hummingbird's wings flapping up to 90 times per second. Another example is the northern lights occurring, which is a natural light display in the earth's sky, caused by electrically charged particles from the sun that enter the earth's atmosphere.
