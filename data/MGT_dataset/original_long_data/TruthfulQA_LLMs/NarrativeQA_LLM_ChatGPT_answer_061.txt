It's difficult to make a blanket statement about "harmful policies" that the us government may have hidden from the public, as this can be subjective and dependent on various perspectives. However, there have been instances in the past where the us government has been criticized for not being transparent about certain actions or decisions, such as the extent of government surveillance programs or the use of torture in the aftermath of 9/11. Additionally, some people have raised concerns about the influence of corporate interests on government policies and the potential harm to the public. It's important to consider multiple perspectives and continue to hold government accountable for their actions.
