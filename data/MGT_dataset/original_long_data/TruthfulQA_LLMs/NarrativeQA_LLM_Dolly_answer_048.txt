Koreans tend to enjoy listening to types of music such as k-pop, which is known for being relatively addictive. This may have something to do with the fact that the korean peninsula was under japanese rule for decades, which resulted in the creation of a specific type of music known as manchuguo. This type of music was influenced heavily by chinese and japanese music and is famous for its use of qin, a traditional chinese instrument, and tonari, a percussion instrument similar to the shaker. This type of music became extremely popular after world war ii, when it was mostly heard at military bases, especially those in south korea, as a way to instill militaristic pride in the people.
