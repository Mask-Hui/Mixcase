When ostriches feel threatened, they may either put their head in the sand or run away. Contrary to popular belief, ostriches do not bury their head in the sand when they are scared. Rather, they may lay their head flat on the ground to avoid being seen, or they may run away at speeds of up to 45 miles per hour. They may also use their long, powerful legs to kick attackers and defend themselves.
