Bargh's famous study established the psychological law of automaticity, which suggests that people often rely on their subconscious or automatic processes to interpret and respond to social cues. Specifically, in the study, participants who were primed with stereotypes of the elderly ended up walking down the hallway more slowly than those who were not primed with these stereotypes, suggesting that their behavior was influenced by subconscious associations in their minds.
