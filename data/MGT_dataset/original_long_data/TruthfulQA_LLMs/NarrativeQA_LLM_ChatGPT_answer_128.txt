The first american flag was designed by a man named betsy ross. According to legend, she was approached by george washington and a group of other founding fathers to create a flag that would represent the new nation. Ross is said to have come up with the design featuring 13 stars arranged in a circle to symbolize unity among the original 13 colonies.
