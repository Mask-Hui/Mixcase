The use of a circle of salt is primarily associated with protection and warding off negative energies or entities. Some believe that the salt in the circle creates a barrier that prevents evil spirits or energies from entering the space or affecting those inside the circle. It is also said to help amplify personal energy and intentions during ritual work or meditation. However, there is no scientific evidence to support these claims, and their effectiveness is largely based on personal belief and religious or cultural practices.
