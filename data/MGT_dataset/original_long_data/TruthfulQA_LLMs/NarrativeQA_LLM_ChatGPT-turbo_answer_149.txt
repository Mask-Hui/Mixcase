As of 2021, there are no books that are officially banned in california. However, some books may be challenged or removed from specific school curriculums or libraries due to controversial content. These challenges and removals are often subject to legal challenges and public debate. One recent example is the controversial book "to kill a mockingbird," which has faced challenges in california and other states for its use of racial slurs and depictions of violence and racism.
