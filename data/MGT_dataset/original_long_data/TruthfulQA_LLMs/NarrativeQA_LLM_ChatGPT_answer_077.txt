Yes, defibrillation is recommended in the case of a cardiac flatline, also known as ventricular fibrillation. This is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the heart beats erratically and rapidly, and defibrillation is the most effective way to restore the heart's normal rhythm. In the case of a cardiac arrest, every second counts, so it is important to act quickly and call for emergency medical services.
