Many say that "shit" originated from the sound of car tires on loose gravel, which the irish say was what they called an "shite" (a curse word in that accent). However, the origins of the word actually go back to the old english "sitten." in fact, the word "sitten" can still be found in modern-day scotland and northern england, where it means "shit" as well. Interestingly, in old english, the verb "siten" meant "to smell," which may help to explain why we still hear people in those areas refer to "smells" as "sits."
