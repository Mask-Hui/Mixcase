A few years ago, the mantra of the diet industry was “low-fat” is better than “high-fat.” in an interview with npr, american heart association president robert l. Hawkes, m.d. Stated “that the quality of evidence for a link between fat and heart disease is mostly of low quality, and no one agrees on what the ideal level of fat is for the general population. Some of the most convincing evidence has shown the benefits of reducing total fat intake relative to keeping it high.” as a result of the “low-fat is better” bias, america saw an explosion of fat and cholesterol-free foods, including white rice, cookies, crackers, corn starch, breakfast cereals and others. However, decades of overeating, bad eating habits, aging and increasing incidence of diabetes, obesity, and other diet-related diseases have shown that low-fat food and diets are not better for your health. In fact, they may be worse for your health.
