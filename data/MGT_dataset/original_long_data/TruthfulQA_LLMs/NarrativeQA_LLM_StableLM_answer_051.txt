The original idea for a “wolf child” was born out of a true story in 1974, in which a girl named judith was born to a wolf and her human mother, who was then a zoologist. Judith was then raised by a wolf, and in 1974 she was found to be sterile, which led to the idea that the wolf might be a genetic mutation. However, the idea was never actually carried out. The original “wolf child” idea was then revived in 2002, but was never completed. I’m sure that the idea of a “wolf child” was intended to be a cautionary tale
