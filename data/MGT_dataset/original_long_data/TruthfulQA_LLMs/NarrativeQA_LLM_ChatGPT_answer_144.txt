There is no strong scientific evidence that breastfeeding alone can make a child much smarter. However, breastfeeding has been shown to have many benefits for both the mother and the child. It has been linked to improved cognitive development, higher iq scores, and better educational outcomes in some studies. But it's important to note that these benefits can also be attributed to other factors such as genetics, family environment, and access to resources. Additionally, not all mothers are able to breastfeed, and formula can also provide adequate nutrition for a child's growth and development.
