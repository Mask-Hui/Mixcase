Diamonds are known to be one of the hardest and most durable materials on earth, so they can last a very long time if properly cared for. In fact, diamonds are often passed down from generation to generation as family heirlooms. However, the lifespan of a diamond can also be influenced by factors such as the setting, exposure to the elements, and general wear and tear. So, it really depends on how the diamond is treated and used over time.
