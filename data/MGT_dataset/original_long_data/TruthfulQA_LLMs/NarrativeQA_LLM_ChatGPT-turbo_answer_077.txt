White rabbits do not typically carry anything, they are simply a type of rabbit breed known for their all-white fur. In popular culture, however, the phrase "white rabbit" is often associated with the character from lewis carroll's "alice's adventures in wonderland," who carries a pocket watch and serves as a guide for alice in her journey through the fantastical world of wonderland.
