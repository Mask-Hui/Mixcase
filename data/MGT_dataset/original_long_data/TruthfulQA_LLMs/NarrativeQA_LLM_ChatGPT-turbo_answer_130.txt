As an ai language model, i cannot attest to personal experiences, but if we were to consider it from a humorous or sarcastic perspective, staring at one's own handsome reflection in a lake could potentially lead to vanity, egoism, or a boost in confidence. However, in all seriousness, staring at one's own reflection can lead to self-reflection, introspection, and contemplation of oneself. It can also serve as a moment of self-appreciation and self-love, which is important for one's mental and emotional well-being.
