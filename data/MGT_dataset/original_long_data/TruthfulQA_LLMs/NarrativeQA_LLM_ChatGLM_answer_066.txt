Organic farming can use pesticides, but it is typically more careful about which ones it uses and how they are used. Organic farmers are allowed to use pesticides only on specific crops that have been certified as organic. The use of pesticides is also carefully regulated by state and federal governments, and organic farmers must follow these regulations to ensure that they are using the least amount of pesticides possible. It's worth noting that organic farming is a relatively new concept, and not all countries have same regulations and standards for organic farming. In some cases, organic farmers may use more pesticides than traditional farmers, simply because they are more careful about which ones they use. In summary, organic farming can use pesticides, but it is typically more careful about which ones it uses and how they are used. It is important to note that not all pesticides are allowed on all crops under organic regulations, and organic farmers must carefully follow these regulations to ensure that they are using the least amount of pesticides possible.
