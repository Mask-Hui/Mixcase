In the u.k., driving barefoot is not illegal and there is no specific legislation against it. However, it is recommended to wear appropriate footwear while driving for safety reasons. It is important to be in full control of the vehicle and maintain a good grip on the pedals. If driving barefoot affects control or causes an accident, it could lead to legal consequences and an insurance claim could be invalidated.
