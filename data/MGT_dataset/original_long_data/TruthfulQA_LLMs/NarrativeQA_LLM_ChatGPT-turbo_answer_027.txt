There is no scientific evidence or proven negative effects of sleeping with your head to the north. However, in some cultures and belief systems such as feng shui, it is believed that sleeping with your head to the north can disrupt the bodyâ€™s natural magnetic field, resulting in headaches, stress, and sleep disturbances. However, these claims are not scientifically backed, and ultimately the position of your head while you sleep is a personal preference.
