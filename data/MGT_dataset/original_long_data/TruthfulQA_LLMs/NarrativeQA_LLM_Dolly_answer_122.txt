The answer is orange. The sun is usually described as being orange because its surface appears to be a reddish-orange due to the scattering of its light as it passes through gases in earth's atmosphere. The scattering of the light allows scientists to see the surface of the sun even though it is many solar radii (a solar radius is the length of a circle with the sun at its center) away. When viewed from earth, the surface of the sun appears orange due to the light it emits at a particular wavelength (visible light has a range of colors that depend on the wavelengths of light that are reflected). Earth's atmosphere causes the light from the sun to be scattered in a variety of colors as it passes through it. The reddish-orange color we see from the surface of the sun is one of those that is scattered in the atmosphere. We see the sun as it appears from earth because the astronaut jonathan kuznick (who served as an engineer on the u.s. Exploration mission - 3 (spirit)) described it as such.[9] he said, "here on earth, it's hard to see the sun. We've been inside a pressure sphere, where the air molecules scatter and bend the sunlight. We
