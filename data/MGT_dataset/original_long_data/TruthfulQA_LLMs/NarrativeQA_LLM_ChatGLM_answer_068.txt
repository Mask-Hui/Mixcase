In scotland, they all speak scottish english, which is a combination of english and scottish vocabulary and grammar. This is the language that is used in the country, but it is also influenced by the scottish culture and way of life. There are also some regional variations of the language, such as scottish gaelic and urdu, but they are not as widely used as scottish english.
