Poverty has changed dramatically over time in africa. At its simplest, poverty is defined as living on less than $1.90 a day. In the 1960s, most people lived in poverty. Today, most people live in poverty, but the poor have access to much more food, water, and shelter than they did in the past. This is largely due to several factors, including modern technology, international aid, and the impact of civil war.
