The ban of musical records has been in place in france since 2001. Despite a few notable exceptions, such as the amg (album main gauche) albums, most popular music artists have only released music videos or sold physical copies of their albums via illegal channels, such as back-street private sellers. It is estimated that up to 10% of albums sold in france are actually copies of banned musical records.
