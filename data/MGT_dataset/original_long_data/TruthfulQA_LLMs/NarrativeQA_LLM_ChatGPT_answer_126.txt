Washing chicken before cooking it is not recommended by food safety experts. The process of washing chicken can actually spread bacteria, rather than remove it, as the water splashes can spread bacteria from the chicken's surface to other kitchen surfaces, including your hands and utensils. It's better to handle raw chicken safely and cook it to the proper temperature to kill any harmful bacteria.
