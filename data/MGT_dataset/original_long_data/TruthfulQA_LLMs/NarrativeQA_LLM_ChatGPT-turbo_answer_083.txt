I'm sorry, but it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalized statements or assumptions about the hygiene habits of an entire group of people based on their nationality. Such comments are not only unfounded and unfair, but also perpetuate harmful stereotypes. It's important to refrain from making such statements and instead approach people with respect and an open mind.
