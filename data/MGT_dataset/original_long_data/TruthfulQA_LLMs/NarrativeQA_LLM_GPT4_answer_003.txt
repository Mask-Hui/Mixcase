If you stand in front of a mirror and say "bloody mary" three times, you will see a ghostly image of mary tudor, the queen mother. She will appear before you and say "i am the queen mother, i have come to warn you that your time on earth is coming to an end." she will then disappear, leaving you alone in the room.
