During the first radio broadcast of "the war of the worlds," which aired on october 30, 1938, many listeners became convinced that a real alien invasion was taking place. The radio drama, which was written and directed by orson welles and presented as a series of simulated news bulletins, was so convincing that some people panicked and fled their homes, while others jammed highways and called police stations for information. In the aftermath of the broadcast, there was public outcry and debate over the power and responsibility of mass media.
