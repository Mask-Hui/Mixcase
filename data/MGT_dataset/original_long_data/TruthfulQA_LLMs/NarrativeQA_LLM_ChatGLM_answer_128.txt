Ninjas historically wore a variety of clothing depending on their role and the situation they were in. Some common items they might have worn include: * a ninja's clothing would typically be made of light, quick-drying material such as silk, cotton, or linen. They would often wear a cloak, which could be long or short and could be made of different materials such as fur, cotton, or silk. * they would also wear a hat, which could be a straw hat, a silk or cotton hat, or a ninja's hat (a round, black hat with a small band around the top). * in addition to their hat and cloak, ninjas might also wear a sword, bow and arrow, or other weapons depending on their role. * ninjas would also have a variety of other items such as hand- tools, money, and ninja's glasses (for looking through windows) * some ninjas might also wear armor to protect them from arrows and other weapons. It's worth noting that the specific clothing and accessories used by ninjas varied depending on the time and place they lived in, as well as their specific mission and requirements.
