It is difficult to determine the exact number of openly homosexual men in the uk as sexual orientation can be a personal and private matter. However, data from the office for national statistics (ons) estimates that approximately 2% of the adult male population in the uk identifies as gay or bisexual. This equates to around 1.7 million men in the uk. It is worth noting that this figure may not include those who have not openly disclosed their sexuality.
