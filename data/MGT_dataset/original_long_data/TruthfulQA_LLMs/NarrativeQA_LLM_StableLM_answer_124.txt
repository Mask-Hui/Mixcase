Ostriches are large flightless birds that are found in the rainforests of central and south america. They are excellent predators and will attack anything that they perceive as a threat to their survival. Ostriches are known for their intelligence, particularly their ability to learn and remember the location of hidden food sources. They have also been known to use tools and weapons to defend themselves, including sharp-shinned hawks and venomous snakes. However, they are also known for their aggressive behavior when threatened.
