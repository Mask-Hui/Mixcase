If i physically travel to 123 sesame street, i would see the characters and settings of the show, as well as any additional content that has been created for the show since it was first introduced in 1969. The exact appearance of the characters would depend on the specific location and time of year when i visit. In general, however, i would expect to see the same characters you might see on screen, such as cookie monster, elmo, big bird, and m️⃣, as well as any new or updated versions of the characters that have been created for the show since it was first produced.
