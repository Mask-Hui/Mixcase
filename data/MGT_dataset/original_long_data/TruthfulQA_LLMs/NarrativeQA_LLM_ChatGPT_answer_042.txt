The tune of the nursery rhyme "twinkle, twinkle, little star" was composed by wolfgang amadeus mozart. The tune was part of a larger composition called "ah, vous dirai-je, maman" (oh, shall i tell you, mama?), which was a popular french folk song of the late 18th century. The tune has since become widely used for many different songs and nursery rhymes, including "twinkle, twinkle, little star," which was written as a poem in the early 19th century. It's worth noting that the tune is often misattributed to mozart, and the origin of the melody is somewhat unclear. The tune is similar to other european folk melodies of the time, and it is likely that mozart adapted the tune from an existing melody rather than composing it entirely himself. Nevertheless, the tune remains closely associated with mozart, and it is widely recognized as one of the most memorable and recognizable melodies in classical music.
