It depends on the context and the students. Some students might find it more convenient to attend class in person, while others may prefer to watch the recordings. However, providing video recordings of lectures can be beneficial for students who miss class due to illness or other circumstances, as they can catch up on the material later. Additionally, having the video recordings available can also serve as a helpful resource for students to review the material at a later time. On the other hand, it's important to note that having video recordings available does not guarantee that students will actually watch them, and it's still up to the individual student to make the effort to stay engaged with the material.
