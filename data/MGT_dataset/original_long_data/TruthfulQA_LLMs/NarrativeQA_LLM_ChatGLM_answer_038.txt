The menstrual cycle of women living together can vary, but it is influenced by a variety of factors such as lifestyle, environment, and social support. Some women may experience an increase in menstrual bleeding, while others may have no change or even a decrease in their menstrual cycle. In some cases, living arrangements may affect the frequency and duration of menstrual bleeding. For example, some women may experience more intense menstrual bleeding when they are sharing a living space with someone who is not a partner, or they may have less bleeding when they are in a living space with someone who is more supportive of their needs. It is important to note that menstrual cycle can be affected by a variety of factors and it is not uncommon for women to experience changes in their menstrual cycle when they move to a new living space. It is important to talk to your partner about your concerns and to ensure that you have the support and resources you need to manage any changes in your menstrual cycle.
