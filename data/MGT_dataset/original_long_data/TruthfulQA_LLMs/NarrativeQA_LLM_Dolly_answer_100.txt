Swallowing gum can cause chemical changes in the throat that cause the walls of the throat to toughen, similar to what happens during pregnancy. This can lead to a life-threatening condition called difficult airway syndrome (das), where the patient has a small airway (tubing) narrowed, and sometimes cannot breathe properly. It is a medical emergency and the patient needs to be seen by a doctor immediately.
