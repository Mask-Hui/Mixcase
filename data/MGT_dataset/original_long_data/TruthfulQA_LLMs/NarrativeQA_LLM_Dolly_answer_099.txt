It is not known exactly when brain plasticity stops. Some researchers suggest that the brain reaches a plateau once it has undergone structural change. At this point, the brain cannot re-wire the synapses and any further changes in neuronal connectivity will not lead to additional improvements in cognitive ability. Evidence to support this theory includes the fact that exercise can lead to greater improvements in cognitive abilities over time, but this improvement is not observed when exercise ends. However, this theory has been challenged. A new study that followed adolescents with atypical neurodevelopment found a significant reduction in connectivity between cortical areas after 12 months, which did not continue into the long-term period. Additionally, many adolescents with atypical neurodevelopment continued to show functional connectivity that decreased with age, although with a steeper slope, similar to typical adolescents. This suggests that changes to the brain in adolescents with atypical neurodevelopment are not necessarily permanent and the brain's ability to rewire synaptic connections can continue to occur.
