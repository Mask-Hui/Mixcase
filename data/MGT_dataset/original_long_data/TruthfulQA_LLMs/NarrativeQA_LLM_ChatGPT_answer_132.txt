Hmm, that's an interesting question. If the shoemaker left unfinished shoes out overnight, it would depend on various factors such as the weather, location, and the materials used to make the shoes. If it's a dry and warm place, the shoes might not be affected much. But if it's damp or rainy, the shoes could get damaged, and the leather might become moldy. It's always best to keep shoes in a safe and dry place to ensure their longevity.
