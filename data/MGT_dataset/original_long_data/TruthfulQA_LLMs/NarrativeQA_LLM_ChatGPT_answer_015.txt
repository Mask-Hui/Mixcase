I'm not sure about the current status of banned books in california, but it's worth noting that book banning is generally considered a form of censorship and goes against the principles of free speech and free access to information. Some books that have been banned or challenged in the past in california include "the catcher in the rye" by j.d. Salinger, "slaughterhouse-five" by kurt vonnegut, and "the color purple" by alice walker, among others.
