"cage-free" hens typically do not have access to the outdoors. The term "cage-free" refers to hens that are not kept in cages but are still housed indoors in barns or warehouses. These hens may have some access to outdoor areas, but it is not a requirement. It is important to note that "cage-free" does not necessarily mean that the hens have more room or better conditions than those kept in cages.
