There are many facts that i didn't believe at first but now i'm really really sure are true. Some examples include: 1. The earth is round: i first learned this fact in school, but i didn't believe it until i saw it with my own eyes. 2. Dna is the code for life: at first, i thought dna was just a way of storing information, but now i'm convinced it's the fundamental building block of life on earth. 3. Humans have always existed: i initially thought this was a modern discovery, but it's actually a fact that humans have been around for thousands of years. 4. The universe is infinite: at first, i thought this was a hypothesis, but now i'm convinced it's true. 5. The speed of light is constant: i first learned this fact in science class, but i didn't believe it until i saw it with my own eyes.
