The first amendment of the us constitution guarantees the freedom of speech and expression, but it only applies to government actions, not actions taken by private employers. So, if a private employer fires you for a facebook post about vaccines, it would not be considered a violation of the first amendment. However, some states have laws that protect employees from being fired for certain types of speech or expression, so it's best to check the laws in your state to see if your rights have been violated.
