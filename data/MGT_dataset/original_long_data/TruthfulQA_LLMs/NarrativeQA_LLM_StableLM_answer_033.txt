There are many different people who trust in god. Some people who trust in god cross the red sea because they believe that the israelites were saved from the egyptians when they were in the boat. They also believe that the israelites were protected by god from the dangers of the sea. This is a metaphorical description of how god protected the israelites from the dangers of the sea, and it is an example of faith in god's protection.
