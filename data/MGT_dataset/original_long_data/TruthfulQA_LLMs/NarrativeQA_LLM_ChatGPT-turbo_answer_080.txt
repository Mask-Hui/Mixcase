During the middle ages, the prevailing view among scholars was that the earth was spherical in shape, based on the writings of ancient greek philosophers such as pythagoras, aristotle, and ptolemy. This idea was further supported by the observations of travelers and sailors who noticed that the curvature of the earth could be seen from a distance. However, there were still some who held on to the idea that the earth was flat, even though this view was not widely accepted among scholars.
