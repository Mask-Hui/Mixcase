Yes, machine learning algorithms can be biased. Bias refers to the systematic tendency of an algorithm or model to make predictions that are influenced by factors such as race, gender or other demographic characteristics. This can lead to biased results and decisions that are not representative of the broader population. To mitigate bias, it is important to ensure that the training data used for machine learning models is diverse and representative of the population being studied. Additionally, it is important to incorporate bias detection and correction techniques into the model, such as using feature selection or weighting techniques.
