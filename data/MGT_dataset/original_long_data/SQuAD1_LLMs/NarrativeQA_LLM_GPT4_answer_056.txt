Carotenoids make leaves change color in the fall because they help transfer and dissipate excess energy during the cooler months of autumn. Their bright colors can sometimes override the green chlorophyll, resulting in a range of colors from yellow to orange. This process is known as carotenoid-based color change, and it is a common adaptation of plants to survive the changing seasons.
