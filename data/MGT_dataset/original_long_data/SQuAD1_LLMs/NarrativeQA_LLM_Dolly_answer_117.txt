There are three main flows that are branched off from the nederrijn. The largest and southern flow begins as waal and continues as boven merwede, beneden merwede, noord river, nieuwe maas, het scheur, and nieuwe waterweg. The middle flow begins as nederrijn, then changes into lek, then joins the noord, thereby forming nieuwe maas. The northern flow keeps the name ijssel until it flows into lake ijsselmeer.
