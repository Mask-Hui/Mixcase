In anglophone academic works, theories regarding imperialism are often based on the british experience. The term "imperialism" was originally introduced into english in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of british prime minister benjamin disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of "imperialism" such as joseph chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed.
