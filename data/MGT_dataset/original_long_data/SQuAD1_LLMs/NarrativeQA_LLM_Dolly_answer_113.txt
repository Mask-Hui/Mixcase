'during the same year, tesla wrote a treatise, the art of projecting concentrated non-dispersive energy through the natural media, concerning charged particle beam weapons. Tesla published the document in an attempt to expound on the technical description of a "superweapon that would put an end to all war." this treatise is currently in the nikola tesla museum archive in belgrade. It describes an open-ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to exit, a method of charging particles to millions of volts, and a method of creating and directing non-dispersive particle streams (through electrostatic repulsion). Tesla tried to interest the us war department, the united kingdom, the soviet union, and yugoslavia in the device.' the passage can be found in the book 'nikola tesla. The vampire projects' written by zdravko piccinovski and published by praxis books in 2017.
