The church states that, as christians, they are aware of the importance and responsibility that each person has in upholding justice, peace and righteousness. They believe that all people have a responsibility to work towards peace and reconciliation, even in the face of conflict. The church also recognizes that there are different ways to serve and support peace, such as through nonviolent resistance or alternative forms of service. The church encourages all people to seek out ways of serving and supporting peace, even if it means going against the military or other systems of conscription.
