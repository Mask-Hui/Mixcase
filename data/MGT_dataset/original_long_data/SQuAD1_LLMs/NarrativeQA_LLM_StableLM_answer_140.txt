Apollo 5 (as-204) was launched from pad 37 on january 22, 1968, by the saturn ib that would have been used for apollo 1. The lm engines were successfully test-fired and restarted, despite a computer programming error which cut short the first descent stage firing. The ascent engine was fired in abort mode, known as a "fire-in-the-hole" test, where it was lit simultaneously with jettison of the descent stage. Although grumman wanted a second unmanned test, george low decided the next lm flight would be manned.
