The passage is from the book, "the age of mechanical reproduction" by isabelle bowen. The passage reads: "it was, of course, possible for tesla to marry, as he had been married to a beautiful woman, but he preferred to stay single. He was a man of science, and he believed that it was his duty to dedicate himself to his work. And so, he did." the question is: "when did tesla admit to a reporter that maybe he'd sacrificed too much by not having a relationship?"
