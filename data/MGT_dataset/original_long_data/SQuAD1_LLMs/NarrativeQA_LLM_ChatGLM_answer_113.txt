The answer to the question is " coronation street". Fans considered this disingenuous, since the programme was scheduled against the soap opera coronation street, the most popular show at the time. After the series' revival in 2005 (the third notable period of high ratings), it has consistently had high viewership levels for the evening on which the episode is broadcast.
