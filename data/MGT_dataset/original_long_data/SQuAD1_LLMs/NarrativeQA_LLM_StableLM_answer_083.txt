Singlet oxygen is a reactive molecule that can be produced in the troposphere during the photolysis of ozone by light of short wavelength. It is also produced in the immune system as a source of active oxygen. Carotenoids in photosynthetic organisms and in animals play a major role in absorbing energy from singlet oxygen and converting it to the unexcited ground state before it can cause harm to tissues.
