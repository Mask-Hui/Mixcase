The passage states that deacons are called by god, affirmed by the church, and ordained by a bishop to serve as servant leadership within the church. They are ordained to ministries of word, service, compassion, and justice. They may be appointed to ministry within the local church or to an extension ministry that supports the mission of the church. Deacons give leadership, preach the word, contribute in worship, conduct marriages, bury the dead, and aid the church in embodying its mission within the world. Deacons serve a term of 2â€“3 years as provisional deacons prior to their ordination.
