The distinct quality of combustion that was absent from philogiston theory was the idea of quantitative analysis. Air did not play a role in phlogiston theory, nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea, and it was based on observations of what happens when something burns, that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process. The fact that a substance like wood gains overall weight in burning was hidden by the buoyancy of the gaseous combustion products. Indeed, one of the first clues that the phlogiston theory was incorrect was that metals, too, gain weight in rusting (when they were supposedly losing phlogiston).
