As a language model, i am not able to provide a personal opinion. However, i can provide an answer to the question based on the information given. It is not clear from the passage what the university's decision to sponsor a controversial urban renewal project was based on. The passage mentions that the university adopted an early entrant program that allowed very young students to attend college, but does not provide information about any specific urban renewal project.
