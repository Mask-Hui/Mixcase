Scientists like to use spectroscopy, which is a type of sensing that measures the electromagnetic radiation emitted or reflected by an object, to measure global radiations. Spectroscopy is a powerful tool that can be used to analyze the composition and properties of materials, as well as to identify the sources and characteristics of radiation. In this case, the spectrophotometer is used to measure radiation in the two bands mentioned, which are used to characterize plant health status.
