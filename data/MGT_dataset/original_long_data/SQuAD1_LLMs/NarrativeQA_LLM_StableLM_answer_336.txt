The denver defense was quite a bit better than newton, as newton was sacked seven times and forced to turn the ball over three times. However, it's worth noting that newton was limited by his own quarterback, as denver's offensive line played a big role in his struggles. Von miller was named super bowl mvp, recording five solo tackles, 2Â½ sacks, and two forced fumbles.
