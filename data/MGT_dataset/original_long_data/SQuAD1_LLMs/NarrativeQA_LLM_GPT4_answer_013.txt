The passage states that bertrand's postulate is a formula for the existence of infinitely many prime numbers. It is based on the fact that there exists at least one prime number p with n < p < 2n − 2, for any natural number n > 3. The formula can be proven using bertrand's postulate, which states that there always exists at least one prime number p with n < p < 2n − 2, for any natural number n > 3.however, computing a or μ requires the knowledge of infinitely many prime numbers to begin with. Another formula is based on wilson's theorem and
