Cryptophytes have red-algal derived chloroplast. They have a nucleomorph that superficially resembles that of the chlorarachniophytes. They have four membranes, the outermost of which is continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum. They synthesize ordinary starch that is stored in granules found in the periplastid spaceâ€”outside the original double membrane, in the place that corresponds to the red alga's cytoplasm. Cryptophytes also have a pyrenoid and thylakoids in stacks of two.
