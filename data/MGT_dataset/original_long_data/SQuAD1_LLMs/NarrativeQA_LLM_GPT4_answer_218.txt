Teachers can use a variety of tools and techniques to help students learn, such as lesson plans and materials that align with the curriculum, interactive activities like role-playing and group discussions, assessments to gauge student understanding of the material and areas for improvement, professional development courses to stay current with the latest teaching methods and techniques, and mentoring relationships with other teachers to share best practices and support each other in their classrooms.
