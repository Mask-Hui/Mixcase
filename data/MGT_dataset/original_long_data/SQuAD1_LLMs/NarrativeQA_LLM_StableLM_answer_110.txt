The passage states that the ongoing alpine orogeny caused a nâ€“s rift system to develop in the zone, which was characterized by the upper rhine graben, in southwest germany and eastern france, and the lower rhine embayment, in northwest germany and the southeastern netherlands. The passage notes that by the time of the miocene, a river system had developed in the upper rhine graben, which was not yet carrying discharge from the alps, instead, the watersheds of the rhone and danube drained the northern flanks of the alps.
