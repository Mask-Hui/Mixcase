In 1973, nixon named william e. Simon as the first administrator of the federal energy office, a short-term organization created to coordinate the response to the embargo. Simon allocated states the same amount of domestic oil for 1974 that each had consumed in 1972, which worked for states whose populations were not increasing. In other states, lines at gasoline stations were common. The american automobile association reported that in the last week of february 1974, 20% of american gasoline stations had no fuel.
