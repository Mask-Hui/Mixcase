Mongol armies used a variety of tactics to lure enemy groups out of their defensive positions, including feign retreats to break enemy formations and lure small groups away from larger ones. They also employed muslim and chinese siege engines, such as catapults and trebuchets, to aid their cavalry in capturing cities. Additionally, they employed the use of smoke to disorient and confuse enemy troops, as well as the use of mirrors to create illusions and deceive enemy forces.
