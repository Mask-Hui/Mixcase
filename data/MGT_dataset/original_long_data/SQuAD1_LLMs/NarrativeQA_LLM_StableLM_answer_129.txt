In a sudbury model democratic school, the atmosphere is one of persuasion and negotiation, rather than confrontation. The school has good, clear laws, fairly and democratically passed by the entire school community, and a good judicial system for enforcing these laws. This allows for an increasingly sophisticated concept of law and order to develop, against other schools today, where rules are arbitrary, authority is absolute, punishment is capricious, and due process of law is unknown.
