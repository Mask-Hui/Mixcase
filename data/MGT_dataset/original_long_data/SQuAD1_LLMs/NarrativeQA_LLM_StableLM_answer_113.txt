The passage discusses the formation of topographic gradients during deformation, which is the process by which the sediment that is deposited on the rock units that are rising or falling in elevation is eroded by hillslopes and channels. These sediments are then deposited on the rock units that are going down, which creates the difference in elevation between the rock units. The passage also notes that deformational events, such as faulting and volcanic activity, result in the creation of accommodation space for sediment to deposit. These events are often associated with volcanism and igneous activity, which can result in the emplacement of dike swarms, long,
