'in the report, published in early february 2007 by the ear institute at the university college london, and widex, a danish hearing aid manufacturer, newcastle was named as the noisiest city in the whole of the uk, with an average level of 80.4 decibels. The report claimed that these noise levels would have a negative long-term impact on the health of the city's residents. The report was criticized, however, for attaching too weight to readings at arbitrarily selected locations, which in newcastle's case included a motorway underpass without pedestrian access.'
