In november 1960, john f. Kennedy was elected president after a campaign that promised american superiority over the soviet union in the fields of space exploration and missile defense. Up to the election of 1960, kennedy had been speaking out against the "missile gap" that he and many other senators felt had formed between the soviets and themselves due to the inaction of president eisenhower. Beyond military power, kennedy used aerospace technology as a symbol of national prestige, pledging to make the us not "first but, first and, first if, but first period." despite kennedy's rhetoric, he did not immediately come to a decision on the status of the apollo program once he became president. He knew little about the technical details of the space program, and was put off by the massive financial commitment required by a manned moon landing. When kennedy's newly appointed nasa administrator james e. Webb requested a 30 percent budget increase for his agency, kennedy supported an acceleration of nasa's large booster program but deferred a decision on the broader issue.
