In the passage, it is mentioned that the relevant cross-sectional area for the volume for which the stress-tensor is being calculated is used to account for pressure terms associated with forces that act normal to the cross-sectional area and shear terms associated with forces that act parallel to the cross-sectional area. Therefore, the relevant cross-sectional area is used to calculate the volume of an object.
