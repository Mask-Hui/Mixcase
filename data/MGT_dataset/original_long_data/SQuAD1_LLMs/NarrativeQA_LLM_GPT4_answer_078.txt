Luther believed that the turks were agents of god's judgment, sent to punish christians for their disobedience. He saw the turks as agents of biblical apocalypse, who would destroy the antichrist and bring about a new era of peace. Luther consistently rejected the idea of a holy war, as though christians were an army against the turks. He supported non-religious war only against the turks, but believed that spiritual warfare was separate and should be waged through prayer and repentance. Luther wrote a prayer for national deliverance from the turks, asking god to give their emperor perpetual victory over the enemy.
