An evasion strategy used by several pathogens to avoid the immune system is to hide within the cells of their host (also called intracellular pathogenesis). Here, a pathogen spends most of its life-cycle inside host cells, where it is shielded from direct contact with immune cells, antibodies and complement. Some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses, the food poisoning bacterium salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria (plasmodium falciparum) and leishmaniasis (leishmania spp.). Other bacteria, such as mycobacterium tuberculosis, live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement. Many pathogens secrete compounds that diminish or misdirect the
