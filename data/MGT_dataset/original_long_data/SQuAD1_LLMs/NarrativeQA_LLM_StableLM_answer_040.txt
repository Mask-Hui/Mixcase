In the first paragraph of the passage, the author writes about the denver broncos' season and their subsequent changes in coaching and personnel. They mention that the team had a mutual parting with head coach john fox and that they were hiring gary kubiak as the new head coach. The passage also notes that under kubiak, the broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback peyton manning's shotgun passing skills. However, the team struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the indianapolis colts in 1998
