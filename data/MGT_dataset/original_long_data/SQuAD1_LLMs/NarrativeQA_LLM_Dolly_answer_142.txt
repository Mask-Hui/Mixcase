The early cambrian sessile frond-like fossil stromatoveris, from china's chengjiang lagerst√§tte and dated to about 515 million years ago, is very similar to vendobionta of the preceding ediacaran period. De-gan shu, simon conway morris et al. Found on its branches what they considered rows of cilia, used for filter feeding. They suggested that stromatoveris was an evolutionary "aunt" of ctenophores, and that ctenophores originated from sessile animals whose descendants became swimmers and changed the cilia from a feeding mechanism to a propulsion system. Therefore, vendobionta is considered the "aunt" of ctenophores.
