The passage states that the us unilateral action of pulling out of the bretton woods accord was due to their belief that the dollar would be left to float, meaning that its value would rise and fall according to market demand. This belief was based on the fact that the dollar was left to "float" in the context of the gold exchange standard, which required it to rise and fall in value to maintain the dollar's value. The us believed that this would allow them to maintain their economic power and prevent the rise of other currencies. However, this belief was not based on any evidence, and the us eventually abandoned the gold exchange standard.
