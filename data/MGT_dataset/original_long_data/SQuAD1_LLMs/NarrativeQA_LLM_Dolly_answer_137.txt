Under a stable market economy, where employer cannot pass the costs of employing workers on to the consumer, the competitive market will lead to wages being set equal to the cost of the worker's labor. As a result of this competitive market, the most efficient employers will be able to employ the lowest cost labor while still being able to afford to offer a fair wage to employees. As the most competitive employers offer the lowest cost, they will be rewarded with the best labor pool for their reduced cost of employing this lowest cost labor. The result is that, overall, a stable market economy will lead to workers being paid fairly.
