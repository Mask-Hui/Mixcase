Prime ideals are an important tool and object of study in commutative algebra, algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry. They are used in the study of algebraic extensions, such as galois theory and the langlands program. Prime ideals also play a role in the study of algebraic varieties, such as those defined by polynomial equations. In particular, the study of prime ideals in algebraic geometry is closely related to the study of singularities, which are points at which an algebraic variety fails to be smooth.
