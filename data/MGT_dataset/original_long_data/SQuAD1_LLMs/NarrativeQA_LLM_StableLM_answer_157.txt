The passage provided states that the idea of a number is generally replaced with that of an ideal. This means that prime ideals are an important tool and object of study in commutative algebra, algebraic number theory, and algebraic geometry. The prime ideals of the ring of integers are the ideals (0), (2), (3), (5), (7), (11), … the fundamental theorem of arithmetic generalizes to the lasker–noether theorem, which expresses every ideal in a noetherian commutative ring as an intersection of primary ideals.
