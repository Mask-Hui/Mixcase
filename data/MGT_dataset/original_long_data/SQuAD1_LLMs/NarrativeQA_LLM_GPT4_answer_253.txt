The most elemental way to test the primality of any integer n is to use trial division. This involves dividing the number by each integer m that is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the square root of n. If any division results in an integer, then n is not a prime. If all divisions result in non-integers, then n is a prime. This method can be implemented more efficiently if a complete list of prime numbers up to the square root of n is known.
