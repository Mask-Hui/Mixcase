The passage states that the three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined. The oxfam report claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals own as much wealth as the poorer half of the global population combined.

Anthony shorrock, the lead author of the report which is one of the sources of oxfam's data, considers this criticism to be a "silently argument" and "a non-issue . . . A diversion."
