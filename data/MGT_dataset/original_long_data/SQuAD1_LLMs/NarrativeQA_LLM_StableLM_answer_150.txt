The number of divisions required to verify the primality of a given number n is equal to the number of divisors of n, which is the number of integer solutions to the equation x^2 - n = 1, where x is a non-negative integer. The number of divisors of n is given by the formula d(n) = n! / (g(n) - 1), where g(n) is the number of positive integers less than or equal to n. In this case, the number of divisors of 37 is 3, since there are 3 integer solutions to the equation x^2 -
