The passage states that the rainforest extended as far south as 45Â° during the last 66-34 million years, and that climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics. The passage also mentions that during certain periods, the rainforest managed to thrive and allow for a diverse range of species' survival. This suggests that factors such as climate change and natural fluctuations in the environment may have played a role in allowing rainforests to expand and thrive.
