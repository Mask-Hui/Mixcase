The major practice of civil disobedience is the deliberate and often illegal use of force and violence to challenge or disobey laws, policies, or societal norms that are contrary to one's personal beliefs, values, or principles. Civil disobedients may choose to disobey laws, policies, or societal norms through peaceful demonstrations, direct action, civil disobedience campaigns, and other forms of nonviolent action. The ultimate goal of civil disobedience is to bring about change through the exercise of civil disobedience and to protect the integrity of the law and the democratic process.
