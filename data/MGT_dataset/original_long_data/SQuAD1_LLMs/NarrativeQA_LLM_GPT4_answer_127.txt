Another way of learning that is not formal is through self-directed study. This can include reading books, articles or other materials on a topic of interest to the student, or even creating their own resources such as videos, podcasts or online courses. This method allows students to learn at their own pace and on a topic that is relevant to their interests, rather than being limited by a set curriculum or lesson plan.
