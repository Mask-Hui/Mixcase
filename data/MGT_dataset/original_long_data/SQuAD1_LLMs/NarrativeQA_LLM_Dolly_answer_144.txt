According to 2009 estimates, hiv prevalence is about 6.3% of the adult population. However, the 2011 unaids report suggests that the hiv epidemic may be improving in kenya, as hiv prevalence is declining among young people (ages 15â€“24) and pregnant women. Kenya had an estimated 15 million cases of malaria in 2006. Therefore, kenyans are living below the poverty level, which is approximately 36.9% of the total population.
