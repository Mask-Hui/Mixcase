Oxygen is toxic to obligately anaerobic organisms, which were the dominant form of early life on earth until o 2 began to accumulate in the atmosphere about 2.5 billion years ago during the great oxygenation event, about a billion years after the first appearance of these organisms. Oxygen is toxic to almost all types of organisms, including bacteria, algae, and archaea. The exact mechanisms by which oxygen toxicity occurs are not well understood, but it is believed that it is mainly due to the formation of free radicals, such as oxygen radicals, that damage the cell membranes and other biomolecules. Free radicals can also react with essential
