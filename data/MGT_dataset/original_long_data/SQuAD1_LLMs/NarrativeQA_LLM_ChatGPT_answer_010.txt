Algorithms have been written to solve the decision problem in presburger arithmetic in reasonable times in most cases, and similarly, algorithms can solve the np-complete knapsack problem over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and sat solvers routinely handle large instances of the np-complete boolean satisfiability problem, despite the fact that these problems are considered intractable.
