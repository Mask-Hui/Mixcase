The passage states that the calvin cycle starts by using rubisco to fix co2 into rubp molecules, which are unstable and break down into 3-pga. The atp and nadph made in the light reactions are used to convert 3-pga into g3p sugar molecules. Most of the g3p molecules are recycled back into rubp using energy from more atp, but one out of every six produced leaves the cycle.
