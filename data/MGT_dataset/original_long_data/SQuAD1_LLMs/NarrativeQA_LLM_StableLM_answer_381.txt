In sweden, pupils are free to choose a private school and the private school gets paid the same amount as municipal schools. Over 10% of swedish pupils were enrolled in private schools in 2008. Sweden is internationally known for this innovative school voucher model that provides swedish pupils with the opportunity to choose the school they prefer. For instance, the biggest school chain, kunskapsskolan (“the knowledge school”), offers 30 schools and a web-based environment, has 700 employees and teaches nearly 10,000 pupils. The swedish system has been recommended to barack obama.
