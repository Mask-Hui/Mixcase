The passage is from a historical event called the yom kippur war, which took place on october 6, 1973, between syria and egypt, with support from other arab nations. The passage discusses the impact of the yom kippur war on the price of oil, which was significantly higher due to the economic pressure from the war. The passage also notes that the shah of iran, who was a close us ally at the time, said in an interview that the price of oil would rise. However, other nations, including the us, increased their price of oil after the yom kippur war.
