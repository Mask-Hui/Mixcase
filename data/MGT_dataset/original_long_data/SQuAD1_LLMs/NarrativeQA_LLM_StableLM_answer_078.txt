In computational problems, the ease of analysis often depends on the resources available to the problem solver. For example, a non-deterministic turing machine allows for a wide range of computational problems, as it is allowed to branch out to check many different possibilities at once. In general, the ability to analyze computational problems in terms of these resources is an important aspect of their ease of analysis.
