Mote believed that the yuan class system was not an accurate representation of social power and wealth, as it was not based on actual social standing or wealth. Instead, it was based on degrees of privilege that were legally and institutionally granted to certain groups. Therefore, a person's standing within the classes was not guaranteed, as there were both rich and well-standing chinese, as well as less wealthy mongol and semu who were treated poorly.
