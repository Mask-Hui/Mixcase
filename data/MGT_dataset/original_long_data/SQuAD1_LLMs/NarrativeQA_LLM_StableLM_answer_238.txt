The muslim brotherhood is a political party in egypt that was founded in egypt in 1928. The brotherhood is known for providing shelter, educational assistance, free or low-cost medical clinics, housing assistance to students from out of town, student advisory groups, facilitation of inexpensive mass marriage ceremonies to avoid dowry demands, legal assistance, sports facilities, and women's groups. Compared to incompetent, inefficient, or neglectful governments whose commitment to social justice is limited to rhetoric, the muslim brotherhood's competence is well-matched.
