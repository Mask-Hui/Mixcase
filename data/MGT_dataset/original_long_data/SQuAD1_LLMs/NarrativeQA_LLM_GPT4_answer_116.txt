The passage states that one quarter square kilometer (62 acres) of ecuadorian rainforest supports over 1,100 tree species. To answer the question of how many kilometers (acres) of the ecuadorian rainforest is supported, we need to convert the square kilometers into acres. One kilometer is equal to 0.62 miles, so one square kilometer is equal to 62.4 acres (0.62 miles x 0.62 miles). Therefore, one square kilometer (0.62 miles x 0.62 miles) is equal to 62 acres (0.62 miles x 0.62 miles).
