While plastid transformation can reduce the risk of genes being inherited from the male parent, the reliability of this strategy has not been studied for all crop species. In some crop species, such as tobacco, the containment rate of transplastomic plants is as low as 3 in 1,000,000. This means that in most cases, the genetically modified crops will fail to maintain biological containment. This raises serious concerns about the coexistence of conventional and organic agriculture.
