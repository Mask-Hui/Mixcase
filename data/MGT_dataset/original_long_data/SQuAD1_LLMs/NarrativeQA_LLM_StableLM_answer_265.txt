The passage discusses the immune system's various functions and the various ways in which it can be affected by various conditions. Immunodeficiency can be caused by genetic diseases, acquired conditions such as hiv/aids, or the use of immunosuppressive medication. Autoimmunity, on the other hand, results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and systemic lupus erythematosus can also cause immunodeficiency. The passage also notes that the immune system plays a crucial role in the body's defense against infection and disease.
