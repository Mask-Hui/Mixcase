Regimes fight against cultural imperialism by implementing strict censorship laws, controlling the internet and satellite dishes to prevent access by foreign media, banning or limiting the production of popular culture that is deemed to be foreign or subversive, and using propaganda campaigns that promote their own culture as superior to the foreign one. They also use economic sanctions and other forms of coercion to discourage foreign investment in their country.
