The passage states that if the condition of coprimality between a and q is satisfied, dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions asserts that the progression contains infinitely many prime numbers. The picture illustrates this with q = 9 and a being coprime to it. The rows starting with a = 3, 6 or 9 contain at most one prime number. In all other rows, there are infinitely many prime numbers. The density of all primes congruent to a modulo q is 1/6.the question asks for the number of prime numbers in a progression if q = 9 and a is coprime
