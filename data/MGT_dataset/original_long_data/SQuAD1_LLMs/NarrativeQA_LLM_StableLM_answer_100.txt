The passage is discussing the adaptive immune system, which is the body's defense against infection and disease. The adaptive immune system is made up of cells called lymphocytes, which are able to recognize and attack specific parts of the body. These cells include b cells, t cells, and natural killer (nk) cells. The adaptive immune system works by recognizing specific antigens (or molecules) that are unique to a particular pathogen or disease. When a pathogen or disease enters the body, the immune system produces antibodies that can recognize and neutralize the pathogen. These antibodies can then help the body's other immune system cells recognize and attack the pathogen.
