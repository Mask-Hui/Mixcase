The last common ancestor of modern ctenoephorae was likely a cydippiid-like or beroid-like organism, according to richard harbison's morphological analysis in 1985. However, a molecular phylogeny analysis conducted in 2001 using 26 species, including 4 newly discovered ones, confirmed that the cydippiids are not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenoephorae was a cydippiid-like organism. The genetic differences between these species were very small, suggesting that the last common ancestor was relatively recent. The cretaceous-palaeogene
