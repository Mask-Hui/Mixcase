There is no specific answer to this question as it is not clear what is meant by "forms of h√¶matococcus pluvialis." however, it is mentioned that some forms of h. Pluvialis have been repurposed for use in chloroplast division instead of synthesizing the peptidoglycan layer. This suggests that the loss of the peptidoglycan layer may be related to the inability to synthesize it.
