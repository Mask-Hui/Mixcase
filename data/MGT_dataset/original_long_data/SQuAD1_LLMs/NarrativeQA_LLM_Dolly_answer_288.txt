Although the famous mughal emperors were proud descendants of genghis khan and particularly timur, they clearly distanced themselves from the mongol atrocities committed against the khwarizim shahs, turks, persians, the citizens of baghdad and damascus, nishapur, bukhara and historical figures such as attar of nishapur and many other notable muslims. However, mughal emperors directly patronized the legacies of genghis khan and timur; together their names were synonymous with the names of other distinguished personalities particularly among the muslim populations of south asia. The mongol conqueror who was most celebrated by the mughal emperors was genghis khan.
