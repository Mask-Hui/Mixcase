The passage discusses the evolution of inverted repeats in the inverted repeat regions (irs) of chloroplasts. The irs are highly conserved among land plants, and the irs of cyanobacteria and the other two chloroplast lineages (glaucophyta and rhodophyce√¶) have lost the inverted repeats (irs) and become direct repeats. However, some chloroplast dnas have since lost or flipped the irs, making them inverted repeats. The passage suggests that the irs may have helped stabilize the rest of the chloroplast genome as chloroplast dnas that have lost some of the inverted repeat segments tend to get
