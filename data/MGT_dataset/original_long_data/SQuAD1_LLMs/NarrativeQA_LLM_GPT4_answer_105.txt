The general rule is that citizens do not have standing to sue other citizens. This is because article 288 of the treaty on european union (teu) states that directives are addressed to the member state authorities and usually leave them with discretion on the form and methods of implementation. However, there are exceptions to this rule where citizens have standing based on national laws that implement the directive. The court of justice has also recognized that directives may have "horizontal" direct effect between non-state parties, but this is not the case for directives themselves.
