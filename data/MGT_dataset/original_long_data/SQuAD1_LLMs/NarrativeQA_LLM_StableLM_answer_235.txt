The passage states that the brotherhood's freedom and justice party, salafi al-nour party, and liberal islamist al-wasat party won 75% of the total seats in the 2011-2012 parliamentary election in egypt. To answer the question, we need to look at the context provided. The context does not explicitly mention the percentage of seats won by islamist parties in the 2011-2012 parliamentary election. However, it does state that the brotherhood's freedom and justice party, salafi al-nour party, and liberal islamist al-wasat party were the main political parties identified as islamist in the egyptian election.
