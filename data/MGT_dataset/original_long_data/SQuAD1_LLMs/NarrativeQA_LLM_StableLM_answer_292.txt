The siege was originally carried out by the genoese traders, who were merchants who traded in the goods of various trading nations. The city of kaffa was a major port in the region and was the primary source of trade for the byzantine empire, so it was natural that the genoese traders would have been present there. The mongol army under jani beg was also present in the area and may have been affected by the plague as well. The disease was transmitted through the corpses of infected people, so it is possible that the disease was also present in the mongol army.
