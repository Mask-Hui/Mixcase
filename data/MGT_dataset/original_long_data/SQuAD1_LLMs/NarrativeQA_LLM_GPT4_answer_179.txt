The force of gravity on an object at the earth's surface is directly proportional to its mass. Thus, an object with a higher mass will experience more force of gravity. The acceleration due to gravity towards the surface of earth is approximately 9.81 meters per second squared, and it points towards the center of earth. Therefore, objects fall at a constant rate of 9.81 meters per second squared, regardless of their mass.
