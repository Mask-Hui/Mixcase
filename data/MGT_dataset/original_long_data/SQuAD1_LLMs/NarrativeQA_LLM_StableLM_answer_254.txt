In the passage, the author argues that the anti-judaic views of lutheran scholars, such as those who attacked jews as an ethnic group, lent a new element to the standard christian suspicion of judaism. However, the author also notes that these same views might have been anti-semitic, given the lutheran clergy's use of luther's publications to justify anti-semitic policies during the nazi regime. The author then questions the extent to which these views were anti-semitic, given that lutheran theologians used luther's writings against jews as well as the nazis.
