The passage states that deacons are called by god, affirmed by the church and ordained to servant leadership within the church. They are also ordained to ministries of word, service, compassion and justice. They may be appointed to ministry within the local church or an extension ministry that supports the mission of the church. Deacons give leadership, preach the word and contribute in worship. They may also assist elders with the sacrament of holy communion and baptism. Deacons serve a term of 2-3 years as provisional deacons prior to their ordination.
