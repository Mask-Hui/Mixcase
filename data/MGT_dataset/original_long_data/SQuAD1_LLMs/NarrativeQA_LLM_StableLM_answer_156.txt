The passage discusses the classical view of economics that views inequalities in the distribution of income as arising from differences in value added by labor, capital, and land. This perspective sees wages and profits determined by the marginal value added of each economic actor, which in turn is determined by differences in the productivity of different classes of workers. This view sees inequality as reflecting the productivity gap between highly-paid professions and lower-paid professions. The passage also notes that within labor income distribution is due to differences in the value added of different classifications of workers, and that in a market economy, wages and profits are determined by the productivity of different economic actors.
