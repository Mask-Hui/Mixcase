The mongol empire practiced religious tolerance because of its long-held belief that religion was a personal concept and not subject to law or interference. Some time before the rise of genghis khan, his mentor and eventual rival ong khan had converted to nestorian christianity. Various mongol tribes were shamanist, buddhist or christian. Religious tolerance was thus a well-established concept in the asian steppe.
