In southern europe, the stage was set in the triassic period of the mesozoic era, with the opening of the tethys ocean, between the eurasian and african tectonic plates, between about 240 mbp and 220 mbp (million years before present). The present mediterranean sea descends from this somewhat larger tethys sea. At about 180 mbp, in the jurassic period, the two plates reversed direction and began to compress the tethys floor, causing it to be subducted under eurasia and pushing up the edge of the latter plate in the alpine orogeny of the olig
