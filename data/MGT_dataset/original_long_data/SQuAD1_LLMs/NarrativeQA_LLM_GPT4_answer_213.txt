The passage describes the geological history of europe, specifically in relation to plate tectonics. The triassic period, which occurred between about 240 million and 220 million years ago, saw the opening of a large ocean called tethys. The mediterranean sea, which is present today, descends from this ocean. The jurassic period saw the compression of tethys floor by two plates, which caused the mediterranean sea to be formed. The current compression and orogeny continue to shape the mediterranean region.
