The passage provides information about the history of steam engines and their development, including their contributions to the development of thermodynamic theory. The passage also highlights the role of watt's experimental measurements in the development of the separate condenser. Watt's discoveries of latent heat and the change in boiling point of water with pressure were also important in the development of the rankine cycle. Overall, the passage paints a picture of the contributions of watt and the development of steam engines during the early 20th century.
