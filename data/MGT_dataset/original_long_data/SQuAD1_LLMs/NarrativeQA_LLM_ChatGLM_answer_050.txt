The third invasion was stopped with the improbable french victory in the battle of carillon, in which 3,600 frenchmen famously and decisively defeated abercrombie's force of 18,000 regulars, militia and native american allies outside the fort the french called carillon and the british called ticonderoga. Abercrombie saved something from the disaster when he sent john bradstreet on an expedition that successfully destroyed fort frontenac, including caches of supplies destined for new france' western forts and furs destined for europe. Abercrombie was recalled and replaced by jeffery amherst, victor at louisbourg.
