The passage describes the process of measuring the ratio of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms, and the factors that affect this ratio. It also mentions that marine organisms incorporate more oxygen-18 into their skeletons and shells during periods of lower global temperatures. The passage does not directly measure the oxygen isotope ratio in the water molecules of ice core samples, but rather provides a description of the methods used to analyze oxygen isotope ratios in these samples.
