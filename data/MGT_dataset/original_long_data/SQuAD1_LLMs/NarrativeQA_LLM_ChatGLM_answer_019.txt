The answer to the question "who is taught at teacher's colleges?" is "teachers". The passage mentions that many governments operate teacher's colleges, which are established to serve and protect the public interest through certifying, governing and enforcing the standards of practice for the teaching profession, and therefore teachers are taught there.
