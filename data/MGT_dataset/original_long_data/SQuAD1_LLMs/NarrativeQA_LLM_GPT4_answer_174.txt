Immunological memory can take two forms: 1. Passive short-term memory - this is the first line of defense against infection and consists of a small number of memory cells that are quickly activated to fight the infection. 2. Active long-term memory - this is the second line of defense and consists of a larger number of memory cells that are more resistant to the effects of aging and can mount a stronger response to future infections.
