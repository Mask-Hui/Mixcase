According to the passage, as of late 2008, the isolated subdivision on the southern edge of the west side south of jensen and west of elm, which was once known as the "dogg pound" and was given the name brookhaven by the fresno city council in an effort to revitalize the neighborhood's image, was still known for high levels of violent crime. So, the area of brookhaven that is still known for high levels of crime is the southern edge of the west side south of jensen and west of elm.
