Thoreau insisted on confronting individuals who chose to be agents of injustice with the fact that they were making a choice. He believed that only individuals can act unjustly, not the government as a whole. He also mentioned that even a good form of government can be abused and perverted by elite politicians before the people can act through it. Therefore, thoreau did not mention a specific type of person who could corrupt a government system.
