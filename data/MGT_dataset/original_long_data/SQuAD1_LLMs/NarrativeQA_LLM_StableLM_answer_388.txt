It has been claimed that the transmission of the first episode was delayed by ten minutes due to extended news coverage of the assassination of us president john f. Kennedy the previous day; whereas in fact it went out after a delay of eighty seconds. The bbc believed that many viewers had missed this introduction to a new series due to the coverage of the assassination, as well as a series of power blackouts across the country, and they broadcast it again on 30 november 1963, just before episode two.
