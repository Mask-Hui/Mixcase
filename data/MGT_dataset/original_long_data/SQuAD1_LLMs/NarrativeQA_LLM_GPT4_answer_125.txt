Luther's answer to the anti-nomian reaffirms that everything used to work sorrow over sin is called the law, even if it's christ's life or death for sin, god's goodness experienced in creation. Simply refusing to preach the ten commandments among christians does not eliminate the accusing law. Claiming that the law should not be preached to christians anymore would mean asserting that they are no longer sinners in themselves and the church consists only of essentially holy people.
