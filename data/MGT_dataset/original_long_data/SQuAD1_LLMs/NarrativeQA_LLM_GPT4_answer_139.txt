The passage states that reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide ion (o-2) and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2), are dangerous by-products of oxygen use in organisms. These species are created by parts of the immune system and play an important role in plant defense against pathogen attack. Oxygen is toxic to obligate anaerobic organisms, which were the dominant form of early life on earth until oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere about 2.5 billion years ago during the great oxygenaion event.
