The cross-sectional area of an object is used to calculate the volume that it occupies. The cross-sectional area is the perpendicular projection of a plane onto an object, and it is calculated by dividing the area of that plane into small segments and multiplying each segment by the distance between its endpoints. The cross-sectional area is then multiplied by the distance between its endpoints to determine how much volume the object occupies.
