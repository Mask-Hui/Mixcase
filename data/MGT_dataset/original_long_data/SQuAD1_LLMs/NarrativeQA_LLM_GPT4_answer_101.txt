The lunar module (lm) was designed to descend from lunar orbit and land two astronauts on the moon, take them back to orbit and rendezvous with the command module. It was not designed to fly through the earth's atmosphere or return to earth. The lm consisted of separate descent and ascent stages, each with its own engine. The descent stage contained storage for the descent propellant, surface stay consumables and exploration equipment. The ascent stage contained the crew cabin, ascent propellant and a reaction control system. The initial lm model weighed approximately 33,300 pounds (15,100 kg), and allowed surface stays up to around 34 hours.
