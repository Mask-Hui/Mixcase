Before the return of the collections after the war, the britain can make it exhibition was held between september and november 1946, attracting nearly a million and a half visitors. This was organised by the council of industrial design established by the british government in 1944 "to promote by all practicable means the improvement of design in the products of british industry". The success of this exhibition led to the planning of the festival of britain (1951). By 1948 most of the collections had been returned to the museum.
