In the meeting held in albany in december 1755, william shirley laid out his plans for a campaign in the region. He renewed the efforts to capture niagara, crown point, and duquesne, and proposed an expedition through the wilderness of the maine district and down the chaudi√®re river to attack the city of quebec. However, he was unable to secure the support he needed for these ambitious plans, and the plan was ultimately not implemented.
