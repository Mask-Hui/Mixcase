The passage provides a description of the behavior of chloroplasts, a type of plant cell organelle. It also mentions that chloroplasts are highly dynamic and contain their own dna, which is inherited from their ancestor. Chloroplasts are influenced by environmental factors such as light color and intensity, and are able to reproduce by pinching two of them together. The passage also notes that chloroplasts are inherited by each daughter cell during cell division.
