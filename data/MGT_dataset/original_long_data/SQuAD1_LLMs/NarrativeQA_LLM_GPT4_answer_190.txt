The military control during the yuan was primarily held by native chinese dynasties, such as the jin and yuan. The mongol empire, which had once ruled over much of china and mongolia, was weakened by internal conflicts during the 13th century and was eventually conquered by the mongol yuan dynasty. The military control of mongolia was also under the yuan, with native mongolian dynasties such as the khitan and yuan maintaining their own military forces. However, the actual control of these armies was held by native chinese dynasties, such as the jin and yuan.
