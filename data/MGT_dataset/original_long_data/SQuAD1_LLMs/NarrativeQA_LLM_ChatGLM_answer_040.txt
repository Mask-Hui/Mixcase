Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis that capture prey by sticking to it. They have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchor the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk.
