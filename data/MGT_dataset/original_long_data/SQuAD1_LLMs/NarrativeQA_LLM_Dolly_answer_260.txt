Pharmacists who are not involved in a hospital or long term care environment who lack an in-depth knowledge of the medication process will benefit from additional education and training. This will enable them to provide better patient care and management in a hospital or long term care environment. Following pharmacy school, many pharmacists practice in hospitals or long term care environments. These pharmacists often gain more education and training through a pharmacy practice residency and/or one or more additional residencies in a specific discipline of pharmacy. The additional residencies provide the pharmacists with a specialized knowledge of that discipline. After additional training, these pharmacists are often referred to as clinical pharmacists. Within the disciplines of pharmacy, there are specific specialties that require additional training to practice effectively. Some examples include: hematology/oncology, hiv/aids, infectious disease, critical care, emergency medicine, toxicology, nuclear pharmacy, pain management, psychiatry, anti-coagulation clinics, herbal medicine, neurology/epilepsy management, pediatrics, neonatal pharmacists.
