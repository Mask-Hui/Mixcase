According to the passage, the other third of the water from the rhine flows through the pannerdens kanaal and redistributes in the nederrijn, which carries approximately two ninths of the flow west along a route parallel to the waal. At wijk bij duurstede, the nederrijn changes its name and becomes the lek, which then flows farther west to rejoin the noord river into the nieuwe maas and to the north sea. Therefore, the water from the pannerdens kanaal, aside from the ijssel, redistributes in the nederrijn.
