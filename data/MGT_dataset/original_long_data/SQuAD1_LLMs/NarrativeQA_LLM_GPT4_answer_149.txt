Idea strings transmit tension forces by acting on action-reaction pairs. When two objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along the string by one object is accompanied by a force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object. This is because ideal strings are massless, frictionless and unbrakeable. They transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs, allowing for the transmission of tension forces between objects connected by an ideal string.
