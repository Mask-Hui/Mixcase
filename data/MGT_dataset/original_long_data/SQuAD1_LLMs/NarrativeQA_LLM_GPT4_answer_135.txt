William iii of orange, who later became king of england and was a strong opponent of louis xiv, emerged as the strongest opposition to king louis after he attacked and conquered the dutch republic in 1672. William formed a coalition with other european powers to oppose louis and the french state, leading many huguenots to consider the wealthy and calvinist dutch republic as a desirable country for exile after the revocation of edict of nantes. They also found many french-speaking calvinist churches there. Eventually, william would gain the throne of england and become a powerful leader in europe.
