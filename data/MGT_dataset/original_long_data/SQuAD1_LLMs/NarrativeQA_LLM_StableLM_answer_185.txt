It became a moral justification to lift the world up to french standards by bringing christianity and french culture. In 1884, the leading exponent of colonialism, jules ferry declared france had a civilising mission: "the higher races have a right over the lower races, they have a duty to civilize the inferior". Full citizenship rights – '’assimilation’’ – were offered, although in reality assimilation was always on the distant horizon. Contrasting from britain, france sent small numbers of settlers to its colonies, with the only notable exception of algeria, where french settlers nevertheless always remained a small minority.
