The age of imperialism, a time period beginning around 1700, saw (generally european) industrializing nations engaging in the process of colonizing, influencing, and annexing other parts of the world in order to gain political power.[citation needed] although imperialist practices have existed for thousands of years, the term "age of imperialism" generally refers to the activities of european powers from the early 18th century through to the middle of the 20th century, for example, the "the great game" in persian lands, the "scramble for africa" and the "open door policy" in china.[1]
