France and britain were both imperial powers in the late 19th century. In terms of managing its colonies, france was better than britain. France sent small numbers of settlers to its colonies, while britain sent large numbers of settlers. Additionally, france's colonies were often much larger and more developed than britain's colonies. Despite france's imperial past, it still managed to maintain a strong sense of identity and culture. However, france did not manage to achieve the same level of self-governance as britain. The difference between the two was that france was more successful in maintaining colonies due to the more extensive and developed system of governance.
