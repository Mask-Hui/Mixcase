Luther's small cathecism is effective in teaching children because it simplifies the apostles' creed and makes each article of faith more personal to the cathecumen. By rewording each article to express the character of father, son or holy spirit in a trinitarian language, luther helps the cathecumen see themselves as a personal object of the work of these three persons. This personal understanding is essential for children to grasp and apply the teachings of faith.
