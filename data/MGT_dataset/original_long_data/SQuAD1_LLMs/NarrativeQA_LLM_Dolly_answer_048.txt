In 'the next major step occurred when james watt developed (1763â€“1775) an improved version of newcomen's engine, with a separate condenser. Boulton and watt's early engines used half as much coal as john smeaton's improved version of newcomen's. Newcomen's and watt's early engines were "atmospheric". They were powered by air pressure pushing a piston into the partial vacuum generated by condensing steam, instead of the pressure of expanding steam. The engine cylinders had to be large because the only usable force acting on them was due to atmospheric pressure.', the answer for the question is 'atmospheric engines used less coal than smeaton's improvement on newcomen's engine'. The reason can be seen in the context. It mentions that newcomen's and watt's early engines used half as much coal as john smeaton's improved version of newcomen's. The improved version of newcomen's used less coal than smeaton's version because smeaton's used a separate condenser which produced a partial vacuum. The atmospheric force acting on the engine cylinders was due to atmospheric pressure. So, the engine used half as much coal as sme
