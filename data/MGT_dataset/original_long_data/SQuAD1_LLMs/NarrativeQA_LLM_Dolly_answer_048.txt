Environmental determinism can be understood in two forms - orientalism and tropicality. In orientalism, certain regions and their inhabitants are stereotyped and identified as a distinct group. These regions are often referred to as primitive, irrational and backwards. The inhabitants of these regions are therefore considered less advanced and, therefore, less deserving of civilisation, independence and rights. Examples of regions falling under orientalism include the orient, africa and pre-columbian america. In tropicality, certain climates are categorised as less civilised and primitive. These less civilised climates are often referred to as "tropics". The implication of tropicality is that the "less civilised" inhabitants of these climates are less evolved and, therefore, less deserving of rights. Tropicality is present in the european colonisation of africa. Colonisation of africa was justified through the theory of environmental determinism. The theory suggested that people in "tropics" would be "less civilized" and therefore unworthy of self determination and independence. The inherent racism of the theory was highlighted by its discriminatory impact. Tropicality was used to systematically place black africans in a racial hierarchy, below the white european races.
