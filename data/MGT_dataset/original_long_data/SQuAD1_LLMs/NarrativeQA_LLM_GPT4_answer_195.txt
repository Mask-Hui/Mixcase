The passage states that in the early 1950s, student applications declined as a result of increasing crime and poverty in the hyde park neighborhood. In response, the university became a major sponsor of an urban renewal project for hyde park. The university also adopted an early entrance program that allowed very young students to attend college, and transferred automatically the second year students to the university of chicago. Therefore, it can be inferred that the university first saw a drop in applications during this period.
