The passage states that luther is credited with "germanizing the christian critique of judaism and establishing anti-semitism as a key element of german culture and national identity." this suggests that luther's views on judaism and its adherence to christianity were anti-semitic in nature.the passage also mentions that luther's views on jews and their jewish religion were used by lutheran clerics during the nazi third reich to justify anti-semitic policies. This suggests that luther's views on jews and their religion were used as fuel to bolster the anti-semitic policies of the national socialist.
