Since the expression used to identify any given series of problems capable of being solved within time on a deterministic turing machine is the set dtime(f(n)), we can see that a problem is in the set dtime(f(n)) if and only if the problem can be solved using time on a deterministic turing machine no greater than the function f(n).
