According to the passage, trade liberalization with poor countries may result in reduced wages for low-skilled workers in rich countries due to increased competition.

However, this effect is considered minor compared to other causes such as technological innovation and automation, which have replaced low-skilled jobs with machine labor in wealthier nations.
