According to howard zinn, going to jail as part of a rule connected with civil disobedience is not necessary for the goal of the protest. The spirit of protest should be maintained all the way, whether it is done by remaining in jail or by evading it, and the goal is to remind the countrymen of injustice. The key point is not to accept jail penitently as an accession to "the rules" and to avoid switching suddenly to a spirit of subservience and demeaning the seriousness of the protest.
