The most basic method of checking the primality of a given integer n is called trial division. This routine consists of dividing n by each integer m that is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the square root of n. If the result of any of these divisions is an integer, then n is not a prime, otherwise it is a prime. Indeed, if is composite (with a and b â‰  1) then one of the factors a or b is necessarily at most. For example, for, the trial divisions are by m = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. None of these numbers divides 37
