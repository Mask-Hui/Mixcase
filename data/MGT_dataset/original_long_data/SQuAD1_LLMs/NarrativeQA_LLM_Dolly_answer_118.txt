Committees comprise a small number of members of scottish parliament (msps), with membership reflecting the balance of parties across parliament. There are different committees with their functions set out in different ways. Mandatory committees are committees which are set down under the scottish parliament's standing orders, which govern their remits and proceedings. The current mandatory committees in the fourth session of the scottish parliament are: public audit; equal opportunities; european and external relations; finance; public petitions; standards, procedures and public appointments; and delegated powers and law reform.
