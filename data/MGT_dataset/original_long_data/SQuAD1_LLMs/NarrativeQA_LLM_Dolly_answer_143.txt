The cretaceous-paleogene (kâ€“pg) extinction event lead to the extinction of the dinosaurs. Following the extinction, a wetter climate may have allowed the tropical rainforest to spread out across the continent. Savanna regions have been shown to be able to expand into the tropics during wetter periods and the oligocene was a wetter period. This would explain the climate fluctuations and the expansion of the savanna region into the tropics.
