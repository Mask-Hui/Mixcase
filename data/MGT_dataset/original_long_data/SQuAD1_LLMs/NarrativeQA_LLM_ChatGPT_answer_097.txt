According to the passage, the 8-4-4 system of education in kenya, which was launched in january 1985, put more emphasis on vocational subjects on the assumption that the new structure would enable school drop-outs at all levels either to be self-employed or to secure employment in the informal sector. Therefore, vocational subjects were considered important to provide opportunities for self-employment or employment in the informal sector.
