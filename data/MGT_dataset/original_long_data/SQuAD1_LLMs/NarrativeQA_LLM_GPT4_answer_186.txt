The university saw a drop in applicants due to the increasing crime and poverty in hyde park, which made it difficult for families to send their children there. The university also became a major sponsor of an urban renewal project in hyde park, which affected the neighborhood's architecture and street plan. The university adopted an early entrance program for very young students, which allowed them to attend college and transfer automatically after their second year.
