The rhine-meuse delta is a tidal delta, shaped not only by the sedimentation of the rivers, but also by tidal currents. This meant that high tide formed a serious risk because strong tidal currents could tear huge areas of land into the sea. Before the construction of the delta works, tidal influence was palpable up to nijmegen, and even today, after the regulatory action of the delta works, the tide acts far inland. At the waal, for example, the most landward tidal influence can be detected between brakel and zaltbommel.
