The passage mentions that many huguenoits settled in ireland during the late 17th and early 18th centuries, encouraged by an act of parliament for protestants settling in ireland. They fought for william of orange and were rewarded with land grants, titles, and settlements in dublin. Smaller huguenoit enclaves were also present in other irish cities, such as cork and porta-riggeton.
