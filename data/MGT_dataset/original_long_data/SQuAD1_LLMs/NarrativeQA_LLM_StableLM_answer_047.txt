In the passage, it is mentioned that sleep deprivation has negative consequences on the immune system, including decreased production of interleukins (il-1, il-12, and tnf-alpha) and ifn-gamma, and an increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin are also mentioned as hormones that support the interactions between apcs and t-cells, and a shift in the th1/th2 cytokine balance towards one that supports th1. Additionally, the milieu of hormones produced during this time (leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin) supports the interactions between apcs
