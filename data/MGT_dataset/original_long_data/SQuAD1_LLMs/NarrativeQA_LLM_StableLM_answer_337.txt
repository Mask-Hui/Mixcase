The pauli exclusion principle manifests itself in the macro world in the following way: electrons in a solid can occupy the same quantum mechanical state, but they cannot occupy the same quantum mechanical state as other electrons. This means that when electrons are densely packed together, there are not enough lower energy quantum mechanical states for them all, so some of them must be in higher energy states. This is what gives rise to the stiffness and rigidity of solid matter.
