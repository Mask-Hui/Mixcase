The answer is 2010. According to the census, southern california had a population of 22,680,010. Despite a reputation for high growth rates, southern california's rate grew less than the state average of 10.0% in the 2000s as california's growth became concentrated in the northern part of the state due to a stronger, tech-oriented economy in the bay area and an emerging greater sacramento region.
