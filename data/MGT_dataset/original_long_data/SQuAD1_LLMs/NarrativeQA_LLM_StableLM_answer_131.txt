In john dalton's original atomic hypothesis, all elements were assumed to be monatomic and the atomic ratio of elements in compounds would normally have the simplest possible atomic ratio. For example, dalton assumed that water's formula was ho, giving the atomic mass of oxygen as 8 times that of hydrogen, instead of the modern value of about 16. In 1805, joseph louis gay-lussac and alexander von humboldt showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen; and by 1811 amedeo avogadro had arrived at the correct interpretation of water's composition, based on what is
