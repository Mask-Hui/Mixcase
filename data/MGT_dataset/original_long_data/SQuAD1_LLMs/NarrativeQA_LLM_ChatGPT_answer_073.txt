The passage states that it is believed that np is not equal to co-np, but it has not yet been proven. The passage also mentions that it has been shown that if np is not equal to co-np, then p is not equal to np. Therefore, there is no commonly believed value relationship between p and co-np, as the relationship between these classes is not yet fully understood.
