According to the passage, private ownership creates a situation where "a small portion of the population lives off unearned property income by virtue of ownership titles in capital equipment, financial assets and corporate stock," while the "vast majority of the population is dependent on income in the form of a wage or salary." in other words, private ownership creates vast disparities in wealth between those who own the means of production and those who do not.
