A non-deterministic turing machine is a computational model that is allowed to branch out to check many different possibilities at once. In other words, it can perform computations that are not based on any fixed rules or patterns. This allows for a wide range of computational problems, such as computing solutions to optimization problems, searching for specific patterns in data, and many other problems.
