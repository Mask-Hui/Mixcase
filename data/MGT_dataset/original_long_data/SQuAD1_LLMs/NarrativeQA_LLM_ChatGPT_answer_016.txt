Reactive oxygen species signals, which are produced by chloroplasts as defense signals after detecting cellular stress, are likely to pass on their signal to an unknown second messenger molecule within the chloroplast. They are unstable molecules and do not leave the chloroplast, but instead, they initiate retrograde signaling, which regulates gene expression in the nucleus.
