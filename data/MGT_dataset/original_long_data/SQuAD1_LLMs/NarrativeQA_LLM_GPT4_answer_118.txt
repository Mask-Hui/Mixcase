Ctenophores are predators, carnivorous and predatory. They have a wide range of techniques for capturing prey, including hanging motionless in the water using their tentacles as "web" and ambush predators like saltiids jumping spiders. Some ctenophores even use sticky droplets at the end of a fine thread, as bolas spiders do. The variety of body forms in a phylum with rather few species is due to the wide range of techniques used by ctenophores for capturing prey.
