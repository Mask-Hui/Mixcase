The passage describes the concept of electric potential and how it is used to describe and explain various physical phenomena. The question is asking for the answer to the passage's main point or conclusion. The answer to this question is that electric potential is a fundamental concept in physics that describes the distribution of electric charge within a system. The gradiants of electric potential are used to describe the distribution of electric charge within a system and the resulting macroscopic forces that arise from this distribution. These gradiants of electric potential are also known as electric charges or electric charges. In summary, the passage discusses the concept of electric potential and how it
