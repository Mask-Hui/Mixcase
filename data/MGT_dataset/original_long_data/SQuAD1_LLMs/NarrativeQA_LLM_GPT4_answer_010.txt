The complexity of problems often depends on what?the answer to the question "what is a problem?" can be found in the passage provided. The complexity of a problem is determined by the class in which it belongs. The passage states that a problem is considered complex if it belongs to the np class, which is a subset of p. The np class includes problems that can be solved in polynomial time, while the p class includes problems that can be solved in polynomial time. Therefore, the complexity of a problem depends on its class.
