Lobates are carnivorous animals that live in marine environments. They are characterized by their lobate body shape, which consists of two main lobes joined by a muscular tentacle. The lobate body is covered in smooth, ciliated tentacles that extend from the corners of the mouth, running in grooves that help them to capture and manipulate prey. Between the two lobes on either side of the mouth, lobates have four auricles, which produce water currents that help them to capture and move prey towards the mouth. This combination of structures enables lobates to feed continuously on suspended planktonic prey.
