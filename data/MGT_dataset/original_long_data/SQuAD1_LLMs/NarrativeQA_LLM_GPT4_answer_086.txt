The passage states that it is not known if l (the set of all problems that can be solved in logarithmic space) is strictly contained within p (the set of all problems that can be solved in polynomial time) or if it is equal to p. It also mentions that there are many complexity classes between the two, such as nl and nc. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the relationship between l and p definitively.
