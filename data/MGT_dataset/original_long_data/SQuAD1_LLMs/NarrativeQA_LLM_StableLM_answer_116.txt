In 1529, luther wrote the large catechism, a manual for pastors and teachers, as well as a synopsis, the small catechism, to be memorised by the people themselves. The catechisms provided easy-to-understand instructional and devotional material on the ten commandments, the apostles' creed, the lord's prayer, baptism, and the lord's supper. Luther incorporated questions and answers in the catechism so that the basics of christian faith would not just be learned by rote, "the way monkeys do it", but understood.
