The passage states that apicoplasts do not have photosynthetic function and contain no photosynthetic pigment or true thykakodis. They are bounded by four membranes, but the membranes do not connect to endoplasmic reticular membrane. The fact that apicoplasts still keep their non-photothetic chloroplasts around demonstrates that the chloroplast carries out important functions other than photosynthesis. The most important function of apicoplasts is iso-pentenyl pyrophosphate synthesis, which is essential for the survival of plants. When apicoplasts are grown in an iso
