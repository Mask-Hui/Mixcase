The passage describes the formation of topographic gradients through faulting and other deformation processes. These gradients are created by the movement of sediment and other materials along faults, which maintain the gradient despite changes in elevation. Volcanic ashes and lava accumulate on the surface, while igneous intrusions enter from below. The passage also mentions that these gradients can be observed across the canadian shield and in areas of active deformation.
