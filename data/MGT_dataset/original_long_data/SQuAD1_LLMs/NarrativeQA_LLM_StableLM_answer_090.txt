On the next play, ealy knocked the ball out of manning's hand as he was winding up for a pass, and then recovered it for carolina on the 50-yard line. A 16-yard reception by devin funchess and a 12-yard run by stewart then set up gano's 39-yard field goal, cutting the panthers deficit to one score at 16â€“10.
