Galileo galilei introduced the concept of force of impetus in the late medieval era. This is an innate force that acts on an object in motion in such a manner that it causes the object to slow down. For example, suppose a stone is rolling down an incline. As the stone descends further, air that is inside the hill becomes thinner. At the same time, as the stone enters the valley floor air gets thicker. When the stone leaves the top of the hill, the air that was thinner on the top of the hill gets closer and closer and thus begins to take in the heat and other elements of the stone. As the air gets closer to the stone, it heats up and the adjacent air starts getting thinner. The stone hits the hill top and the air that was thinner gets in closer contact with the heated stone and hence begins to take in heat and loses its thinness. As a result the stone loses speed and starts to decelerate. What causes the stone to lose speed is that the motion of the stone is not proportional to the decrease in air thickness as a result of air losing its fluidity due to heat transfer. This is because the motion of the stone is not proportional to its weight. So the stone loses speed due to
