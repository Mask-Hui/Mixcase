Some people resist officers of the law in civil disobedience cases because they believe that talking to criminal investigators can be harmful and serve no useful purpose. Some may also find it difficult to resist responding to investigators' questions due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications or fear of seeming rude. Others may use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers.
