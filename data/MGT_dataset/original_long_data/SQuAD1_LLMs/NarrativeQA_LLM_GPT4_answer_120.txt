The passage states that zeolite molecular sieves can be used to produce oxygen gas by passing a stream of clean, dry air through one bed and reducing the chamber operating pressure. The nitrogen gas is released from the other bed, and oxygen gas can be obtained by reducing the chamber operating pressure and directing part of it through a zeolite bed in the reverse direction of flow. After a set cycle time, the operation of both beds is interchanged to allow for a continuous supply of gas. This is known as pressure swing adsorption, and the percentage of oxygen produced by a zeolite bed is not specified in the
