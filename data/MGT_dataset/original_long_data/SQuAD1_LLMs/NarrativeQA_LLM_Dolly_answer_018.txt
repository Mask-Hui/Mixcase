Courts have used the necessity defense to excuse civil disobedients from punishment in certain situations. Sometimes, the protestors would not be punished for their actions because it was considered a political question. This means that courts are not able to do anything to punish the people responsible for breaking a law, so the law would not be able to function correctly.
