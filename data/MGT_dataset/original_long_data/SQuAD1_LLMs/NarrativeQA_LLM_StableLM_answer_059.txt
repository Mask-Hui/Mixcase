The oxygen partial pressure of space suits is not specified in the given passage. However, in general, the partial pressure of o 2 in the breathing gas used in space suits is about 30 kpa (1.4 times normal), which is about the same as the normal partial pressure of o 2 in the atmosphere at sea level. The partial pressure of o 2 in the astronaut's arterial blood is also about the same as the normal partial pressure of o 2 in the atmosphere. This means that the partial pressure of o 2 in the astronaut's arterial blood is close to normal.
