Etioplasts have a less well-known, but quite similar structure to chloroplasts. Instead of having their own photosynthetic pigment, they have an endocorrinlagenous membrane in the thylakoid layers of the prolamellar body that resembles a membrane of the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells. In that membrane there are stacks of endoplasmic reticulum, which resembles the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts. Chloroplasts also contain another protein called phycobilin, which is what absorbs the red to blue portion of the light used by plants to create energy. Etioplasts have a complete complement of phycobilins, but the presence of endocorrinlagenous membrane means that these are bound to a lipid that is similar to phycocyanin, the purple phycobilins in which plants use to create energy.
