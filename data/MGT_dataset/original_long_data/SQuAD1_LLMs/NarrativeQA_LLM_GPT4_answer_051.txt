The passage states that in 1700, several hundred french huguenoits migrated from england to the colony of virginia, where they were promised land grants in lower norfolk county. However, when they arrived at the abandoned monacan village known as manakin town, they were offered land 20 miles above the falls of the james river, at the abandoned monacan village known as manakin town, now in powhatan county. Some settlers landed in present-day chesterfield county. The passage also mentions that descendants of the french migrated west into the piedmont, and across the appalachian mountains into other states.
