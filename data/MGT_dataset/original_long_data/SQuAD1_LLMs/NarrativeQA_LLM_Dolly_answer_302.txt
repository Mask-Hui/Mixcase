The problem of rubisco, which is used by chloroplasts to fix carbon dioxide into sugar molecules, is that it has a flaw that causes it to add oxygen to sugar precursor molecules at high oxygen concentrations. This has the effect of wasting energy due to the additional oxygen being produced as part of the light reaction of photosynthesis and causing extra carbon dioxide to be released. This can have negative effects downstream in the calvin cycle, which uses rubisco, which has the effect of lowering the amount of photosynthetic enzymes used to metabolize sucrose.
