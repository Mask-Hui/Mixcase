In this scenario, the teacher will likely end up getting more resources. The school's policy of maintaining order in the classroom will divert the teacher from instruction and leave little opportunity for concentration and focus on what is being taught. The teacher will likely concentrate their attention on motivated students and ignore attention-seeking and disruptive students, which will result in motivated students receiving disproportionate resources.
