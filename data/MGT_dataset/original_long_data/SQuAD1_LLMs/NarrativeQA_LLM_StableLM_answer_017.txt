The passage mentions that carbohydrates contain the largest proportion by mass of oxygen, with the exception of adenine and pyrimidines. The answer to the question is that oxygen occurs in phosphate groups in the biologically important energy-carrying molecules atp and adp, in the backbone and the purines (except adenine and pyrimidines) of rna and dna, and in bones as calcium phosphate and hydroxylapatite.
