The english monarch, ethelred, was forced out of the country by sweyn forkbeard in 1013. Sweyn's father, eric the young, had married ethelred's sister, emma, when ethelred fled to normandy, which led to the marriage of ethelred's sons with emma's daughters, thereby also becoming cousins to the normans.
