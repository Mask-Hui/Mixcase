China's investment in kenya has been significant, with a total of $474 million in 2012. This represents kenya's largest source of foreign direct investment and bilateral trade with china. The chinese ambassador's comments suggest that the investment was aimed at supporting a planned $2.5 billion railway from the southern kenyan port of mombasa to neighboring uganda, as well as a nearly $1.8 billion dam project in kenya, which were both announced during president kenyatta's 2013 trip to beijing. China has also been causing environmental and social problems, including the suspension of a railway project.
