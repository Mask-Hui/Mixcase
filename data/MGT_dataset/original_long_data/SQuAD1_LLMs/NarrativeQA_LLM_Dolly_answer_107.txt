In the passage you provided, it is mentioned that if a and q are coprime, then the number of primes in the progression is infinite. The greatest common divisor of a and q is one. Let me use this fact to conclude that if q and a are coprime, then there must be infinitely many primes in the progression. Let the numbers in the progression be pn where n is a positive integer. If there were a lower bound for n, then the set {pn | n < k} would be bounded. But this implies there exists an upper bound for the set of integers {pn | n < k}. This is a contradiction, so there must be infinitely many primes in the progression.
