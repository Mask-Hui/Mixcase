Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis of cydippid ctenophores. They are used to capture prey by sticking to it. They have three main components: a domed head with vesicles containing adhesive, a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or mesoglea, and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk.
