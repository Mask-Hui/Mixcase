Dry cooling towers are used in locations where water is costly and is difficult or impossible to obtain. Examples of dry cooling towers include deserts, arid regions, and regions with snow-covered landscapes. These towers are used to provide energy to buildings in areas with limited water supplies or where access to water is restricted by geography or government policies. Dry cooling towers are also used in areas where water is scarce or where electricity is not available from the grid.
