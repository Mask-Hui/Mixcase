The answer to the question is: the judges of the court of justice of the european union (cjeu) are currently 28 judges from member states who are responsible for interpreting eu law and ensuring that it is observed. These judges are appointed for a three-year term and are elected by the judges from member states. The ultimate court to interpret questions of eu law is the court of auditors, which is made up of judges from member states. Under the treaty on european union article 19(3), the court of auditors is responsible for interpreting questions of eu law and determining whether the eu law has been complied with.
