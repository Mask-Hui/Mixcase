The length of the rhine river is conventionally measured in "rhine-kilometers" (rheinkilometer), a scale introduced in 1939 which runs from the old rhine bridge at constance (0 km) to hoek van holland (1036.20 km). The river length is significantly shortened from the river's natural course due to number of canalisation projects completed in the 19th and 20th century. The "total length of the rhine", to the inclusion of lake constance and the alpine rhine is more difficult to measure objectively; it was cited as 1,232 kilometres (766 miles)
