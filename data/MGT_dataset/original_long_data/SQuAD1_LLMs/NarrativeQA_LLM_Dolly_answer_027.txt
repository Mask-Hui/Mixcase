Crime rate has been shown to be correlated with inequality in society. Most studies looking into the relationship have concentrated on homicides â€“ since homicides are almost identically defined across all nations and jurisdictions. There have been over fifty studies showing tendencies for violence to be more common in societies where income differences are larger. Research has been conducted comparing developed countries with undeveloped countries, as well as studying areas within countries. Daly et al. 2001 found that among u.s states and canadian provinces there is a tenfold difference in homicide rates related to inequality. They estimated that about half of all variation in homicide rates can be accounted for by differences in the amount of inequality in each province or state. Fajnzylber et al. 2002 found a similar relationship worldwide. Among comments in academic literature on the relationship between homicides and inequality are: a tenfold difference in homicide rates among u.s states and canadian provinces; and a similarly proportional difference between developed countries and undeveloped countries, as well as between countries within developed countries. Based on these three factors it can be estimated that about half of all variation in homicide rates can be accounted for by differences in the amount of inequality in each province or state.
