The city leaders of bukhara responded to the mongol attack by opening the gates to the invaders and allowing them to loot the city. They also executed survivors of the citadel and drafted young men who had not fought into the mongolian army, while sending the rest of the population into slavery. Additionally, genghis khan had the city's surviving population assemble in the main mosque of the town, where he declared that he was the flail of god, sent to punish them for their sins.
