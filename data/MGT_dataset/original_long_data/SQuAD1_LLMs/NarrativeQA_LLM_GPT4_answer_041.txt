Luther believed that justification was entirely the work of god, and he based his position on the teachings of st. Paul in romans 3:24-28, where justification is described as a gift from god. Luther wrote that justification comes not only through faith in christ, but also from the experience of being justified by faith. He also believed that justification was a discovery about "the righteousness of god," which the just person lives by faith.
