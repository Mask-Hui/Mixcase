"various gold-themed promotions and initiatives were held throughout the 2015 nfl season to tie into the "golden super bowl"; gold-tinted logos were implemented across the nfl's properties and painted on fields, the numbering of the 50-yard line on fields was colored gold, and beginning on week 7, all sideline jackets and hats featured gold-trimmed logos. Gold footballs were given to each high school that has had a player or coach appear in the super bowl, and "homecoming" events were also held by super bowl-winning teams at games."
