The passage states that the first four test flights were launched from lc-34, with only live first stages, carrying dummy upper stages filled with water. The first flight with a live s-iv was launched from lc-37. This was followed by five launches of boilerplate csms (designated as-101 through as-105) into orbit in 1964 and 1965. The last three of these further supported the apollo program by also carrying pegasus satellites, which verified the safety of the translunar environment by measuring the frequency and severity of micrometeorite impacts.
