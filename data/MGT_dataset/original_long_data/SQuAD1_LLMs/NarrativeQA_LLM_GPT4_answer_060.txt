The georgian period in britain was influenced by the spread of printed books and european artists employed in britain. The increasing emphasis on entertainment and leisure led to the production of tea paraphernalia such as china and caddies. European styles seen on the grand tour also influenced taste. The industrial revolution had a significant effect on manufacturing, and for the first time since the reformation, the anglican and roman catholic churches had a major effect on art and design such as the gothic revival. The arts and crafts movement was founded in the later 19th century, which contributed to a backlash against industrialization.
