Indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law which is not, itself, the object of protest. For example, during the vietnam war, courts typically refused to excuse the perpetrators of illegal protests from punishment on the basis of their challenging the legality of the vietnam war. The necessity defense has sometimes been used as a shadow defense by civil disobedients to deny guilt without denouncing their politically motivated acts, and to present their political beliefs in the courtroom. However, court cases such as u.s. V. Schoon have greatly curtailed the availability of the political necessity defense. Likewise, when carter wentworth was charged for his role in the clamshell alliance's 1977 illegal occupation of the seabrook station nuclear power plant, the judge instructed the jury to disregard his competing harms defense, and he was found guilty. Fully informed jury association activists have sometimes handed out educational leaflets inside courthouses despite admonitions not to; according to fija, many of them have escaped prosecution because "prosecutors have reasoned (correctly) that if they arrest fully informed jury leafleters, the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter's own jury as evidence."
