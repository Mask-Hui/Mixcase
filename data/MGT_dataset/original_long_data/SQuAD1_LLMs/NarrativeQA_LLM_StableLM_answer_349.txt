Modern scholars have claimed that genghis khan attempted to create a civil state under the great yassa that would have established the legal equality of all individuals, including women. However, there is no evidence of this, or of the lifting of discriminatory policies towards sedentary peoples such as the chinese. Women played a relatively important role in mongol empire and in family, for example t√∂regene khatun was briefly in charge of the mongol empire when next male khagan was being chosen. Modern scholars refer to the alleged policy of encouraging trade and communication as the pax mongolica (mongol peace).
