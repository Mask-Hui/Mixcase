There are several catalysts that can be used to produce oxygen, including:- platinum or palladium catalysts, which can be used to oxidize carbon monoxide (co) and nitrogen oxides (nox), which are major pollutants in the atmosphere.- copper catalysts, which can be used to oxidize carbon monoxide (co) and nitrogen oxides (nox), as well as to oxidize sulfur dioxide (so2) and nitrogen oxides.- iron catalysts, which can be used to oxidize carbon monoxide (co) and nitrogen oxides.- titanium dioxide (
