Luther feared to cause himself and his family the pain of a life without celibacy. He had written to george spaalatin on 30 november 1524, "i shall never take a wife as i feel at present. Not that i am insensible to my flesh or sex (for i am neither wood nor stone); but my mind is averted to wedlock because i daily expect the death of a heretic."
