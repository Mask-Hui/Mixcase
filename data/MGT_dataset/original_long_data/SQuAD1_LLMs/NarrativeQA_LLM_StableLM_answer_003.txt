The passage states that the availability of the bible in vernacular languages was important to the spread of the protestant movement and development of the reformed church in france. The country had a long history of struggles with the papacy by the time the protestant reformation finally arrived. Around 1294, a french version of the scriptures was prepared by the roman catholic priest, guyard de moulin. A two-volume illustrated folio paraphrase version based on his manuscript, by jean de r√©ly, was printed in paris in 1487.
