Packet switching and circuit switching are both methods of networking, but they differ in their approach to allocating dedicated network bandwidth for each communication session. Circuit switching, also known as circuit-to-circuit switching, pre-allocates dedicated network bandwidth specifically for each communication session, which means that each connection has a constant bit rate and latency between nodes. This approach is characterized by a fixed cost for each unit of information transmitted. Packet switching, on the other hand, may be characterized by a fixed cost per unit of information transmitted, such as characters, packets, or messages. This approach is characterized by a variable cost for each unit of information transmitted
