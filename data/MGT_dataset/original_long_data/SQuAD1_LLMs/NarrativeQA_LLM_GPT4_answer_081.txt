Hobson argued that imperialism was an international phenomenon characterized by the economic and political domination of one nation or group by another. He believed that imperialism was driven primarily by the desire of nations to increase their wealth and power, which was achieved through the exploitation of natural resources and labor. Hobson also argued that imperialism was a disease of the international system, which could not be cured by domestic social reforms alone. He believed that the only way to cure imperialism was through a peaceful, multipolar world order.
