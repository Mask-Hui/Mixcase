Some people purposely resist officers of the law because they believe that their actions are justified and necessary to protect themselves or others from harm. They may also feel a sense of duty to stand up against injustice or oppression. Additionally, some people may feel a sense of pride or personal responsibility in standing up for what they believe is right, even if it means going against the law. However, resistance to officers of the law can also be a form of self-harm or an attempt to control others, and it is important for individuals who engage in civil disobedience to consider the potential consequences and weigh their actions carefully.
