'currently detention is one of the most common punishments in schools in the united states, the uk, ireland, singapore and other countries. It requires the pupil to remain in school at a given time in the school day (such as lunch, recess or after school); or even to attend school on a non-school day, e.g. "saturday detention" held at some schools. During detention, students normally have to sit in a classroom and do work, write lines or a punishment essay, or sit quietly.' the answer in the uk and ireland is 'time-on', which requires the pupil to spend an hour or more in class with no activities of their own choosing.
