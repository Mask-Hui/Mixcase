'if q=9 and a=3,6 or 9, there is no way to determine how many primes would be in the progression because the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and q is 3. However, dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions states that if a and q are coprime, then there are infinitely many primes in the progression. The picture below illustrates this with q = 9: the numbers are "wrapped around" as soon as a multiple of 9 is passed. Primes are highlighted in red. The rows (=progressions) starting with a = 3, 6, or 9 contain at most
