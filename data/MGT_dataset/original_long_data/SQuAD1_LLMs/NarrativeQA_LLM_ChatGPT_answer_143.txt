Religion was handled with tolerance in the mongol empire. The mongols practiced religious tolerance because religion was considered a personal concept and not subject to law or interference. The empire had tax exemptions for religious figures, teachers, and doctors, and religious tolerance was a well-established concept on the asian steppe, with various mongol tribes practicing shamanism, buddhism, or christianity.
