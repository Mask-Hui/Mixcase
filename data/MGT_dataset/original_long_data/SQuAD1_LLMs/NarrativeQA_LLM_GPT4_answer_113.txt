According to lenin, capitalist countries must have an imperialist policy because they are part of a world system that extends over centuries, often going back to christopher columbus and the crusades. This world system is characterized by a structural or systemic form of imperialism that arises from the need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in order to maintain their dominance. This expansion is driven by the desire to maintain power and control over resources, labor force, capital, etc. The term "imperialism" is used to describe this phenomenon, which has been present in various forms throughout history.
