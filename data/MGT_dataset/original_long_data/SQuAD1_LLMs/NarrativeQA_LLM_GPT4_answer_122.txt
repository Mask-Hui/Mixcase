The primary purpose of chloroplasts is to conduct photosynthesis, where the chlorophyll pigments capture sunlight and convert it into energy-storage molecules such as atp and nadph, which are used to make organic molecules from carbon dioxide in the calvin cycle. Chloroplasts also play a role in fatty acid synthesis, amino acid synthesis and the immune response in plants.
