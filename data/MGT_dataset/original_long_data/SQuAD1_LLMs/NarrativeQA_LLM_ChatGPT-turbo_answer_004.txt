The passage does not provide a clear answer to the question of why some people purposely resist officers of the law. It instead discusses some factors that may contribute to civil disobedients deciding whether or not to talk to police officers during an arrest, including a belief that talking to investigators is generally unhelpful and may be harmful, a lack of understanding of legal ramifications, and a desire to make an impression on officers.
