Tesla went to karlovac in order to attend school at the higher real gymnasium, where he was profoundly influenced by a math teacher named martin sekuliÄ‡. The classes were held in german, as it was a school within the austro-hungarian military frontier. Tesla was able to perform integral calculus in his head, which prompted his teachers to believe that he was cheating. He finished a four-year term in three years, graduating in 1873.
