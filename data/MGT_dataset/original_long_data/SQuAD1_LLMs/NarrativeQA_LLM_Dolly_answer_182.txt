King william iii of orange later became king of england, emerged as the strongest opponent of king louis xiv after the french attacked the dutch republic in 1672. William formed the league of augsburg as a coalition to oppose louis and the french state. Consequently, many huguenots considered the wealthy and calvinist dutch republic, which led the opposition to louis xiv, as the most attractive country for exile after the revocation of the edict of nantes. They also found many french-speaking calvinist churches there.
