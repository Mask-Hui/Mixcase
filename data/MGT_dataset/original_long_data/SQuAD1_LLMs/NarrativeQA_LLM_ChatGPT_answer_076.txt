The two main theories of immunity at the end of the 19th century were the "cellular" theory and the "humoral" theory. According to the cellular theory, cells, particularly phagocytes, were responsible for immune responses. On the other hand, the humoral theory held that the active immune agents were soluble components (molecules) found in the organism's "humors" rather than its cells.
