In the united states, there has been a push to legalize importation of medications from canada and other countries, in order to reduce consumer costs. While in most cases importation of prescription medications violates food and drug administration (fda) regulations and federal laws, enforcement is generally targeted at international drug suppliers, rather than consumers. There is no known case of any u.s. Citizens buying canadian drugs for personal use with a prescription, who has ever been charged by authorities.
