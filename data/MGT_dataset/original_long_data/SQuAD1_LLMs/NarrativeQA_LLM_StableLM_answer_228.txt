'after the lisbon treaty, the charter of fundamental rights of the european union of 7 december 2000, as adopted at strasbourg on 12 december 2007, which shall have the same legal value as the treaties, has become an integral part of european union law, codifying the fundamental rights which were previously considered general principles of european union law. In effect, after the lisbon treaty, the charter and the convention now co-exist under european union law, though the former is enforced by the european court of justice in relation to european union measures, and the latter by the european court of human rights in relation to measures by member states.'
