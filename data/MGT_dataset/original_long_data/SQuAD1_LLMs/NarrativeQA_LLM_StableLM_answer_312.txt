The passage is describing ctenophores as predators that take prey such as small larvae and rotifers. The exceptions are the juveniles of two species that live as parasites on the salps that the adults of their species feed on. In favorable conditions, the ctenophores can eat ten times their own weight in a day. The passage mentions that only 100â€“150 species have been validated, and possibly another 25 have not been fully described and named. The main examples of the ctenophores are the cydippids, which have egg-shaped bodies and a pair of retractable tentacles that are covered with colloblasts.
