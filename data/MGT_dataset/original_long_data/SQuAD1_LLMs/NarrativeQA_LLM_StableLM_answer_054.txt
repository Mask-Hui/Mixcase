The relevant cross-sectional area for the volume for which the stress-tensor is being calculated is the matrix diagonal elements of the stress tensor. These diagonal elements are related to the strain (deformation) of the object. The off-diagonal elements of the stress tensor account for the forces that act parallel to the cross-sectional area, and these forces can cause both tensile stresses and compressions.
