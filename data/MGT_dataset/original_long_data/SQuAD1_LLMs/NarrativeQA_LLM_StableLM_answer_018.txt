Cyanobacteria are sometimes wrongly described as being gram-negative, which is incorrect. Cyanobacteria are gram-positive bacteria, meaning that they have a cell wall made of peptidoglycan. This cell wall is thicker than in other gram-negative bacteria, and is located between their two cell membranes. The cell wall contains cyanotoxins, which are toxic chemicals that protect the cyanobacteria from herbivorous animals.
