Chloroplasts in land plants are usually lens-shaped, with a diameter of 5–8 μm and thickness ranging from 1-3μm. The shape of chloroplasts can vary among different algae, with some species having a single chloroplast shaped like a net, cup or ribbon-like spiral. Some algae have two chloroplasts in each cell, which are often star-shaped. In some algae, the chloroplast takes up most of the cell, with pockets for other organelles.
