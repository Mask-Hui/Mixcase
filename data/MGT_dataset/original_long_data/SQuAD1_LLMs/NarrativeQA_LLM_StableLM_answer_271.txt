Leonardo da vinci was a famous artist who investigated the relationship between combustion and air during his time. He conducted many experiments on the relationship between air and combustion, and later, further expanded upon these ideas by observing that a portion of air is consumed during combustion. This discovery has had a significant impact on our understanding of combustion and air, and has been used in the design of many modern devices.
