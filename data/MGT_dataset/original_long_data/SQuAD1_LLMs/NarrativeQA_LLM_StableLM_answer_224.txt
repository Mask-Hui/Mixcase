The passage describes the characteristics of cryptophytes, which are a group of algae that contain a red-algal chloroplast. Cryptophytes have a nucleomorph that superficially resembles that of the chlorarachniophytes, and they synthesize ordinary starch, which is stored in granules found in the periplastid space. Inside cryptophytes, there is a pyrenoid and thylakoids in stacks of two.
