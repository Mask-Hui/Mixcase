Both numerical models and analog experiments can be used to study the formation of orogenic wedges. However, numerical models are more sophisticated and can include patterns of erosion, while analog models are simpler and can only simulate the growth of a wedge. Analog models are more accessible to researchers and can be used in a variety of settings, while numerical models require specialized equipment and software. Therefore, the answer to this question would depend on which type of study is being conducted and the resources available.
