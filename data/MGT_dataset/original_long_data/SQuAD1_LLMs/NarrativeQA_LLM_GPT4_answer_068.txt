The passage states that the norman conquest of sicily and malta began in 1091, under the leadership of robert guiscard and his younger brother roger the great count. The kingdom of sicily lasted until 1194, when it was transferred to the house of hohenstaufen through marriage. The norman legacy can be seen in many castles and cathedrals, such as william iron arm's castle at squillace and roger ii's cappella palatinensis chapel at paleremo. Roger ii was crowned king in 1130, one century after rainulf was "crowned" count.
