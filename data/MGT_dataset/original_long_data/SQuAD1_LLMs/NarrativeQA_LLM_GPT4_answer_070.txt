The steam engine's contributions to the development of thermodynamic theory have been significant. The separate condenser, which was invented by joseph black and independently discovered by watt, was a crucial invention that allowed for the efficient use of steam power. Additionally, watt was aware of the change in boiling point with pressure, which was a significant discovery that helped engineers understand the properties of heat and steam. The rankine cycle, which was developed based on these concepts and the steam turbine, has also had a significant impact on the field of thermodynamics.
