The sieve of eratosthenes is a method for finding prime numbers. It is a simple method that involves creating an infinite number of copies of a given number and then testing if all the copies are prime. The sieve of eratosthenes is an example of a recursive function, which is a method for finding the prime numbers. The sieve of eratosthenes can be applied to find all primes in a given number, and it has been used to find large primes in a wide variety of contexts, including computer science.
