The passage states that john wesley was compelled in 1784 to break with standard practice and ordain two of his lay preacher's as presbyters, thomas vasey and richard whatcoot. Dr. Thomas coke, already an anglican priest, assisted wesley in this action. Coke was then "set apart" as a superintendent (bishop) by wesley and dispatched with vasey and whatcoot to america to take charge of methodist activities there.
