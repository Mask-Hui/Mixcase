Dalton believed that the atomic ratios between atoms in compounds were determined by their chemical composition. He assumed that all elements were monatomic and the atomic ratios between them would be determined by their chemical properties. He also believed that the atomic ratios between elements in compounds would be determined by the chemical properties of those elements.
