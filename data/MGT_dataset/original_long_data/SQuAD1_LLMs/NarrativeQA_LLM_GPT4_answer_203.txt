The answer to the question is that luther's misguided agitation had a significant impact on the development of anti-semitism in germany, providing material for the modern hatred of jews. His writings against the jews were largely ignored in previous centuries, but his position on the jews and their lies was revived by nazi ideology, which ignored other contributing factors in german history.
