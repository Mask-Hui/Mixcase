The neighborhood of sunnyside is located on fresno's southeast side, bounded by chestnut avenue to the west. Its major thoroughfares are kings canyon avenue and clovis avenue. Although parts of sunnyside are within the city of fresno, much of the neighborhood is a "county island" within fresno county. Largely developed in the 1950s through the 1970s, it has recently experienced a surge in new home construction. It is also the home of the sunnyside country club, which maintains a golf course designed by william p. Bell.
