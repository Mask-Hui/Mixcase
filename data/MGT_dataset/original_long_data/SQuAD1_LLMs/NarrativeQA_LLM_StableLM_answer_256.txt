Apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while the final apollo 17 mission marked the sixth moon landing and the ninth manned mission beyond low earth orbit. The program returned 842 pounds (382 kg) of lunar rocks and soil to earth, greatly contributing to the understanding of the moon's composition and geological history. The program laid the foundation for nasa's current human spaceflight capability, and funded construction of its johnson space center and kennedy space center. Apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and manned spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers.
