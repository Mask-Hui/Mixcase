The passage states that if it is necessary to disobey rules that conflict with morality, then the action should be public civil disobedience rather than simply covert lawbreaking. This means that the action should be announced to the public so that everyone can understand the reason behind it and the consequences. However, the passage also states that if it is necessary to disobey rules that conflict with morality, then the action should be covert lawbreaking, which involves breaking the law without proper authorization. This is because if the action is not covert, it is not clear what the purpose of the action is and the consequences of disobedience.
