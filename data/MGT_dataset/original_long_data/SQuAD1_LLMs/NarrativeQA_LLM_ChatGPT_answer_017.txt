Luther's answer to the antinomians reaffirms the "second use of the law," which is the law as the holy spirit's tool to work sorrow over sin in man's heart and prepare him for christ's fulfillment of the law offered in the gospel. He states that everything that works to bring sorrow over sin is called the law, including christ's life, death for sin, and god's goodness experienced in creation.
