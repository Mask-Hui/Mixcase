Apollo 13 launched two astronauts, lovell and jack swigert, and a veteran commander, fred haise, and two rookies, along with a lifeboat called the lm. The success of the first two missions allowed the remaining missions to be crewed with a single veteran as commander, with two rookies. The apollo 13 mission was the third landing to use a single tank as the primary means of propulsion, but the fourth and fifth landings used a single tank and a single pilot in the final mission, respectively.
