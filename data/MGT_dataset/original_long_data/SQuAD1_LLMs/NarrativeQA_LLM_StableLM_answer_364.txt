Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps) are molecules that are recognized by plant cells as a result of infection. Plant cells have a variety of mechanisms to respond to pamps, including through the production of chemicals called resistance proteins. Resistance proteins are produced by infected plant cells and bind to pamps, preventing them from being recognized by other plant cells. Once the plant has been infected with a virus, the plant produces a localized hypersensitive response, which blocks virus replication by causing cells at the site of infection to undergo rapid programmed cell death (apoptosis).
