Chloroplastidan chloroplasts have lost the peptidoglycan wall between their double membrane, and have replaced it with an intermembrane space. It seems that this might have happened as plants tried to lower the amount of genetic material they needed for cell division and this might have happened at a point when genes for the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer had been repurposed for use in chloroplast division instead. Hence, chloroplastidan chloroplasts seem to have replaced one class of genetic material with another class in an unsuccessful attempt to reduce the amount of dna they need for cell division.
