The european parliament and the council of the european union have powers of amendment and veto during the legislative process. According to the treaty on european union articles 9 and 10, the eu observes "the principle of equality of its citizens" and is meant to be founded on "representative democracy". In practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the parliament cannot initiate legislation against the commission's wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and "qualified majorities" or consensus of the council are required to legislate.
