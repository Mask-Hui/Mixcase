As christians, the united methodist church opposes all war and conscription as incompatible with the teaching of scripture. Therefore, the church supports and extends its ministry to those who conscientiously oppose all war and who refuse to serve in the armed forces or to cooperate with systems of military conscription. The church also states that "as christians, they are aware that neither the way of military action, nor the way of inaction is always righteous before god."
