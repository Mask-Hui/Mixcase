Luther had two forces within the reformation. First, he was a revolutionary. He wanted to overthrow the authority of the pope and establish the supremacy of the bible over all other authorities. Second, he was a conservative. He did not want to completely destroy the old church and start anew but wanted to bring the church into the times and adapt with them.
