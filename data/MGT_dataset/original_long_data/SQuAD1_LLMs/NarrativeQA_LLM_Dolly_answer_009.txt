The british museum has about 1130 british and 650 european oil paintings, 6800 british watercolours, pastels and 2000 miniatures, for which the museum holds the national collection. Also on loan to the museum, from her majesty the queen elizabeth ii, are the raphael cartoons: the seven surviving (there were ten) full scale designs for tapestries in the sistine chapel, of the lives of peter and paul from the gospels and the acts of the apostles. There is also on display a fresco by pietro perugino dated 1522 from the church of castello at fontignano (perugia) and is amongst the painter's last works.
