In the passage, tesla explains that he was affected by the panic of 1901, which he had caused. However, he then questions morgan about where all the money had gone, to which morgan responds by saying that he was affected by the panic of 1901. Morgan was shocked by the reminder of his part in the stock market crash and by tesla's breach of contract by asking for more funds. Tesla wrote another plea to morgan, but it was also fruitless. Morgan still owed tesla money on the original agreement, and tesla had been facing foreclosure even before construction of the tower began.
