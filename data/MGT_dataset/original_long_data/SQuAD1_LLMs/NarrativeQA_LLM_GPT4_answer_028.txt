Giving a defiant speech can be more harmful for the individual than not giving one. This is because it can lead to a loss of credibility and respect from the audience. In addition, it can also lead to a loss of support from the community and potential legal consequences. On the other hand, not giving a defiant speech can lead to the individual being seen as less committed and responsible for their actions.
