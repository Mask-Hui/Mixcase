There were other possible reasons that tesla and edison did not get the award, which were that they were not the original recipients, that each sought to minimize the other's achievements and right to win the award, that both refused ever to accept the award if the other received it first, that both rejected any possibility of sharing it, and that a wealthy edison refused it to keep tesla from getting the $20,000 prize money.
