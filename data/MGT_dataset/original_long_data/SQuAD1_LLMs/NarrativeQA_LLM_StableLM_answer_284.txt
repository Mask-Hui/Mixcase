In the 2000s, california's economy grew more quickly than the state's average growth rate, but the rate grew less than the state's average. This is because california's economy was more concentrated in the bay area and the greater sacramento region. The tech-oriented economy in the bay area and the emerging greater sacramento region helped california grow more quickly, but the growth rate remained low due to the concentration of growth in the northern part of the state.
