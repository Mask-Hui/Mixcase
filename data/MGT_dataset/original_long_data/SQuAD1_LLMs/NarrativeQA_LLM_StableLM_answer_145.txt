According to scholars walter krämer, götz trenkler, gerhard ritter, and gerhard prause, the story of the posting on the door, even though it has settled as one of the pillars of history, has little foundation in truth. The story is based on comments made by philipp melanchthon, though it is thought that he was not in wittenberg at the time.
