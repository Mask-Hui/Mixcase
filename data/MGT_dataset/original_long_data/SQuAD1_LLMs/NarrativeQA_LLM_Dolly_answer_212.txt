Chloroplasts are double membrane bound organelles in the plant cells. Like mitochondria, they use hydrogen ion gradient to generate energy and perform necessary activities. It's also worth to mention that chloroplasts have their own dna, while mitochondriae has a continuous dna with their own genome and their own dna polymerase. Also, unlike mitochondria, chloroplasts don't have a outer membrane. The components of chloroplasts, such as atp synthase, are integrated inside the membrane.
