The passage mentions that archeologist betty meggers was a prominent proponent of the idea that the amazon rainforest was only sparsely populated, as it was impossible to sustain a large population through agriculture. However, recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated. Meggers believed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52/sq mi) was the maximum that could be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population. However, this belief was challenged by recent findings that suggest the region was actually densely populated.
