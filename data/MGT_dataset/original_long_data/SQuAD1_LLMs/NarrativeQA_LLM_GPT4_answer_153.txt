Colloblast is a specialized mushroom-shaped cell in the outer layer of the epidermi that has a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive.

Colloblasts have three main components: a domed head with vesicles that contain adhesive, a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermi or in the mesogla,
