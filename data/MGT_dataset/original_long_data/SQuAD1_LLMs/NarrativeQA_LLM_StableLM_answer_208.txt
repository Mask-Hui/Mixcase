The passage is discussing john dalton's original atomic hypothesis, which assumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another. This assumption was based on dalton's assumption that water's formula was ho and that the atomic mass of oxygen was 16 times that of hydrogen, which is now known as avogadro's law. This assumption was challenged by avogadro's discovery of the correct atomic ratio between hydrogen and oxygen.
