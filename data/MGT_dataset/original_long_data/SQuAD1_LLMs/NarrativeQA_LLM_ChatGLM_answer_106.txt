The fourth yuan emperor, buyantu khan (ayurbarwada), was a competent emperor. He was the first yuan emperor to actively support and adopt mainstream chinese culture after the reign of kublai, to the discontent of some mongol elite. He had been mentored by li meng, a confucian academic. He made many reforms, including the liquidation of the department of state affairs (chinese: 尚書省), which resulted in the execution of five of the highest-ranking officials. Starting in 1313 the traditional imperial examinations were reintroduced for prospective officials, testing their knowledge on significant historical works. Also, he codified much of the law, as well as publishing or translating a number of chinese books and works. The liquidation of the department of state affairs (chinese: 尚書省) was one of buyantu's reforms.
