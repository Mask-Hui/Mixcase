In an ideal moral society, all citizens would be free from the use of force, including taxation and redistribution. This is because the ideal moral society seeks to promote individual freedom and autonomy, rather than the use of force to redistribute wealth. The ideal moral society would be one where all individuals are able to pursue their own interests and make choices without interference from others. This would be a society where people are free to pursue their own goals and make decisions without the need for government intervention.
