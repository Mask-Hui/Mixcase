The study found a quarter square kilometer (62 acres) of ecuadorian rainforest supports more than 1,100 tree species. To find the total area of the rainforest, we need to divide the number of tree species by the number of tree species per square kilometer. Therefore, the total area of the rainforest is 62 acres \* 1,100 tree species/square kilometer = 6,200 square kilometers.
