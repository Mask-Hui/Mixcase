In 2009, joseph stiglitz presented evidence in favor of global inequality and against local inequality preventing growth. Stiglitz claims that high global inequality hinders growth, and that a reduction in global inequality would increase growth. Branko milanovic argued in 2001 that increased inequality reduces growth, due to a negative correlation between inequality and education. Inequality is a barrier to development in three main ways. First, less prosperous groups tend to save a smaller proportion of their income than the better-off, which reduces their investments and growth prospects. Second, fewer well-off individuals have the educational skills to take advantage of new opportunities, so they are left behind and grow less fast. Third, higher inequality reduces trust and therefore cooperation. High inequality stifles innovation and discovery, for example in scientific fields where scholars with different backgrounds but similar insights must stay relatively ignorant of the advances of their colleagues, reducing the creativity and efficacy of their work.
