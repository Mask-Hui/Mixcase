In the context provided, the answer to the question is that luther wrote the hymn "aus tiefer not" ("from depths of woe i cry to you") as a hymnic version of psalm 130, sent as a sample to encourage evangelical colleagues to write psalm-hymns for use in german worship. This hymn was also published in a collaboration with paul speratus and was designated as a regular component of several regional lutheran liturgies.
