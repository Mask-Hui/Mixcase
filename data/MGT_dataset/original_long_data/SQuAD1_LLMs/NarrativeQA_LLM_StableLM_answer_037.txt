The concept of force in antiquity was the study of stationary and moving objects and simple machines. It was considered one of the primary means of understanding the behavior of these objects and machines. Force was also used in the study of simple machines, such as the lever and pulley, and was used to explain the motion of objects such as bows and arrows. However, philosophers such as aristotle and archimedes retained fundamental errors in their understanding of force, such as the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. The incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction also contributed to these errors
