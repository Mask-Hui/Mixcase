Electricity is a phenomenon which happens between two conductive objects when they are separated by a vacuum. The electricity moves from the positive charges in the positive pole to the negative charges in the negative pole. This occurs through the action of an electrical force called the electric force, which is exerted on the negative charges and attracted to the positive charges. When two conducting objects are moved relative to each other, this electrical charge separation causes an electrostatic force which pulls the objects together. In everyday life, this is useful for electrostatic coating or electrostatic carpet. When objects come into contact, this electricity also creates a tiny spark, which causes friction.
