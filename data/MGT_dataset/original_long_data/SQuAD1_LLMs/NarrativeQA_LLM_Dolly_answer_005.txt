'genghis khan put absolute trust in his generals, such as muqali, jebe and subutai, and regarded them as close advisors, often extending them the same privileges and trust normally reserved for close family members. He allowed them to make decisions on their own when they embarked on campaigns far from the mongol empire capital karakorum.' 'muqali, a trusted lieutenant, was given command of the mongol forces against the jin dynasty while genghis khan was fighting in central asia, and subutai and jebe were allowed to pursue the great raid into the caucasus and kievan rus', an idea they had presented to the khagan on their own initiative. While granting his generals a great deal of autonomy in making command decisions, genghis khan also expected unwavering loyalty from them.'
