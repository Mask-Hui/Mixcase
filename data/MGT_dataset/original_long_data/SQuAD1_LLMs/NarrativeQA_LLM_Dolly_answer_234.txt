Doctor who and star trek share many similarities, most notably that they are science-fiction shows that use time travel. They each have had numerous storylines and continuations. The most notable of these are the 2005 version of doctor who, which is a direct plot continuation of the original 1963â€“1989 series, and the 1996 telefilm. Doctor who differs from most other series relaunches, which are either reboots or set in the same universe but in a different time period and with different characters. Examples of the former are battlestar galactica and bionic woman. The former star trek series, the next generation and spin-offs, are examples of the latter.
