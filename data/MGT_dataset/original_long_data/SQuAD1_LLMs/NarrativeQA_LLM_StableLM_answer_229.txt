Carotenoids make leaves change color in the fall because they help dissipate excess energy in the plants. They also help protect the leaves from damage from cold temperatures and high levels of solar radiation. Additionally, they protect the plant from herbivory by pollinators. All of these factors combine to create a natural "fall color" for the leaves, which is a mixture of green and yellow. The bright orange color of the zeaxanthin in the xanthophylls also helps to counteract the green chlorophyll in the leaves, allowing them to stay bright and healthy during the fall.
