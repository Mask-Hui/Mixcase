When the mongol armies attacked their enemies, they often launched a dismounted charge that would breach the opposing unit's prepared position and flank. The mongol cavalry would then cut the enemy's communication links, leaving them no effective means of reinforcement or rescue. To further this end, the mongol military would often send spies into enemy encampments in the early hours of the attack, who would be tasked with bringing back information about the disposition and strength of the opposing forces. Once the mongol cavalry had breached the opposing formation's prepared position and flank, the cavalry would then re-enter the enemy formations and attempt to drive them in panic. Often, the mongol cavalry would disguise themselves as part of the enemy formation in order to exploit the confusion and panic engendered by the breach.
