The leaders of the city of bukhara responded to the mongol attack by opening their gates and allowing genghis khan's army to enter the city. They also allowed a unit of turkish defenders to hold the city's citadel for another twelve days before being executed. The surviving population was then sent back to mongolia, young men who had not fought were drafted into the mongol army, and the rest of the population was sent into slavery. The city's surviving artisan and craftsmen were also sent back to mongolia.
