There are multiple reasons for the movement to legalize importing medicines from other countries. One of the main reasons is that it is highly likely that such a move would save american consumers millions of dollars as the fda regulations make it illegal for consumers to import canadian drugs for personal use. However, the move has been met with considerable push back from a minority of american citizens who argue that importation of medications for personal use is constitutionally protected as a 'privacy right'. It is important to note that there is no known case of any u.s. Citizens buying canadian drugs for personal use with a prescription, who has ever been charged by authorities.
