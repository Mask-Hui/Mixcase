The passage mentions that the authority in question is one of few authorities to see the proportion of detached homes rise in the 2010 census, and that this was coupled with a similar rise in flats and waterside apartments. The passage also mentions that the proportion of converted or shared houses in 2011 renders this dwelling type within the highest of the five color-coded brackets, and that it is in a par with oxford and reading, greater than manchester and liverpool, and below a handful of historic densely occupied, arguably overinflated markets in the local authorities: harrogate, cheltenham, bath, inner london, hastings, brighton and tunbridge wells.
