In construction, there is an exchange of obligations between two or more parties. Each party is obligated to another party for the benefits received by the first. The contract must be designed to ensure that each party is capable of performing its obligations. Clear expectations and clear paths to accomplishing those expectations are far more likely to result in the project flowing smoothly, whereas poorly drafted contracts lead to confusion and collapse.
