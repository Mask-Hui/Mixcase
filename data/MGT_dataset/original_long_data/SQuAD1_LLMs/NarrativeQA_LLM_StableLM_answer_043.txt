Ctenophores are animals that live in oceans and seas, and are known for being "dead ends" in marine food chains because they have a low ratio of organic matter to salt and water. They are also sometimes difficult to identify in the guts of potential predators due to their ability to survive for long periods without being eaten. Beroids, which are herbivorous fish that mainly eat ctenophores, have a greater effect on populations than the specialist jelly-eaters. This is because they have a greater effect on the populations of other ctenophores, such as jellyfish and turtles, which in turn have a greater effect on
