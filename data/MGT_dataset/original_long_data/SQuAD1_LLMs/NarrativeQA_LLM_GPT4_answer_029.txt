Dry cooling towers are used in locations where water is costly, such as industrial plants and commercial buildings. They are also used in areas where water is scarce, such as desert regions. Dry cooling towers are often used in conjunction with evaporative cooling systems, which use the rejected heat from a power plant to evaporate water and provide cooling. Dry cooling towers are often made of concrete or other durable materials and can withstand harsh weather conditions.
