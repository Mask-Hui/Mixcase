A force on one part of an object may affect if the object is made of atoms and the force acts on the atoms and they may cause some changes in the atoms that form the object, for example if the force acts along the pressure gradient, the atoms with low pressure will move along with the pressure gradient and will be attracted to the areas with high pressure and the high pressure areas will be caused by the low pressure areas. This can also apply for forces that cause movements of parts of the object.
