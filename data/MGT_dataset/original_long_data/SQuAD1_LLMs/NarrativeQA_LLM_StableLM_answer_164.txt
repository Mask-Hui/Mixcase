Edward the confessor was a norman-educated norman-based ruler who brought norman counsellors and fighters to his court. He appointed robert of jumi√®ges archbishop of canterbury, and made ralph the timid earl of hereford. Edward invited his brother-in-law eustace ii, count of boulogne to his court in 1051, which resulted in the greatest of early conflicts between saxon and norman and ultimately resulted in the exile of earl godwin of wessex.
