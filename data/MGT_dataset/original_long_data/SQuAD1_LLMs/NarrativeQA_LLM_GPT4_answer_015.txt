The thesis that a polynomial relationship exists within time complexities in a computational model is known as the cobham-edmonds thesis. It states that the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related. This forms the basis for the complexity class p, which is a set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is fp, which includes all decision problems that can be solved by a function in polynomial time.
