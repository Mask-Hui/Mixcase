The question is 'what color was featured in promotions related to super bowl 50?'. The answer is 'orange'. Several gold-themed promotions and initiatives were held throughout the 2015 nfl season to tie into the "golden super bowl"; orange-tinted logos were implemented across the nfl's properties and painted on fields, the numbering of the 50-yard line on fields was colored orange, and beginning on week 7, all sideline jackets and hats featured orange-trimmed logos. Orange footballs were given to each high school that has had a player or coach appear in the super bowl, and "homecoming" events were also held by super bowl-winning teams at games.
