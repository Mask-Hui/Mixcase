The scientific field of study that has received contributions from the steam engine is thermal science. The steam engine was an early application of scientific theory, and its development led to the discovery of important concepts such as the principle of energy conservation and the importance of understanding the properties of steam. Additionally, the development of the rankine cycle, which was a key concept in the development of high-pressure and -temperature boilers, also contributed to the understanding of thermodynamic theory.
