The examples of bourgeois architecture that were not restored by the communist authorities after world war ii, like kronenberg palace and insurance company rosja building, are not visible today because they were destroyed during the war. The warsaw university of technology building, which is the most interesting example of late 19th-century architecture in the praga district, was restored after being damaged during the war. The municipal government authorities decided to rebuild other notable buildings in the area, such as saxo palace and br√ºhl palace, which were also destroyed during the war.
