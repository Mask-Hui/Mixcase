Packet mode communication is implemented by sending and receiving packets through a network interface. The process involves setting up the necessary parameters for communication, such as ip addresses and port numbers. Packets are then sent through the network interface, and received by another device on a different network. The packets are then processed and analyzed to determine their destination. The implementation of packet mode communication can vary depending on the specific network and device being used.
