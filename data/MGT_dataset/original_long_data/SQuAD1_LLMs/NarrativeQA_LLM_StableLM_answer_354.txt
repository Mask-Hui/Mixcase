It was not until january 1518 that friends of luther translated the theses from latin into german and printed and widely copied them, making the controversy one of the first in history to be aided by the printing press. Within two weeks, copies of the theses had spread throughout germany; within two months, they had spread throughout europe. The first printing of the theses was done by johannes gutenberg in germany in 1523, and the first printed copies were made in 1524 by beda and benet.
