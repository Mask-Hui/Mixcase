In march 1896, after hearing of wilhelm r√∂ntgen's discovery of x-ray and x-ray imaging (radiography), tesla proceeded to do his own experiments in x-ray imaging, developing a high energy single terminal vacuum tube of his own design that had no target electrode and that worked from the output of the tesla coil (the modern term for the phenomenon produced by this device is bremsstrahlung or braking radiation). In his research, tesla devised several experimental setups to produce x-rays. Tesla held that, with his circuits, the "instrument will... Enable one to generate roentgen rays
