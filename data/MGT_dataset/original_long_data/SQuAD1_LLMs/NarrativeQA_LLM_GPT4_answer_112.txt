One possible reason that tesla and edison did not get the award was because they were both awarded for their work in the field of electrical engineering, but they had different ideas about how to use the award. Edison believed that he should be recognized for his work in developing the ac power system, while tesla believed that he should be recognized for his work in developing the alternating current transformer. This disagreement led to a rift between the two men, and they both refused to accept each other's awards.
