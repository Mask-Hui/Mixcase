The jewish people want to live in a state of their own, where they can be free and live peacefully on their own soil. This is stated in the concluding paragraph of "the jewish state" by theodor herzl. Herzl believed that the jewish question persisted wherever jews lived in significant numbers and that a state of their own was necessary for their survival and well-being. He opposed the idea of a gradual infiltration of jews into ottoman-controlled palestine and argued that immigration would be futile unless they had the sovereign right to continue such immigration. Thus, herzl concentrated his efforts on securing official legal sanction for a jewish state from the ottoman authorities.
