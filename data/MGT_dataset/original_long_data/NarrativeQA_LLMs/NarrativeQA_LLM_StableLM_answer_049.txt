However, some possible sources that may have played a role in the popularity of the stories include the success of the sherlock holmes series created by sir arthur conan doyle, the influence of popular culture and media, and the popularity of the detective stories written by sir arthur conan doyle. The adventures of sherlock holmes were also likely inspired by popular culture, including the works of j.r.r. Tolkien and the adventure novels of karl may.
