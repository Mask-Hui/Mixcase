The estate was finally restored through the efforts of maria wyndham, fletcher's granddaughter, who was the heir to the estate. She was only too glad to restore it to its rightful owner, christopher blake, who had been the descendant of a rich and aristocratic family but had lost his home and fortune and had been working as a laborer on the estate for many years.
