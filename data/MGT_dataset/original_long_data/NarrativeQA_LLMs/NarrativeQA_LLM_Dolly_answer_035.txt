I believe that drexl is killed by the police for being a witness to the crime. Clarence was suspected of being the actual killer and would have been killed if it wasn't for him getting injured in the elevator and his father's interference. Drexl knew that clarence had murdered alabama, so he turned state's evidence against clarence. Clifford was subsequently killed for defying the police.
