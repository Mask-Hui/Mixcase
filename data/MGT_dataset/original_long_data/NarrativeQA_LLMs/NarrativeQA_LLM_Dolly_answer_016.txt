I believe the line between the perspectives is blurred. Hermogenes argues that names have not come about due to essence, but due to custom and convention. I disagree with this statement. Based on the passage, i believe hermogenes is trying to make the argument that names have not come about due to an essential purpose, but rather due to historical accident. For example, he may argue that the names "cronus" and "rhea" could have come about by chance, but the historical reality is they were named after streams. In other words, it is more likely that the name "rhea" came about from a relationship with the god of streams (who is often referred to by the name "cronus") rather than it's arising by chance from personifying deities. Additionally, if the name "cronus" was derived from a name of a stream, then it is likely that "cronus" was similarly derived from a name of a stream, even if the current meaning of the word has changed.
