What is the plot of george eliot's novel "romola"? "romola" is a historical novel set in florence, italy, in 1492. It tells the story of romola de' bardi, the daughter of a blind scholar, who falls in love with tito melema, a young italianate-greek scholar. Tito is a shipwrecked stranger who becomes settled in florence, assisting bardo with classical studies, and falls in love with romola. Tito is also pursued by tessa, a young girl who is "married" to him in a mock ceremony. Tito learns that his adoptive father has been forced into slavery and decides not to attempt to rescue him, which paves the way for him to marry romola. However, tito's true character is revealed when he sells bardo's library and denies knowing his escaped adopted father, baldassarre, who swears revenge on him. The novel takes place during political upheaval in florence, with girolamo savonarola preaching to florentines about ridding the church and the city of scourge and corruption, and piero de' medici being driven from the city for his ignominious surrender to the invading french king, charles viii. Romola becomes a supporter of savonarola, helps the poor and sick, and her faith in florence and savonarola is shaken when tito is revealed to have played a role in the arrest of five supporters of the medici family. Tito becomes a target of the rioters and is killed by baldassarre. Romola drifts out to sea in a small boat to die but is washed ashore in a small village affected by the plague, where she helps the survivors. Romola's experience gives her a new purpose in life, and she returns to florence. Savonarola is tried for heresy and burned at the stake, but for romola, his influence remains inspiring.
