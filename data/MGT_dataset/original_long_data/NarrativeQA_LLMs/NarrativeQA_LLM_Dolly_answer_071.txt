Frank saltram is a man who apparently has a towering intellect, but one that manifests itself only in sparkling table-talk. He has a real and power gift to delight with his conversation, particularly when intoxicated, but other than conversation he produces nothing. Saltram also recognises no obligations or duties, is ungrateful and utterly unreliable, and is apparently prone to immoral acts. He lives off others, particularly the mulvilles, who, convinced of saltram's genius and genuinely enjoying his talk, host him for months at a time. In the opinion of the unnamed narrator, saltram is not a deliberate conman; he simply suffers from "a want of dignity".
