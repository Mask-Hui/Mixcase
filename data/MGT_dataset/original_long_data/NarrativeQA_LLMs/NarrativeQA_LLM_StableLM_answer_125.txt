The goblins turn on lizzie because she has obtained a silver penny from them, which they believe is the price of their fruits. They see her as a threat to their power and she is therefore attacked and attacked again. This cycle of violence and retaliation continues until lizzie is unable to buy any more of the fruits, and is then forced to eat the fruit she does not want to eat. The poem ends with the promise that laura and lizzie will live long and prosper, despite the difficulties they face.
