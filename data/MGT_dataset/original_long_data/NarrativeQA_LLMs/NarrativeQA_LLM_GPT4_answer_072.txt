Clogh tried to secure taylor's position by offering his and taylor's resignations in a protest against the chairman's unwiillgness to fund further signings. To his horror, the club accepts their resignations and bans them from entering the baseball ground again (although clough later sneaks in as a supporter). Derby fans' outrage raises clough's hopes of being reinstated, and he is backed by the majority of his players as well, but former player dave mackaay is appointed manager instead.
