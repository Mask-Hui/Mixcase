The house of the wolfings is a novel that represents a romantically reconstructed portrait of the lives of the germanic gothic tribes. The story portrays the goths as simple and hardworking people who live in the mark, an area on a river in the forest of mirkwood, divided into the upper-mark, the mid-mark, and the nether-mark. They worship their gods odin and tyr by sacrificing horses, and rely on seers who foretell the future and serve as psychic news-gatherers. The men of the mark choose two war dukes to lead them against their enemies, one each from the house of the wolfings and the house of the laxings. The story revolves around thiodolf, the war leader of the house of the wolfings, his mysterious and perhaps divine antecedents, and his possession of a cursed mail-shirt. The story depicts the heroic actions of the goths to defend their families and liberty against the attacks of imperial rome.
