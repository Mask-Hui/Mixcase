Despite the generally favourable portrayal of liza and her family, the book contains many instances of violence (although they are not glorified, nor are they presented as inevitable) and sexual harassment. Some are perpetrated by liza's boyfriend, and others by jim, who also attempts to force himself upon liza's mother. Liza's father is a passive but strongly disapproving witness to these occurrences. Both women seem to internalise these reprimands, and avoid displaying affection towards their partners. Jim starts as a flirt who whisks liza off to the melodrama and theatres, and later attempts to convince her to marry him and to bear his children. He is encouraged to make this audacious proposition by one of his colleagues, and his wife seems to offer him encouragement. But soon it becomes clear to jim that liza is unwilling to get married, and he turns into a deeply aggressive boyfriend who beats his ex-girlfriend. While liza's mother seems to feel no blame for his behaviour, she is likely punished by god for being so overtly receptive to jim's advances. It becomes obvious that jim will never change, and liza becomes increasingly disillusioned.
