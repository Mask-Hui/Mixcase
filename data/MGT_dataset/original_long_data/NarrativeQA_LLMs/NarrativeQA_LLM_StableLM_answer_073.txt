However, based on the information provided, it seems that clough's conflict with leeds united and the subsequent replacement of ramsey with don revie was driven by a combination of factors, including revie's reputation as a ruthless and unyielding coach, clough's reputation for being inflexible and egocentric, and the fact that revie had already signed several talented players and was backed by the majority of his players.
