The question is: who was actually responsible to the crime john was convicted for? the answer is that william wharton, the mass murderer who was arrested and sentenced to death by execution, was actually responsible for the crime for which john was convicted. Wharton attacked the guards and made mischief, which caused paul to order him restrained in the padded cell and racial insults to john, which led to john's supernatural powers and the revelation that wharton was responsible for the crime.
