Truman capote's intentions while in kansas are to document the tragedy of the clutter family and interview those involved with them, with childhood friend nelle harper lee as his go-between and facilitator. He plans to expand the story into a full-length book. Capote becomes emotionally attached to perry smith and richard "dick" hickock, and aids them by obtaining expert legal counsel and initiating an appeal. The appeals process drags on for several years, and capote feels he is stuck with a story without an ending, until he gets smith to describe the killings and his thoughts at the time in great detail. Ultimately, capote returns to kansas as an eyewitness as smith and hickock are executed.
