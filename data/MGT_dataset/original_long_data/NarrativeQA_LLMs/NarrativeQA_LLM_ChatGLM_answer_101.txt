The question is: "who was beth supposed to ask for permission before marrying?" elizabeth i of england was being pressured by her advisor, francis walsingham, to marry someone, for if she dies without an heir, the throne will pass to her cousin, mary, queen of scots, who is catholic. Therefore, the queen is presented with portraits of appropriate suitors, particularly the very youthful charles ii, archduke of austria (christian brassington), who has become infatuated with elizabeth. However, she refuses to marry any of them.
