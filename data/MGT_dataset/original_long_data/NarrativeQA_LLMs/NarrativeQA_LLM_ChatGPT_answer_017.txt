Socrates ultimately decides it is unjust to escape because it would mean breaking the laws of athens, which he considers to be like a parent. He explains that as a citizen of athens, he has implicitly endorsed the laws through his choice to live in the city, and he has lived a happy life following their rules. If he were to escape from prison, he would be breaking the laws and making himself an outlaw who would not be welcome in any other civilized state. He would also be harshly judged in the underworld for behaving unjustly toward the laws of his city. Therefore, socrates convinces crito that it would be better to remain in prison and face execution than to attempt an escape.
