Tsunaron reappears with an upgraded km-14 and seemingly kills jason, knocking him into a nanite-equipped medical station and blasting off his arm, leg, rib cage, and part of his head. The survivors set explosive charges to separate the remaining pontoon from the main drive section and are able to escape the shuttle before it explodes. Jason is accidentally brought back to life by the damaged medical station and rebuilt as an even more powerful cyborg called uber jason. He easily defeats km-14 but is stopped by waylander, who sacrifices himself by setting off the charges while the others escape. Jason survives and is blown back onto the shuttle, where he punches a hole through the hull, blowing out janessa. A power failure with the docking door forces brodski to go eva to fix it.
