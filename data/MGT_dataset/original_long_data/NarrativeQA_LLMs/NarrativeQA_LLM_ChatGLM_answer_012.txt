Socrates mentions that the old language "sounds" like a "barbarous tongue." however, it is important to note that this is a metaphorical comparison, as the old language may not have the same sounds or vocabulary as the new language. Additionally, socrates is not necessarily referring to the language itself, but rather the way in which names have changed over time due to the influence of custom and convention. It is possible that the old language had different sounds or vocabulary compared to the new language, but these differences are not explicitly mentioned in the context.
