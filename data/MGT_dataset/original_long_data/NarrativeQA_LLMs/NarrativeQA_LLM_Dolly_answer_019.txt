There are multiple reasons why tom is suspicious of mr. Peters. The first is the suspicious nature of the con-artist. Tom is already struggling to make ends meet, so to suddenly expect him to come up with a functional telephone within the next year is a bit too much to expect. This also makes him a target for mr. Peters to exploit for his own gain. Mr. Peters does not admit fault when someone almost gets run over, which leads tom to think that mr. Peters does not take those sorts of situations seriously. Additionally, mr. Peters tries to buy his way out of being attacked by a motorboat, but fails to do so, and as a result tom believes that mr. Peters is someone who does not play fair.
