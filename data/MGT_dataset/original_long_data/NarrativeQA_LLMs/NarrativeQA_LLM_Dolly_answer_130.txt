Ruth anvoy is a us citizen, although she spends many years in the uk and was married to a british man. Saltram is a british person who is of some note in the story, since he is a "talented intellectual" who is presumably the anonymous narrator's friend. The coxon fund is left to saltram from lady coxon, though he has no obligation to produce anything of value with it. Gravener is an american who thinks highly of saltram and is trying to convince anvoy to keep the money for herself. Anvoy instead gives the money to saltram, who lives off it exactly as he lives off his friends. Finally, the narrator is asked to deliver a denunciation of saltram's most immoral acts, and he is unwilling to do so if he can avoid it.
