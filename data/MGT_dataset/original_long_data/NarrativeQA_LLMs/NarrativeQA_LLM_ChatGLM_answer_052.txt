Socrates ultimately decides it is unjust to escape because he believes that breaking the laws of athens would be unjust and would cause harm to the athenian way of life. He also believes that by choosing to live in athens, a citizen is implicitly endorseing the laws and is willing to abide by them. Socrates is worried that if he were to escape, he would be making himself an outlaw who would not be welcome in any other civilized state for the rest of his life and would be judged unjustly in the underworld for behaving unjustly toward the athenian laws.
