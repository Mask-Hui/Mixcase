Based on the given context, it is stated that frank saltram did not offer anything to the mulvilles other than his sparkling conversation. He lives off others, particularly the mulvilles, who host him for months at a time, convinced of saltram's genius and genuinely enjoying his talk. The narrator also mentions that other than conversation, saltram produces nothing, and he recognizes no obligations or duties, is ungrateful and utterly unreliable, and is apparently prone to immoral acts. Therefore, it can be concluded that saltram did not offer any material or tangible benefit to the mulvilles, but rather relied on his gift of conversation to maintain their hospitality.
