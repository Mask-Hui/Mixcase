Meister eckhart was a 14th century christian mystic who lived in the middle ages. He is known for his teachings on the nature of reality and the concept of the "ego", or the self, as the source of all suffering. Eckhart believed that the only thing that burns in hell is the part of the self that will not let go of life, memories, and attachments, and that these attachments are the source of all suffering. He taught that by letting go of these attachments, one can free their soul and achieve peace.
