The story represents the lives of the germanic gothic tribes, which morris reconstructed in an archaic style and incorporating poetry. He portrays them as simple and hardworking, galvanized into heroic action to defend their families and liberty by the attacks of imperial rome. The goths inhabit an area called the mark on a river in the forest of mirkwood, divided into the upper-mark, the mid-mark, and the nether-mark, and worship their gods odin and tyr by sacrificing horses and relying on seers who foretell the future and serve as psychic news-gatherers. The men of the mark choose two war dukes to lead them against their enemies, one each from the house of the wolfings and the house of the laxings. Thiodolf, the wolfing war leader, is supported by his lover the wood sun and their daughter the hall sun.
