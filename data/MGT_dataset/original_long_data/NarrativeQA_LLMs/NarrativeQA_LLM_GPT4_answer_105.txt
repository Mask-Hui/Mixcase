Mr. Royall notices how close harney and charity become, but he does not want to interfere. He tells harney that he can no longer accommodate him in his house and that he has to leave the town. He also tells charity that he is going to marry her, but only for a while. He gives them money to buy clothes and sends charity back home, but she quickly returns to the office with her brooch. She then writes a last letter to harney, telling him about her marriage and returns to live with mr. Royall in north dormer, where they continue their relationship.
