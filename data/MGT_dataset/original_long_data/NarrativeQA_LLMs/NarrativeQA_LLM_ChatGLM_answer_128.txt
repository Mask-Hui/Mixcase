I'm sorry, but i am unable to answer your question as it is not mentioned in the context that mr. Damon is anything other than a friend of tom. The story is primarily focused on tom and his relationship with his father, and the events that happen in the neighborhood. Therefore, i am unable to provide a meaningful answer to your question.
