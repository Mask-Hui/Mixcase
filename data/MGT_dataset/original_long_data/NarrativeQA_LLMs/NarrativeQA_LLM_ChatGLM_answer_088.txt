The context indicates that pierre grassou de foug√®res is a mediocre painter who lives off painting forgeries commissioned by an old swindler and art-dealer named elias magus. Magus resells these forgeries for a large profit to members of the petite bourgeoisie who are incapable of appreciating good art. The paragraph further mentions that monsieur vervelle, a prosperous bottle-dealer obsessed with art, is introduced to grassou by magus, who introduces the painter as a grand master. Vervelle and his wife are enchanted with grassou and believe he would make a good match for their daughter virginie. Grassou is invited toville-d'avray, where the vervelle mansion is garishly decorated, and also includes a large collection of grassou's work, including the forgery of a titian. The question is: who buys what grassou creates?
