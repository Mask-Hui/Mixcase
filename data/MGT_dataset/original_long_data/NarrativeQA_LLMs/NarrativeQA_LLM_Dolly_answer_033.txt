On 6 october 1971, american soldier jacob singer was in a village in the mekong delta during the vietnam war. His close-knit unit came under attack and, as many of his comrades were killed or wounded, some of them exhibited abnormal behavior, including catatonia and a bloody seizure. A terrified jacob fled into the jungle, only to be bayoneted in the gut. After the war, jacob woke up in a new york city subway and had a number of experiences there. One of them was to encounter his dead son, gabe. He lived through the war, but now he was worried about what happened to his family since he had been away. Jacob realized the truth that his family was scarred by the army during the war, and one of the reasons was that the army had tried to suppress his complaints. Jacob eventually came to terms with his experiences and returned to his family's apartment in new york city. He sorted through his mementos, including his combat dog tags and honorable discharge.
