Bewilderbeasts have the power to control other dragons by hypnosis, making them obey the bewilderbeast's commands. This power is established when one bewilderbeast defeats another in a battle and becomes the new alpha dragon. The bewilderbeast can also issue commands to other dragons even if they are not in its presence, as long as they are under its control.
