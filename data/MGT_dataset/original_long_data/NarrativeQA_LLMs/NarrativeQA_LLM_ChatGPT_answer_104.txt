Before the shoot-out begins, clarence, alabama, dick, and elliot go to donowitz's suite at the ambassador hotel with the drugs. In the elevator, a suspicious clarence threatens elliot at gunpoint, but is persuaded by elliot's helpless pleading. Clarence fabricates a story for donowitz that the drugs were given to him by a corrupt cop, and donowitz agrees to the sale. Clarence excuses himself to the bathroom, where a vision of elvis again appears and reassures him that things are going well. Meanwhile, donowitz and his bodyguards are ambushed by the cops and mobsters, and a shootout begins after elliot accidentally reveals himself as an informant.
