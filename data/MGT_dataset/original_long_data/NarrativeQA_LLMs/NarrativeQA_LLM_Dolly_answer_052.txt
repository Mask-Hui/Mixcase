On october 30, 1977, jerry goldsmith, bill hudley, mary knowles, and denise willis were on the road in hopes of writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. When the four meet captain spaulding, the owner of a gas station and "the museum of monsters & madmen", they learn the local legend of dr. Satan. As they take off in search of the tree from which dr. Satan was hanged, they pick up a young hitchhiker named baby, who claims to live only a few miles away. Shortly after, the vehicle's tire bursts in what is later seen to be a trap and baby takes bill to her family's house.
