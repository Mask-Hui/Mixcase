Tom does not hate mr. Peters. In fact, the situation with shallock peters is a bit complex, and it's not clear that tom or mr. Peters have a clear understanding of why the two of them are enemies. However, it is possible that tom's refusal to let anyone else have permissions to his patents and his response to mr. Peters' attempts to buy him out of his inventions may have contributed to the animosity between the two. Additionally, the theft of one of tom's airships and the disappearance of mr. Damon may have further fueled tom's anger towards mr. Peters.
