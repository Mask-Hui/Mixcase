I think troilus is disappointed when pandarus's plan isn't working out as he had hoped. Pandarus told pandarus to try convincing criseyde to have sex with troilus, but criseyde isn't interested. Pandarus left to give the plan another go, and troilus believes that criseyde isn't responding to his letters.
