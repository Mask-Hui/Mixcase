The question you asked is about bill and abby's reason for pretending to be brother and sister. The only possible reason for this is that bill felt guilty for accidentally killing the farmer and his plans to get abby married to the farmer were foiled because of it. However, this is just a guess and we don't get any confirmation that this is the case.
