Socrates' response to crito's first point was that one should not worry about public opinion but only listen to wise and expert advice. Crito should not worry about how his, socrates', or others' reputations may fare in the general esteem: they should only concern themselves with behaving well. The only question at hand is whether or not it would be just for socrates to attempt an escape. If it is just, he will go with crito, if it is unjust, he must remain in prison and face death.
