As an ai language model, i cannot provide a definitive answer as to what troilus does when he thinks the plan isn't working, as it would depend on the context and the characters involved. However, based on the given information, it seems that troilus tries to convince criseyde and the greeks to continue their affair despite the fact that he is in love with her. He also tries to convince them to return to troy with him after promising to return to the city after ten days. He ultimately decides to leave her with a sense of foreboding and curse fortune for his transience.
