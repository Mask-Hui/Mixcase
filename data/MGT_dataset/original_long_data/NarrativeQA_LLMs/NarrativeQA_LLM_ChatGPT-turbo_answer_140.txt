Lizzie returns home from the goblin market covered in fruit juice and pulp after being viciously assaulted by the goblin men. She hopes that laura will eat and drink the fruit to ease her pain and sickness. Laura does so, but the taste of the fruit repulses her rather than satisfying her hunger. After this, laura undergoes a violent transformation of such intensity that her life seems to hang in the balance. By morning, however, laura is restored physically, emotionally, and mentally.
