In the passage provided, barabas is introduced as a man owning more wealth than all of malta. This means he is the richest person on malta. However, when turkish ships arrive to demand tribute, his wealth is seized and he is left penniless. Incensed, he begins a campaign to engineer the downfall of the maltese governor who robbed him. With the aid of his daughter, abigail, he recovers some of his former assets and buys a turkish slave, ithamore, who appears to hate christians as much as barabas does. Barabas then, in revenge for the robbery, uses his daughter's beauty to embitter the governor's son (lodowick) and his friend (mathias) against each other, leading to a duel in which they both die.
