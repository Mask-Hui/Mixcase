Dr. Malcolm sayer's patients were treated with l-dopa and experienced a series of stimuli that could reach beyond their catatonic states. These stimuli included catching a ball, hearing familiar music, and experiencing human touch. These experiences helped to awaken some of the patients back to reality and allowed them to come back to the hospital. The success of the l-dopa treatment was a breakthrough for sayer and the hospital, but it was temporary. The patients eventually returned to their catatonic states.
