I am not sure about that. Assuming that john girdlestone was the son of girdlestone the company, and assuming that the business failed because of a series of disastrous speculations, i do not think that john girdlestone killed his son, but that his son rejected the plan, and that his father killed him in order to gain sole ownership of the company.
