Magus makes so much money selling forgeries because he is an old swindler and art-dealer who specializes in commissioning mediocre painter pierre grassou de foug√®res to paint forgeries of famous artists such as titian, raphael, and other famous artists. Grassou is able to sell these forgeries for a large profit to members of the petite bourgeoisie who are incapable of appreciating good art, and magus is able to make a significant income from this arrangement.
