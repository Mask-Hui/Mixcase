The adventures of sherlock holmes contains many of doyle's favourite sherlock holmes stories, but not all of them are told in a first-person narrative from the point of view of dr. Watson. Some stories are told from the point of view of holmes or one of his companions, while others are told from the perspective of a third party, such as a client or a patient. In the case of the stories told from the point of view of holmes or one of his companions, the majority of the story takes place in the laboratory or the consulting room of sherlock holmes in baker street, london. However, the story "the adventure of the empty house" is told from the perspective of a client, and the story "the hound of the baskervilles" is told from the perspective of a patient, both of which take place in a different location, the baskervilles estate in kent and the house in london.
