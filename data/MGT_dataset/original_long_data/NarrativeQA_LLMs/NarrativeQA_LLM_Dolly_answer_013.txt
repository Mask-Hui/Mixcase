I believe mrs graham decides to escape from the scandal that she created by reading mrs hargrave's diaries. Mr lawrence also tries to help her escape from the press of scandal that was brought upon him by mr huntingdon, but is then shunned by the community for his transgressions. He eventually found sanctuary at wildfell hall, where gilbert markham and his friends welcomed him.
