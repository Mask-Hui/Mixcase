Frank saltram was most skilled in conversation and intellectual discussions, particularly when he was intoxicated. He had a gift for captivating and delighting people with his conversation, but he also had a lack of dignity and was unreliable in his actions. He lived off others, particularly the mulvilles who were convinced of his genius and enjoyed listening to him talk. However, the only result of his skills was to lose others' pleasure in listening to him.
