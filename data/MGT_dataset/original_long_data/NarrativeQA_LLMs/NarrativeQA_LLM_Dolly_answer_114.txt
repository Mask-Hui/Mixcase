Here's the question: after finding out that travis fox studied archaeology, one of the men asks him if he knows the folsom petroglyph campground. If travis fox didn't know the place, he would not have entered the canyon. So the man knew travis fox was an archaeologist. Also, dr. Gordon ashe is an archaeologist, and knows folsom petroglyph campground. So he knows the folsom petroglyph campground.
