Elder simms argues that jim should be acquitted because a weapon is necessary to commit a crime. Jim's trial is about whether or not he hurt dave, but it is also a societal contest between jim and dave, two different people who want to be with daisy. Joe clarke argues that jim hit dave, so dave used a mule bone to hurt jim. Dave hit jim with a mule bone and is therefore guilty of an offence. Dave was very attached to jim and wants him to remarry daisy, so it makes sense that dave would want jim to work for the white man in eatonville. The white man jim works for, in turn, would like to be rid of dave.
