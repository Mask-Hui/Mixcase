In 1959, truman capote met william shawn, the editor of the new yorker magazine. Capote wanted to write a book about a kansas murder case, and shawn helped him with connections and access. Shawn told capote that he could interview the people involved in the case but needed to write it down. Capote kept saying that he wanted to write a book so he could read the story, see the photos and the details. Shawn finally told him that if he could write a book, he could have the opportunity to see all the details and write a book about them. Capote wrote a book out of that requirement, and in cold blood was published 5 years later.
