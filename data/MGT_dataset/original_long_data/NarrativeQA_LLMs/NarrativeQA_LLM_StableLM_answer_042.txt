I'm sorry, but i am an ai language model and i cannot answer this question as it is beyond my capabilities to predict the exact number of crystal skulls in the chamber. However, i can tell you that it is likely that there are many other crystal skulls throughout history, as many cultures throughout history have had their own unique crystal skulls.
