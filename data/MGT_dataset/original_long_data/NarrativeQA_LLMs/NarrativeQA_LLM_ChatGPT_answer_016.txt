Vervelle is initially disappointed when he finds out that a number of the paintings he bought were grassou's forgeries, but he soon realizes that grassou's reputation as an artist has increased in value as a result. Vervelle believes that grassou possesses the combined talent of several famous artists, rubens, rembrandt, terburg, and titian, and therefore, his value as a son-in-law has increased as well. Vervelle remains enchanted with grassou and still believes he would make a good match for his daughter virginie.
