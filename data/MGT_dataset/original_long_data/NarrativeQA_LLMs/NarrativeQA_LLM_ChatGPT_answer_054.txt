When laura can no longer get any more goblin fruit, she falls into a slow physical deterioration and depression, and begins to wither away at an unnatural rate. As winter approaches, she ages rapidly and becomes physically unable to do her usual household work. She remembers the saved seed and plants it, but nothing grows. Over time, laura becomes very sick and is on the verge of death. It is only when lizzie brings her the pulp and juice from her own body, which is covered in the fruit juice and pulp that the goblins have tried to force-feed her, that laura is restored to health.
