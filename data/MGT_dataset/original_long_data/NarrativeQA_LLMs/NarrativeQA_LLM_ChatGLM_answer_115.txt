Conan sets off in canoes stealthily to retrieve balthus from the body of the merchant ensorcelled by zogar sag, and the two flee into the woods. Conan tells balthus of the cult of jhebbal sag, now forgotten by most, and the few animals and creatures who still remember its worship. Over time men and most beasts forgot its worship. Zogar sag has not, however, and can control those few animals and creatures who also remember. And they are on conan's trail now. Before balthus can meet a similar fate, conan sets the pictish village on fire and the two flee into the woods.
