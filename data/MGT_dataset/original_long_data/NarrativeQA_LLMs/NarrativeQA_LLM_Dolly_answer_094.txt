It is pretty obvious from the text that laura goes to the stream that evening because she longs for the coming evening's meeting with the goblins. Lizzie, on the other hand, is unable to go to the stream that evening because she does not hear the goblin calls anymore. In other words, it is clear from the context that laura goes to the stream that evening, but not clear whether lizzie goes to the stream that evening. I think the most reasonable interpretation is that lizzie does not go to the stream that evening because she is no longer able to go there. After all, it is clear that laura cannot go to the stream that evening because she longs for the coming evening's meeting with the goblins. Furthermore, the fact that laura withers away and then dies at the end of the poem suggests that laura is unable to go to the stream that evening because of her physical deterioration. This further supports the interpretation that lizzie does not go to the stream that evening because she is no longer able to go there.
