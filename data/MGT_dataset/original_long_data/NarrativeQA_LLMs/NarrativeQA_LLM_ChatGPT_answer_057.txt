Soames discovers that his only mention in the future is in a single scholarly article, which describes him as a third-rate poet who believes himself to be a great genius and makes a bargain with the devil to know what posterity thinks of him. The article is a discussion of a fictional story written by max beerbohm, which features a character named enoch soames. The description of soames's contribution to poetry in the future is vague and nondescript, and he is virtually unknown and forgotten.
