Capote's intentions while in kansas are to document the clutter family tragedy and interview those involved with the clutter family, with childhood friend nelle harper lee as his go-between and facilitator. He also wants to gain access to the murderers, perry smith and richard "dick" hickock, by using flattery, bribery, and a keen insight into the human condition. Ultimately, he intends to expand the story into a full-length book.
