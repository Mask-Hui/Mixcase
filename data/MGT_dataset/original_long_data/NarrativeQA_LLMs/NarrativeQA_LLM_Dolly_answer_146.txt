Saltram ultimately gets the money because anvoy ultimately chose to break her engagement with gravener instead of breaking saltram's. She ultimately does not read the letter as she ultimately did not read the sealed envelope that was given to her by the narrator. Ultimately, the mulvilles and others lose the pleasure of saltram's conversation as ultimately the narrator denied saltram access to the money that was awarded to him.
