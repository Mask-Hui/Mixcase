Vervelle is impressed with grassou because he has been introduced to him by elias magus as a grand master, and vervelle and his wife are enchanted with him. Vervelle and his wife also have a large collection of grassou's work in their home, including a forgery of a titian, and they believe grassou to possess the combined talent of rubens, rembrandt, terburg, and titian. Despite the fact that grassou's paintings are forgeries, vervelle and his wife are unable to appreciate good art and are therefore easily fooled by magus and grassou.
