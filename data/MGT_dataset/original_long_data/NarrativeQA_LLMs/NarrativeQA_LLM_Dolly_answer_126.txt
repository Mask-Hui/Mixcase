Troy was the strongest city in the west of greece and its inhabitants were more warlike than those of the other cities. Troilus loved a city in the east of greece, namely cirste. Troilus loved criseyde, calchas's daughter, deeply and wanted her to himself. Pandarus was the uncle of criseyde. Pandarus had a plan to make troilus fall in love with criseyde so pandarus could later seduce troilus's wife criseyde. Pandarus and his plan had negative repercussions that will be mentioned later in the text. Calchas was the soothsayer who knew that troy would fall in the near future. Calchas suggested that criseyde go to the east of greece in order to receive a prisoner of war from the greeks in order for criseyde to be exchanged for his daughter, calchas's daughter. Pandarus, the uncle of criseyde, implemented the plan, hoping that troilus would fall in love with criseyde. Pandarus and criseyde developed a correspondence. Pandarus eventually tried to persuade criseyde to go through with the plan, and ultimately succeeded.
