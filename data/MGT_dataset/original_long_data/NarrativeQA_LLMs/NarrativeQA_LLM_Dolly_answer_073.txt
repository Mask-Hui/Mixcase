In 1895, decepticon arch-enemy megatron crashed in the arctic circle after an unsuccessful mission to find the allspark, a transformer artifact that would bring life to cybertron. Unable to bring the allspark back to life, megatron froze, and a great-great-grandson, named sam witwicky, discovered the frozen decepticon when he went searching for snowmobile ice-kissing sites. Megatron was in possession of a navigational device, which scanned the allspark's coordinates into the glasses owner's possession. The glasses, which eventually led to the involvement of the descendant of a wwii marine, the camaro, the new car of the film.
