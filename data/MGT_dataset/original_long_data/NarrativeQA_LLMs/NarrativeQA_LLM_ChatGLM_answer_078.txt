The city described when talking about the laws of man is athens. The laws of athens are the set of moral and ethical principles that govern the behavior of the citizens of athens and are considered to be the foundation of the city's culture and way of life. The laws provide a framework for behavior that is considered just and moral, and they are considered to be the standard by which all other cities and nations are measured. In the context of the dialogue, socrates uses the voice of the laws of athens to explain why it would be unjust for him to escape from his cell, and he convinces crito to stay in prison rather than violate the laws and leave the city.
