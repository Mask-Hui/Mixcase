Frank saltram was most skilled in sparkling table-talk, or in other words, he had a gift for conversation that delighted others. This was particularly evident when he was intoxicated. However, despite his apparent intellectual abilities, he produced nothing of intellectual value other than his conversation. Saltram also had shortcomings of character, including being ungrateful, unreliable, and prone to immoral acts. He lived off others, particularly the mulvilles, who hosted him for months at a time.
