It's a great question, and one i don't have a definitive answer to. But let me offer you some context. Esther is a 33-year-old woman who has been posed as a 9-year-old girl for most of her life in order to prey upon innocent men. She has murdered at least seven of them, and john, one of her targets, was her intended victim. Through a series of coincidences, she ended up impersonating a 9-year-old girl and attempted to murder kate and daniel at their home. My answer to your question is that esther was attempting to murder daniel at the hospital, because she couldn't kill him in his room because he witnessed her murder john, and because she assumed kate would be at home and likely in her husband's hands.
