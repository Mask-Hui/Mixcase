Dr. Sayer's patients, who were in a catatonic state, were treated with l-dopa, and it yielded astounding results. Leonard lowe was the first to "awaken" from his catatonic state and communicate with dr. Sayer. However, as time passed, they found that l-dopa was only a temporary measure. Leonard was the first to demonstrate the limited duration of this period of "awakening". He started to suffer full body spasms and eventually returned to his catatonic state. The other patients also eventually returned to catatonia, no matter how much their l-dopa dosages were increased. Although the "awakening" did not last, dr. Sayer noted that another kind of "awakening" took place - one of learning to appreciate and live life. The patients were treated with more respect and care, and dr. Sayer himself overcame his painful shyness and began to socialize more.
