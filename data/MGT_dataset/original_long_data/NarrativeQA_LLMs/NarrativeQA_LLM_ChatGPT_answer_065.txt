Stepan is anna's uncle and he is also a former kgb officer. The context mentions that anna asks stepan for help with the translation of the diary, and that he urges caution when anna sets out to track down tatiana's family. However, the question specifically asks for the word that describes the relationship between semyon and stepan. From the context, it is clear that semyon and stepan do not have a friendly relationship. In fact, semyon distrusts stepan and orders nikolai to kill him. Stepan goes missing, but later it is revealed that he is safe and hiding in a 5-star hotel in edinburgh for protection. Therefore, the word that describes the relationship between semyon and stepan is "hostile".
