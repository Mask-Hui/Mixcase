Thank you for the context, now i can answer the question. Fletcher had just won a high-profile case and, as part of the victory speech, had exclaimed that he lied for his son max one day. Fletcher felt terrible about lying to his son and started over-exaggerating the truth for his son's benefit. Because max wished for fletcher to tell the truth for only one day, fletcher decided to lie for his son's benefit for one more day. This ended up backfiring as fletcher, in his excitement, told the truth during a court case that went wrong and caused max to lose his father. Fletcher's broken legs were the unfortunate collateral damage of this unfortunate incident.
