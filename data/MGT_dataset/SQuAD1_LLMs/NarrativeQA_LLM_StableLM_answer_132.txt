Packet mode communication is implemented by routers or switches that forward packets to their final destination. This may be implemented without intermediate forwarding nodes, as shown in the example. Packets may be buffered in network devices before being forwarded to their final destination. This buffering allows for efficient use of network resources and ensures that packets are delivered reliably. The scheduling discipline used for forwarding packets may vary depending on the specific use case, such as weighted fair queuing or leaky bucket. Additionally, packets may be delivered according to a multiple access scheme such as the Internet Protocol (IP) or the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
