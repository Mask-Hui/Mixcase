Singlet oxygen is made in the troposphere by a process called photolysis. This occurs when sunlight breaks down ozone molecules, which are present in the atmosphere. The process involves a series of chemical reactions that result in the formation and release of singlet oxygen. The exact mechanism by which this occurs is not fully understood, but it involves the transfer of energy from one molecule to another, resulting in the formation of singlet oxygen.
