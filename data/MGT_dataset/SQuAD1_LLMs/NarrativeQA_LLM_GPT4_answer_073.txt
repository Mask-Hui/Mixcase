Tesla went to Karlovac in order to attend school at the Higher Real Gymnasium, where he was profoundly influenced by a math teacher named Martin SekuliÄ‡. The classes were held in German, as it was a school within the Austro-Hungarian Military Frontier. Tesla was able to perform integral calculus in his head, which prompted his teachers to believe that he was cheating. He finished a four-year term in three years, graduating in 1873.
