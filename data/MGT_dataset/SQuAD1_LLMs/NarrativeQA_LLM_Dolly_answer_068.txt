The name Huguon could suggest the derogatory inference of superstitious worship. Popular fancy held that the name Huguon suggested the ghost of le roi Huguet and other spirits, who instead of being in Purgatory came back to harm the living at night. It was in this place in Tours that the prétendus réformés (these supposedly "reformed"s) habitually gathered at night, both for political purposes, and for prayer and singing psalms. Such explanations have been traced to the contemporary, Reguier de la Plancha (d. 1560), who in De l'Estat de France offered the following account as to the origin of the name, as cited by The Cape Monthly.
