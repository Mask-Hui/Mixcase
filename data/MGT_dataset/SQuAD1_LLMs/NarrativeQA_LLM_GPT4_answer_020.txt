Chloroplasts in plant cells can orient themselves to best suit the available light. In low-light conditions, they will spread out in a sheet to maximize the surface area for absorption of light. Under intense light, they will seek shelter by aligning in vertical columns along the plant cell's cell wall or turning sideways to protect themselves from photooxidation damage. This ability to distribute chloroplasts may be the reason why land plants evolved to have many small chloroplasts instead of a few big ones. Chloroplasts movement is considered one of the most closely regulated stimulus-response systems that can be found in plants.
