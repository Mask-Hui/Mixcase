The Huguenots were a religious group in France that had splintered off from the Roman Catholic Church, hence they are generally referred to as the "Protestant" or "Calvinist" Church in English-language sources. Their aim was to establish an independent church in the south of France that rejected papal authority. Under the French monarchs Charles IX, Henri III, and Louis XIII, the French Catholic Church waged a number of purges against it in order to root out its former adherents. Some Huguenots were killed during the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre (1572) which took place when the Catholic Church's assassins mistakenly believed that they were killing Huguenots. This resulted in the deaths of 5,000 to 30,000. It was a kind of revenge for the thousands of Huguenots that had been killed during the French Catholic Church's Wars of Religion against the Roman Catholic Church from 1562 to 1572.

It should also be noted that there were underlying political reasons for this as well, as some of the Huguenots were nobles trying to establish separate centers of power in southern France.
