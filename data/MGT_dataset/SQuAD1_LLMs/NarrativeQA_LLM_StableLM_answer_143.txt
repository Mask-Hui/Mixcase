As a language model, I cannot provide my own answer as I do not have personal beliefs or opinions. However, I can provide information based on the context you have provided. The European Court of Justice, which is bound to draw inspiration from the constitutional traditions common to the member states, has recognized fundamental rights as integral part of the general principles of European Union law. Therefore, the European Court of Justice cannot uphold measures which are incompatible with fundamental rights recognised and protected in the constitutions of member states. As such, the European Court of Justice is likely to draw inspiration from the constitutional traditions common to the member states.
