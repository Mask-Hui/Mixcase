The two main theories of immunity at the end of the 19th century were Cellular and Humoral. 

The Cellular theory of immunity was represented, among others, by Elie Metchnikoff. According to this theory, phagocytes were responsible for immune responses. 

In contrast, the Humoral theory of immunity, held, among others, by Robert Koch and Emil von Behring, stated that the active immune agents were soluble components (molecules) found in the organism’s “humors” rather than its cells.
