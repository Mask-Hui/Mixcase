A good example of moral civil disobedience is the case of Shiphrah and Puah, who refused a direct order of Pharaoh but misrepresented how they did it. This shows that disobedience can be traced back to the Book of Exodus, where Moses disobeyed Pharaoh's order to let the Israelites go. This example highlights that civil disobedience can be a form of resistance against unjust laws or policies, even if it is not done openly.
