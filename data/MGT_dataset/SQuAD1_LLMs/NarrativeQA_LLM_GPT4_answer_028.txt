The passage mentions that the British blockade of French coastline limited their shipping, which in turn affected the supply of New France. The difficult winter and a poor harvest in 1757 also contributed to the shortage of food and resources. Additionally, Montcalm's schemes to supply the colony inflated prices and were believed by him to line his pockets, which further exacerbated the situation. The outbreak of smallpox among western tribes in 1758 also played a role, as it was spread through crowded conditions at William Henry after the battle.
