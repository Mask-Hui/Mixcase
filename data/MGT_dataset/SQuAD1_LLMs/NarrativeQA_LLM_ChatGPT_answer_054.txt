According to the passage, one possible reason that Tesla and Edison did not get the award was their animosity toward each other. They each sought to minimize the other's achievements and right to win the award, and both refused to accept the award if the other received it first. Additionally, there are claims that a wealthy Edison refused the award to keep Tesla from getting the prize money.
