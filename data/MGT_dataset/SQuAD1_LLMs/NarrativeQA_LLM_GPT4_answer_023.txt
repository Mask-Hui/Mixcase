Chloroplasts, like mitochondria, use the potential energy stored in an H+ or hydrogen ion gradient to generate ATP energy. The two photosystems capture light energy to energize electrons taken from water, and release them down an electron transport chain. The molecules between the photosystems harness electrons' energy to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space, creating a concentration gradient. The hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space then diffuse back down their concentration gradient, flowing back out into the stroma through ATP synthase. The energy from the flowing hydrogen ions is used by ATP synthase to phosphory
