The passage states that private schools in the Philippines have been a major provider of educational services, accounting for about 80% of tertiary enrollment. Private schools have proven to be efficient in resource utilization. Per unit costs are generally lower when compared to public schools. This situation is more evident at the tertiary level. Government regulations have given private education more flexibility and autonomy in recent years, notably by lifting the moratorium on applications for new courses, new schools and conversions. Private education has also been liberalized in terms of tuition fee policy for private schools. The revised Manual of Regulations for Private Schools in August 1992 has also been issued.
