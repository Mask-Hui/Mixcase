Both civil disobedience and civil rebellion are justified by constitutional defects, but rebellion is much more destructive. Therefore, the defects justifying rebellion must be much more serious than those justifying disobedience. Based on that analysis, it cannot be argued that civil disobedients' use of force and violence is justified. The defects of civil disobedience do not allow for its use of force and violence.
