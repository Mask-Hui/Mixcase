In the first response I provided, one of the reasons civil disobedient defendants are more likely to receive a harsher sentence is that they were disrespectful during their allocution speeches. In other words, giving a defiant speech is disrespectful and this lack of respect might encourage the defendant to engage in similar behavior in the future.
