According to the passage, one third of the water flow volume of the Rhine flows farther west, through the Waal and then, via the Merwede and Nieuwe Merwede (De Biesbosch), merging with the Meuse, into the North Sea. Therefore, the question should be 'How much of the water flow does the Waal get from the Rhine?'.
