The advantage of the two-phase AC system was that it provided a more reliable and efficient way to transmit power generated at the Niagara Falls. The Westiinghous system was able to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current, which was a significant advancement in the field of electrical power transmission. The two-phase AC system was also more cost effective than the other competing systems, as it was able to transmit power over longer distances without the need for additional equipment. Overall, Tesla's advice and Westiinghouse Electric's demonstration of a complete AC system at the Columbia Exhibition helped to secure contracts for building a two
