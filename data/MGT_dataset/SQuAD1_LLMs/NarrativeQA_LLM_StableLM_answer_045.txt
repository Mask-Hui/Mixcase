In the context provided, the answer to the question is that Luther wrote the hymn "Aus tiefer Not" ("From depths of woe I cry to you") as a hymnic version of Psalm 130, sent as a sample to encourage evangelical colleagues to write psalm-hymns for use in German worship. This hymn was also published in a collaboration with Paul Speratus and was designated as a regular component of several regional Lutheran liturgies.
