Ctenophores are predators, they are not vegetarian or parasitic. There are only two vegetarian ctenophores namely Beroe and Eudis Bluemner (2020). Most of the ctenophores are predators that include Cylindrobrachia, Pleurobrachia, Epmeiocestrina, Acindrostremma and Ctenopelmatus. Epmeiocestrina is even parasitic to other ctenophores. Cylindrobrachia and Pleurobrachia have been considered as vegetarian ctenophores. The question does not mention Lampea which is a ctenophore of the genus Pleurobrachia and only predators Bolinopsis and other lobate ctenophores.
