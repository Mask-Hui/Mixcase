Precisely dating rocks within the stratigraphy section is important because it provides a better understanding of the timing and rates at which different rock units were deposited. By understanding the timing and rates of deposition, scientists can better understand the geological history and formation of different regions. Precise dating also helps to identify potential sources of oil and gas, as well as to identify areas of high mineralization. Additionally, precise dating can help to identify areas of potential environmental impact, such as oil spills or landfills.
