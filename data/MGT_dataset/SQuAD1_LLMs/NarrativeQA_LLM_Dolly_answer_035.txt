The three sources of European Union law are primary law, secondary law and supplementary law.
The main sources of primary law are the Treaties establishing the European Union.
Secondary sources include regulations and directives which are based on the Treaties.
The legislature of the European Union is principally composed of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, which under the Treaties may establish secondary law to pursue the objective set out in the Treaties.
