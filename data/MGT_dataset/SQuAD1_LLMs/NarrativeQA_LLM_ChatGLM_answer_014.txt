Structural geologists use microscopic analysis of oriented thin sections of geologic samples to observe the fabric within the rocks. This is done by taking small slices of the rocks and comparing them to a reference model to determine the structure and orientation of the fibers within the rocks. The information obtained from this analysis gives information about strain within the crystalline structure of the rocks.
