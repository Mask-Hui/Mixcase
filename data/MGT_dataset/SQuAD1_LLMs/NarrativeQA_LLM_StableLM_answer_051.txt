I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I cannot provide a detailed answer as there are too many buildings listed in Grainger Town, and I do not have access to the latest updates. However, I can suggest that you visit the official website of Newcastle upon Tyne and check the list of Grainger Town's buildings. Additionally, you can also visit the local historical society or contact the local government office for more information.
