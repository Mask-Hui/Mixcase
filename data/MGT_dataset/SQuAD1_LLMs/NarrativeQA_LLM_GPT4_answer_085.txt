Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching (DAMS) was a concept developed by Paul Baran in the late 1950s to provide a fault-tolerant, efficient routing method for telecommunications messages as part of a research program at the RAND Corporation, funded by the US Department of Defense. It contrasted and contradicted established principles for pre-allocating network bandwidth, largely fortified by the development of telecommunications in Bell System. The concept found little resonance among network implementers until the independent work of Donald Davies at NPAL in the late 1960s. He is credited with coining the modern name packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching
