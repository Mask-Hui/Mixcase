In his writings, Tesla did not explicitly mention the subatomic particle that he believed to be the source of all electricity. However, he did state that the nature of electricity was beyond the scope of his scientific understanding and that he believed it to be a fundamentally different form of energy that was not subject to the laws of physics. He also did not believe that the electrons he thought were the fundamental particles were in fact separate particles, but rather that they were part of a higher-level structure that could be observed and measured through scientific experiments.
