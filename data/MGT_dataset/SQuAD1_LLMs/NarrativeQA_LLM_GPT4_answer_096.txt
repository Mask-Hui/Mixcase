Martin Luther believed that salvation and eternal life are received as a free gift of God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ as the redeemer from sin. He challenged the authority and office of the Pope by teaching that the Bible is the only source of divinely revealed knowledge from God and opposed sacerdotalism by considering all baptized Christians to be a holy priesthood. Those who identify with these teachings are called Lutherans, even though he insisted on Christian or Evangelical as the only acceptable names for individuals who professed Christ.
