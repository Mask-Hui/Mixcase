There was a depreciation of the industrialized nations' dollars because the US abandoned the Gold Exchange Standard and all other currencies were pegged to the dollar, which was left to "float" according to market demand. This led to unpredictable fluctuations in currency values, causing the other industrialized nations to increase their reserves (by expanding their money supplies) by amounts far greater than before.
