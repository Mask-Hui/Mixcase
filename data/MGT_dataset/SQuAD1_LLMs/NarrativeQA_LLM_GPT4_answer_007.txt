The passage states that the three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined. The Oxfam report claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals own as much wealth as the poorer half of the global population combined. However, this claim has been questioned on the basis of methodology used. The Oxfam report uses net wealth, which adds up assets and subtracts debts. Anthony Shorrock, the lead author of the report which is one of the sources of Oxfam's data, considers this criticism to be a "silently argument" and "a non-issue . . . a diversion."
