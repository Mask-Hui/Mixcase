The Grand Canal started in southern China. It started in Bianjing (in present-day Changzhou). Kublai Khan promoted commercial, scientific, and cultural growth. He supported the merchants of the Silk Road trade network by protecting the Mongol postal system, constructing infrastructure, providing loans that financed trade caravans, and encouraging the circulation of paper banknotes (éˆ”, Chao). Pax Mongolica, Mongol peace, enabled the spread of technologies, commodities, and culture between China and the West.
