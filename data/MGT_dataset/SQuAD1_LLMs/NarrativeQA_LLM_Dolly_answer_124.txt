The question doesn't make sense. The passage doesn't mention the number of points the Broncos scored in the final three minutes of the game. However, the answer is as follows: 11 points. The paragraph mentions that the Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round. This means that they had to play against the Steelers again in the AFC Championship Game. By the time the game ended, the Steelers had already lost. In that case, the passage refers to the number of points the Steelers lost against the Broncos, 23 - 16 = 7. And then, in the final three minutes of the game, the Steelers had to add 11 - 7 = 4 points, which they also managed to do.
