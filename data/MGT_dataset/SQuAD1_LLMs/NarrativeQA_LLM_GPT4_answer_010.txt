Philosophers in antiquity used the concept of force to study stationary and moving objects, as well as simple machines. They believed that a force was required to maintain motion, even at constant velocity. However, thinkers such as Aristotle and Archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force, such as an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction and an inadequate view of the nature of natural motion. These misunderstandings were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton, who formulated laws of motion that were not improved upon for nearly three hundred years. Einstein's theory of relativity provided insight into the forces produced by gravity
