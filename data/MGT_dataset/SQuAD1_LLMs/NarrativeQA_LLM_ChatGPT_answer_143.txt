Religion was handled with tolerance in the Mongol Empire. The Mongols practiced religious tolerance because religion was considered a personal concept and not subject to law or interference. The empire had tax exemptions for religious figures, teachers, and doctors, and religious tolerance was a well-established concept on the Asian steppe, with various Mongol tribes practicing Shamanism, Buddhism, or Christianity.
