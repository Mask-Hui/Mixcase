In U.S. v. Burgos-Andujar, the defendant's defiant speech suggested a lack of remorse, an attempt to avoid responsibility for her actions, and even a likelihood of repeating her illegal actions, which led to an increase in her sentence. This means that giving a defiant speech is sometimes more harmful for the individual because it increases the likelihood of consequences for their actions.
