The passage states that ozone is a reactive allotrope of oxygen, which absorbs strongly in the UV region of the spectrum. It is produced in the upper atmosphere when oxygen combines with atomic oxygen made by the splitting of O2 by ultraviolet radiation. Near the Earth's surface, it is a pollutant formed as a by-product of automobile exhaust. The metastable molecule tetraoxygen (O4) was discovered in 2001, and it is assumed to exist as a rhomboidal O8 cluster. This phase has the potential to be a much more powerful oxidizer than either O2 or O3, and may be
