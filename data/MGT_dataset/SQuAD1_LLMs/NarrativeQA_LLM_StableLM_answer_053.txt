Jacksonville is a major military and civilian deep-water port located in Jacksonville, Florida. Its riverine location makes it an ideal location for two US Navy bases and the Port of Jacksonville, Florida's third largest seaport. The two US Navy bases, Blount Island Command and the nearby Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, form the third largest military presence in the United States.
