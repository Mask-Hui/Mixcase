The West Side of Fresno is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city, located southwest of the 99 freeway, west of the 41 freeway, and south of Nielsen Avenue (or the newly constructed 180 Freeway). It is traditionally considered to be the center of the African-American community in Fresno. The neighborhood is culturally diverse, and includes significant Mexican-American and Asian-American populations.
