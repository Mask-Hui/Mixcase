The civil disobedience performed at the test site was a protest against nuclear testing in Nevada. The Committee for Non-Violent Action sponsored a protest at the Camp Mercury nuclear test site near Las Vegas, Nevada in August 1957. Thirteen of the protesters attempted to enter the test site knowing that they faced arrest. At a pre-arranged time, one at a time they stepped across the "line" and were immediately arrested. They were taken to the Nye County seat of Tonoppa, Nevada and arraigned for trial before the local Justice of the Peace. A well-known civil rights attorney, Francis Hei√üler
