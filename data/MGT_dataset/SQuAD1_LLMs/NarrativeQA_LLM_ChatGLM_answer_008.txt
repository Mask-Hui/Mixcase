The goal of civil disobedience is to achieve social, political, or economic change through peaceful protests, disobedience, or other non-violent means. Going to jail as a form of civil disobedience may be used as a way to continue protests, remind society of injustice, and maintain the spirit of protest, but it is not necessarily the only or ultimate goal of civil disobedience.
