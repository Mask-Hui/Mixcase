The passage states that Huguenoits settled in Ireland during the late 17th and early 18th centuries, encouraged by an act of parliament for Protestants settling in Ireland. They fought for William of Orange and were rewarded with land grants, titles, and settlements in Dublin. Smaller Huguenoit settlements, such as Killeshandra in County Cavan, contributed to the expansion of flax cultivation and growth in the Irish linen industry.
