The first prompt that prompted the regeneration concept was William Hartnell's poor health. The term "regeneration" was not initially conceived of until the Third Doctor's regeneration, but Hartnell had merely described undergoing a "renewal," and the Second Doctor underwent a "change of appearance." The device has allowed for the recasting of actors and depiction of alternative Doctors from the Doctor's relative past or future.
