The historian Frederick W. Mote believes that the usage of the term'social classes' for the Yuan system of classes is misleading. Instead of the term'social classes', Mote suggests using 'Yuan classes' as a more appropriate term, since it truly represents the social power and wealth of the Chinese people, and people's actual social position within the classes is not determined by their class position but only by 'degrees of privilege' which they are entitled. So a person's class position within the Yuan classes does not guarantee that person's social standing. On the contrary, there are rich and well socially standing Chinese while there are less rich Mongol and Semu than there are Mongol and Semu who live in poverty. 

In summary, Mote agrees with the term'social classes', but believes that 'Yuan classes' is a more accurate term to use in describing the Yuan system of classes.
