The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple method to compute primes, although the large primes found today with computers are not generated this way. The Sieve separates the integers into 2 types of groups. The first group contains the primes and the second group contains the rest. Initially all the numbers in the list are considered to be prime. Next, any number is moved into the second group which contains all numbers other than the number. If the new number is also prime then it is removed from the list. The process is repeated until only one number remains in the first group. That number is the 'perfect' number that divides every number in the first group.
