The passage mentions that the notion of number is generally replaced with that of ideal, which is an important tool and object of study in commutative algebra, algebraic number theory, and algebraic geometry. Prime ideals, which generalize prime elements, are an important tool and object of study in commutative algebra, algebraic number theory, and algebraic geometry. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic generalizes to the Lasker-Noether theorem, which expresses every ideal in a Noetherian commutative ring as an intersection of primary ideals, which are the appropriate generalizations of prime powers.
