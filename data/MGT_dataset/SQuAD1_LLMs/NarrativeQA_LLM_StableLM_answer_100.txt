The passage is discussing the difficulty of solving a computational problem, specifically the difficulty of finding the minimum number of steps required to solve a computational problem. The passage mentions that the running time of a problem may depend on the size of the instance, and that larger instances may require more time to solve. The passage also mentions that complexity theory is interested in how algorithms scale with an increase in the input size, and that the complexity of an algorithm is usually measured by its running time in bits.
