Guo Shoujing applied mathematics to the construction of calendars and was one of the first mathematicians in China to work on spherical trigonometry. He derived a cubic interpolation formula for his astronomical calculations and his calendar, the Shoushi Li or Calendar for Fixing the Seasons, was disseminated in 1281 as the official calendar of the Yuan dynasty.
