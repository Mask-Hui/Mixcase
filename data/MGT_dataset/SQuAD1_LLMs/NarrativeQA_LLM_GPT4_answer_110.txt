The passage states that William Shirley assumed command of British forces in North America after the death of Braddock. He laid out his plans for the year in a meeting held on December 5, 1755. The plans included renewing the efforts to capture Niagara, Crown Point and Duquesn√©, as well as attacking Fort Frontenac on the north shore of Lake Ontario and an expedition through the wilderness to attack Quebec. However, these plans were met with disagreements and disputes from others, including William Johnson and New York's Governor Sir Charles Hardy.
