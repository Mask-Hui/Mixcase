The Musical Instruments gallery closed 25 February 2010, and items were redistribute to the British Galleries, the Medieval & Renaissance Galleries, and the planned new galleries for Furniture and Europe 1600â€“1800. The Horniman Museum and other institutions were possible candidates for loans of material to ensure that the instruments remained publicly viewable. The Horniman Museum went on to host a joint exhibition with the V&A of musical instruments, and has the loan of 35 instruments from the museum. Therefore, the Horniman Museum would receive items on loans from the Musical Instruments gallery.
