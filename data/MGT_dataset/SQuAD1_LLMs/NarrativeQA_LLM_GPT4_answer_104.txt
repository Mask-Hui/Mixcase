The IPCC Trust Fund was established in 1989 by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The scale of payments is determined by the IPCC Panel, which also considers and adopts by consensus the annual budget. The organization is required to comply with the Financial Regulations and Rules of the WMO.
