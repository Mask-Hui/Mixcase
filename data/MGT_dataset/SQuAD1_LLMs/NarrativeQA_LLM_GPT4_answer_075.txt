The passage states that the Scottish Parliament holds ordinary general elections on a first Thursday in May every four years. The date of the poll may be varied by up to one month either way, and the Parliament may be dissolved by a royal proclamation if it fails to nominate one of its members as First Minister within 28 days. Extraordinary general elections are held in addition to ordinary general elections, unless they are held less than six months before the due date of an ordinary general election, in which case they supplant it. The following ordinary general election will revert to the first Thursday in May, a multiple of four years after 1999.
