The passage states that there are eight rows of comb-like structures located near the mouth and spaced evenly around the body. The comb-like structures beat in a metachronal rhythm similar to that of a Mexican wave. The passage also mentions the existence of a mechanical system for transmitting beat rhythm from the comb-like structures to balancers via water disturbances created by the cilia.
