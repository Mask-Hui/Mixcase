The RJS BDR men materialised in Cardiff in 2005, with the first series featuring Christopher Eccleston as the Eighth Doctor. 

An unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production was made in 1996 with a television film, called The Shakespeare County Cake Crisis, which featured Phil Morris and Karen Gillan, and ran for one episode.
