Guo Shoujing was one of the first mathematicians in China to work on spherical trigonometry, which he used to construct calendars. His calendar for fixing the seasons, known as Shoushi Li or Calendar for Fixing the Seasons, was disseminated in 1281 as an official calendar of the Yuan dynasty. The Shoushi Li may have been influenced by the work of Song dynasty astronomer Shen Kuo or possibly by the work of Arab astronomers. There are no explicit signs of Muslim influences in the Shoushi calendar, but Mongol rulers were known to be interested in Muslim calendars.
