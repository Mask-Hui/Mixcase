Pharmacy technicians were formerly limited to assisting pharmacists in the dispensing of medications within a dispensary. They were responsible for maintaining the pharmacy's inventory, ensuring that medications were stored and labeled correctly. They also assisted pharmacists in preparing prescriptions and communicating with patients about their medications. However, as pharmacy technicians have become more reliant on automation to assist them in their new role, they have also become more responsible for patient safety issues.
