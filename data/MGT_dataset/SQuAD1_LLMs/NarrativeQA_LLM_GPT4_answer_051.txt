China's investment in Kenya has been significant, with a total of $474 million in 2012. This represents Kenya's largest source of foreign direct investment and bilateral trade with China. The Chinese ambassador's comments suggest that the investment was aimed at supporting a planned $2.5 billion railway from the southern Kenyan port of Mombasa to neighboring Uganda, as well as a nearly $1.8 billion dam project in Kenya, which were both announced during President Kenyatta's 2013 trip to Beijing. China has also been causing environmental and social problems, including the suspension of a railway project.
