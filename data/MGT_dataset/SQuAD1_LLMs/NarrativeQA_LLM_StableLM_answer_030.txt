Based on the provided passage, it can be concluded that the concept of intractability in problem solving is open to debate. While the passage does not explicitly state that all large cases of the problem are hard or even that most of them are, it does provide examples of problems that are difficult or impossible to solve in reasonable times, and a variety of algorithms that have been shown to solve the problem in reasonable times. Additionally, the passage mentions that algorithms can solve the NP-complete Boolean satisfiability problem over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time, and that SAT solvers routinely handle large instances of the problem. Therefore,
