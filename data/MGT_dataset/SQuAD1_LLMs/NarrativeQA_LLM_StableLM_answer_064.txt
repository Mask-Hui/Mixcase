The passage describes the evolutionary relationships between ctenophores and other phyla, including bilaterians and cnidarians. The last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippid-like or beroid-like, and the genetic differences between these species were very small. This suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent, and perhaps was lucky enough to survive the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event 65.5 million years ago while other lineages perished. The analysis was broadened to include representatives of other phyla, and concluded that cnidarians are probably more closely
