The biodiversity of plant species is the highest on Earth. One 2001 study found a quarter kilometer of Ecuadorian rainforest supports more than 1,100 tree species. A study in 1999 found one hectare of Amazon rainforest contains about 90,790 tonnes of living plants. To date, approximately 438,000 species of plants of economic and social interest have been registered in the region with many more remaining to be discovered or catalogued. The total number of tree species in the region is estimated at 16,000. One hectare of Amazon rainforest contains about 35 pounds of living plants.
