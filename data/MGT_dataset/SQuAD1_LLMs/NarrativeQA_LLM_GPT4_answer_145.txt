Luther believed that justification was entirely the work of God, and he based his position on the teachings of St. Paul in Romans 3:24-28, where justification is described as a gift from God. Luther wrote that justification comes not only through faith in Christ, but also from the experience of being justified by faith. He also believed that justification was a discovery about "the righteousness of God," which the just person lives by faith.
