Luther feared to cause himself and his family the pain of a life without celibacy. He had written to George Spaalatin on 30 November 1524, "I shall never take a wife as I feel at present. Not that I am insensible to my flesh or sex (for I am neither wood nor stone); but my mind is averted to wedlock because I daily expect the death of a heretic."
