The passage describes the history of the Roman Empire from the death of Augustus in AD 14 until after AD 70. The empire initially accepted the Rhine as its Germanic frontier, but later held only the fertile plain of Frankfurt, the southernmost slopes of the Black Forest, and scattered bridge-heads. The northern section of the frontier was different, and the upper Rhine and upper Danube were easily crossed, making it convenient for the Romans to drift through the Rhine.
