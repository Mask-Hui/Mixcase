The passage is from the book, "The Age of Mechanical Reproduction" by Isabelle Bowen. The passage reads: "It was, of course, possible for Tesla to marry, as he had been married to a beautiful woman, but he preferred to stay single. He was a man of science, and he believed that it was his duty to dedicate himself to his work. And so, he did." The question is: "When did Tesla admit to a reporter that maybe he'd sacrificed too much by not having a relationship?"
