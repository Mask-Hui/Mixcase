The passage states that Peyton Manning became the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams (the Broncos and the Indianapolis Colts) to multiple Super Bowls. He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39. The past record was held by John Elway, who led the Broncos to victory in Super Bowl XXXII at age 38 and is currently Denver's Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager. Therefore, the answer to the question is John Elway.
