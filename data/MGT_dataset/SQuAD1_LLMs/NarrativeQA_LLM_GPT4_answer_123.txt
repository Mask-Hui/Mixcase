The passage states that free oxygen also occurs in solution at lower temperatures, which has important implications for ocean life. The increased solubility of oxygen at lower temperatures is due to the physical properties of water, such as its temperature and pressure. The passage also mentions that water polluted with plant nutrients may stimulate the growth of algae, which can reduce oxygen levels in eutrophic water bodies. The question asks about the temperature at which oxygen is more soluble.
