The patient-doctor relationship is defined by the laws and regulations of each individual state. In some states, a patient-doctor relationship is established when the doctor and patient have a direct, personal relationship. In other states, the patient-doctor relationship is established when a licensed practitioner acts in the course of their legitimate practice. The laws and regulations governing the patient-doctor relationship vary by state, and it is important for individuals to consult with their state's licensing board or attorney for guidance on establishing a valid patient-doctor relationship.
