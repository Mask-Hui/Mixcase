There was a depreciation of the industrialized nations dollars because the United States unilaterally pulled out of the Bretton Woods Accord and abandoned the Gold Exchange Standard, allowing the value of the dollar to "float" according to market demand. The industrialized nations increased their reserves by expanding their money supplies, leading to a depreciation of the dollar and other currencies. Because oil was priced in dollars, oil producers' real income decreased. In September 1971, OPEC issued a joint communiqu√© stating that, from then on, they would price oil in terms of a fixed amount of gold.
