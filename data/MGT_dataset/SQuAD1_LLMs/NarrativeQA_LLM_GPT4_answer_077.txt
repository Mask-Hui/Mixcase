The extinction event that might have created some conditions allowing the expansion of the Amazon rainforest was the Cretaceous-Palaeogene extinction event. This event occurred approximately 66-34 million years ago and is believed to have wiped out the dinosaurs, which were major predators in the region. The extinction event may have allowed for a shift in climate patterns, which could have led to the expansion of tropical rainforests across South America. This event is believed to have created the conditions necessary for the survival and evolution of a diverse range of species, including the Amazon rainforest.
