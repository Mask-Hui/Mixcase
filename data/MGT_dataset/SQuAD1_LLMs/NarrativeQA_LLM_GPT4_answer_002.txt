Structural geologists use microscopic analysis of oriented thin sections of geological samples to observe the fabric within rocks, which gives information about strain and deformation within the crystalline structure of rocks. They also plot and combine measurements to better understand the orientation of faults, folds and reconstruct rock deformation history in the area.
