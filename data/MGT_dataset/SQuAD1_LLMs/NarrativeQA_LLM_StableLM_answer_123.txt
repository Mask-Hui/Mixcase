The passage discusses the concept of inertia and how it can be applied to the understanding of motion in general. It notes that the rotational inertia of Earth is what causes the length of a day and a year to remain constant. The principle of equivalence between inertial reference frames and reference frames subject to constant acceleration was one of the foundational ideas in Einstein's theory of general relativity. The passage also briefly touches on the idea of how inertia can be generalized to explain the tendency of objects to continue in many different forms of constant motion, even those that are not strictly constant velocity.
