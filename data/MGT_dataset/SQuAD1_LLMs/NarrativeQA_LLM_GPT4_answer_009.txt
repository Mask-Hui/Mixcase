The passage states that Genghis Khan had three more sons, ChaGatai (1187-124), Ögedei (1189-124) and Toluai (1190-123), but no information is given about the number or names of their daughters. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the question about which male child of Ghengi Khan and Bört was born last.
