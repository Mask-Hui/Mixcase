The Apollo spacecraft used a "Command Module" to carry the astronauts to Low Earth Orbit (LEO), and a "Service Module" to protect them on their journey and ensure their safety during breaks in lunar orbit. Both the Command Module and Service Module were powered by an Earth-orbiting command module engine. This staged both Module engines to provide electrical power during the descent through the atmosphere, and used the service module's jet engine to counteract the force of reentry. The Lunar Module used only the retrorockets provided by the command module.
