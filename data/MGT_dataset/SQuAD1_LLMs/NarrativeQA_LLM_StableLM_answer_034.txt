The Amazon rainforest was not a part of the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event. The Amazon rainforest was not affected by the extinction of the dinosaurs and the climate fluctuations that allowed the rainforest to expand to the south during the Cretaceous period. The rainforest was already thriving during the glacial periods, which allowed for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species.
