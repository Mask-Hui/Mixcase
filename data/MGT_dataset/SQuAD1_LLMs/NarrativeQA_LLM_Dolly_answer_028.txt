Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index (CPI) measures the prevalence of public sector corruption in various countries. In 2012, the nation of Kenya ranked 139th out of 176 total countries in the CPI, with a score of 27/100. However, there are several rather significant developments with regards to curbing corruption from the Kenyan government, for instance, the establishment of a new and independent Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC).
