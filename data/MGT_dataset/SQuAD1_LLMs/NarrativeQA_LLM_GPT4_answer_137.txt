The passage states that ctenophoras are the largest animals that swim by means of cilia. They are the largest animals that swim by means of cilia, and their bodies consist of a mass of jelly with two layers on the outside and another lining the internal cavity. They are two cells deep in ctenophoras, while those in cnidaarians are only one cell deep. Some authors combined ctenophoras and cnidaarians in one phylum, Coeletera.
