Guo Shoujing is an important figure in the history of Chinese astronomy and mathematics. He is considered one of the first mathematicians in China to work on spherical trigonometry, and he derived a cubic interpolation formula for his astronomical calculations. He also made important contributions to the study of the calendar, including the development of the Shoushi Li or Calendar for Fixing the Seasons.

One of the most significant aspects of Guo Shoujing's work is his use of mathematical knowledge from the Middle East to China. He was interested in the work of Arab astronomers, and he may have also been
