The Supreme Court of the United States interprets the First Amendment to the United States Constitution to prohibit the government of the United States from establishing a church. The court has read the amendment to apply to laws that designate churches for financial assistance from the government or that compel members of the church to subscribe to a particular point of view. Because most public schools are religious, they cannot qualify for government funding. Private schools that wish to receive public funding do so only through chartering with the public school district or through a governmental financial assistance program such as Title I, among others.
