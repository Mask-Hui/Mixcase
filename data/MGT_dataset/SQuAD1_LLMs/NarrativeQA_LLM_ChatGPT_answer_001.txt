According to the passage, the Aare more than doubles the Rhine's water discharge, providing an average of nearly 1,000 m3/s (35,000 cu ft/s), which is more than a fifth of the discharge at the Dutch border. Therefore, the answer to the question is that the Aare gives nearly 1,000 m3/s (35,000 cu ft/s) of water to the Rhine.
