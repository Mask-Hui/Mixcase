Scientists were able to liquefy air by compressing and cooling it. Swiss chemist and physicist Raouil Pierre Pictet used a cascade method to evaporate liquid sulfur dioxide in order to liquefy carbon dioxide, which was then evaporated to cool oxygen gas enough to liquefy it. French physicist Louis Paul Caill√©tet also announced his own method of liquefying molecular oxygen.
