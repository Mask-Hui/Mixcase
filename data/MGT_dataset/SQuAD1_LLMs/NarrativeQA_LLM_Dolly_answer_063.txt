Liu Guangyuan's passage talks about the relationship between China and Kenya and specifically mentions that China invested $474 million into Kenya. The total value of the bilateral trade between the two countries is mentioned too. This clearly shows that there is a great relationship between the two countries and that China invests into Kenya. Therefore, it means a lot for China to invest in Kenya because of the relationship between the two countries.
