The passage mentions that Buyantu Khan (Ayubaaqta) was a competent emperor who actively supported and adopted mainstream Chinese culture. He made many reforms, including the liquidation of the Department of State Affairs (Chinese:), which resulted in the execution of five of the highest-ranking officials. He also reintroduced traditional imperial examinations for prospective officials, testing their knowledge on significant historical works. Additionally, he codified much of the law and published or translated a number of Chinese books.
