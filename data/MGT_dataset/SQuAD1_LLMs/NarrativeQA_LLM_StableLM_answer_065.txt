The marginal utility of wealth per person is not a fixed value as it varies with the wealth of a person. In a society with more equality, the marginal utility of wealth per person will also be higher because the additional dollar spent by a wealthy person will go to things like basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare, while an additional dollar spent by a poor person will go to luxury items providing relatively less utility to that person. However, it is important to note that this analysis is based on a particular societal context and does not necessarily reflect the general relationship between wealth and happiness.
