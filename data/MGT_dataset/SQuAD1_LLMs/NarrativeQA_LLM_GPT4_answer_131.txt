The value of a worker is determined by the law of supply and demand. The price of a skilled worker's labor is determined by the race between their demand for skilled workers and supply of skilled workers. Employers who offer below market wages will find that their business is chronically undersupplied, while competitors offer higher wages to attract skilled workers. For a businessman with the profit motive as their prime interest, offering below or above market wages to workers is a losing proposition.
