Chloroplasts have their own ribosomes, which they use to synthesize a small fraction of their proteins. Chloroplasts ribosomes are about two-thirds the size of cytoplasmic ribosomes (around 17 nm vs 25 nm). They take mRNA transcribed from chloroplasts DNA and translate them into protein. While similar to bacterial ribosomes, chloroplasts translation is more complex than in bacteria, so chloroplasts ribosomes include some unique features. Small subunit ribosomal RNA in several Chlorophyta and Euglena chloroplasts lack motifs for
