There are several catalysts that can be used to produce oxygen, including:- Platinum or palladium catalysts, which can be used to oxidize carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are major pollutants in the atmosphere.- Copper catalysts, which can be used to oxidize carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), as well as to oxidize sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides.- Iron catalysts, which can be used to oxidize carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides.- Titanium dioxide (
