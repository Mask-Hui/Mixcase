You need to return me your answer. The answer is 'one out of six produced leaves the cycle'. This comes from the passage 'The Calvin cycle starts by using the enzyme Rubisco to fix CO2 into five-carbon Ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) molecules. The result is unstable six-carbon molecules that immediately break down into three-carbon molecules called 3-phosphoglyceric acid, or 3-PGA'. The 6-carbon molecule produced by Rubisco can form 3-PGA molecule through phosphoglycerate synthase. However, the 3-PGA formed is unstable and breaks down into three-carbon molecules called 3-PGA. In other words, 3-PGA does not persist in the Calvin cycle. So, only one out of every six produced leaves the cycleâ€”the end product of the dark reactions.
