The passage is about Tesla, a philosopher and electrical engineer, who was a proponent of an "imposed selective breeding version of eugenics" in the early 20th century. He believed that humans' "pity" had interfered with the natural "ruthless workings of nature," rather than from conceptions of a "master race" or inherent superiority of one person over another. The passage also notes that he had advocated for this view further.
