The complexity of problems often depends on what?The answer to the question "What is a problem?" can be found in the passage provided. The complexity of a problem is determined by the class in which it belongs. The passage states that a problem is considered complex if it belongs to the NP class, which is a subset of P. The NP class includes problems that can be solved in polynomial time, while the P class includes problems that can be solved in polynomial time. Therefore, the complexity of a problem depends on its class.
