The passage states that the Calvin cycle starts by using Rubisco to fix CO2 into RuBP molecules, which are unstable and break down into 3-PGA. The ATP and NADPH made in the light reactions are used to convert 3-PGA into G3P sugar molecules. Most of the G3P molecules are recycled back into RuBP using energy from more ATP, but one out of every six produced leaves the cycle.
