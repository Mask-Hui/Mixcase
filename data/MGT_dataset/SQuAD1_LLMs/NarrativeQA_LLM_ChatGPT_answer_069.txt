According to the passage, giving a defiant speech during allocution could be more harmful for the individual because it could suggest a lack of remorse and an attempt to avoid responsibility for their actions, which could lead to an increase in sentence length or other negative consequences. In the example provided, the defendant's argument that the Navy was violating a greater law was seen as a lack of remorse and resulted in an increase in her sentence.
