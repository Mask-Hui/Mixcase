The passage states that the IJssel branch carries one ninth of the water flow from the Rhine north into a former bay, while the Nedeerrijn carries approximately two ninths of the flow west along a route parallel to the Waal. At Wijk bij Duuursstede, the Nedeerrijn changes its name and becomes the Lek, which flows farther west to join the Noord River and eventually flows into the North Sea. Therefore, Ijssel carries approximately one ninth of the Rhine flow.
