It is not possible for a single location to rain all the time. Rainfall is the result of different processes such as evaporation, condensation, and transpiration. These processes occur in different parts of the world at different times of the year. The amount and intensity of rain vary from region to region. Some regions receive more rain than others, but the amount and frequency of rain in any given location depends on many complex factors such as temperature, humidity, and topography.
