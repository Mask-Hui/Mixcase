If you place a mirror by your bed, it will reflect the light from outside and make your room look brighter. This can be helpful if you wake up in the middle of a dark night and need some extra light. However, if you are sensitive to bright lights or have trouble sleeping, placing a mirror by your bed may not be the best idea. It's always a good practice to consult with your doctor or sleep specialist before making any changes to the environment around your bed.
