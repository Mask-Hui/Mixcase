The trails left in the sky by aircraft are called contrails, and they are composed of water vapor that condenses into tiny ice crystals. Contrails form in the very cold upper atmosphere, typically at high altitudes where the air temperature is below -40Â°C. The ice crystals in contrails can persist for several hours and spread out, forming distinctive cloud formations. Some aircraft also emit other particles, such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides, but these particles do not play a significant role in contrail formation.
