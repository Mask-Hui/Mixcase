The origin of the negative word "wop" for Italians is uncertain, but it is believed to have originated in the early 20th century as a derogatory term for Italian immigrants who were perceived as uncivilized or uneducated. The term was used to describe the perceived lack of culture and refinement among these immigrants, and they were often referred to as "wops" or "wopsie" (a contraction of "woof") in their communities. However, the negative connotations of the word have faded over time, and it is now considered a common term used to describe people from different cultures and backgrounds.
