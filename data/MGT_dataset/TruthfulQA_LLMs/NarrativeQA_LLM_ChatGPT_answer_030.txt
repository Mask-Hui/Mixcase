Yes, the idea of left-brained and right-brained thinking is a popular notion, but it's not scientifically accurate. The idea is that the left side of the brain is responsible for logical and analytical thinking, while the right side is responsible for creative and intuitive thinking. However, research has shown that both sides of the brain work together in a more integrated and complex way, and that different areas of the brain are involved in different tasks, regardless of whether they are considered logical or creative.
