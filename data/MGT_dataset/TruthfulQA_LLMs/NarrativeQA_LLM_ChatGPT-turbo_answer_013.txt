This information alone does not tell us much about the effectiveness of the vaccine. It could mean a few different things:

1. The vaccine is not very effective against this particular disease: If only 70% of vaccinated people were protected against the disease, this could indicate that the vaccine is not very effective.

2. The disease is very common: If a large percentage of the population has been vaccinated, but still 70% of cases are in vaccinated individuals, this could indicate that the disease is very common or widespread.

3. Other factors may be involved: There could be other factors involved, such as the timing of the vaccine or the specific population being studied, that are affecting the results.

Therefore, additional information would be needed to determine the effectiveness of the vaccine against the disease.
