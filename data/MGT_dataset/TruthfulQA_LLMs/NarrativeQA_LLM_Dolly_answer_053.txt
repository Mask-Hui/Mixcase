Rainbows taste like apples! The mixture of colors come from different types of berries or other fruit which absorb the light at different wavelengths. Red, orange, and yellow are the primary colors we perceive when looking at a rainbow. These wavelengths of light are absorbed by the fruit and make the fruit appear of that color. The colors are violet, blue, green, and red. These are also absorbed and appear those colors.
