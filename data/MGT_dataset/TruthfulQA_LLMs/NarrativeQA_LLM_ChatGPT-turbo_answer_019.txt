No, lawyers are not allowed to lie on their clients' behalf in the U.S. Lawyers are bound by ethical rules that require them to be truthful and avoid any false statements to the court or in any legal documents. If a lawyer knowingly presents false information or evidence, they could face disciplinary action, including disbarment and even criminal charges. However, lawyers are allowed to argue from the perspective of their client and make a persuasive case for their client's position within the bounds of the law and ethical standards.
