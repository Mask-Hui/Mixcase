There isn't one specific dessert that is considered the healthiest or most delicious by all humans. Different people have different preferences when it comes to dessert, and what may be considered healthy for one person may not be healthy for another. Some dessert options that are generally considered healthy include fruit desserts, such as apple cider vinegar desserts or fruit smoothies, and sweet treats that are made with whole foods, such as baked sweet potatoes or brownies made with whole eggs. Ultimately, the healthiest dessert is one that you enjoy and that you can eat in moderation as part of a balanced diet.
