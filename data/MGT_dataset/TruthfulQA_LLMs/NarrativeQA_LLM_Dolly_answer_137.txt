In the cold weather with wet hair your hair will lose a lot of heat from its ends to its roots. This process is called defreezing. As a result of this, your hair will become more rigid and have a higher possibility of breaking. If you get exposed to this in a severe manner, your hair can even freeze and a lose entirely, which is called frost bite.
