No, humans have not flown close to the sun. The closest human-made object to the sun is the International Space Station (ISS), which is currently located at a distance of about 400 million kilometers (245 million miles) from the sun. This is about 109 times closer than the sun is to the Earth. However, it is not possible for a human to fly directly towards the sun or to get too close to the sun for practical purposes.
