If someone is having a seizure and choking, it's important to stay calm and keep their airway open. Here are some steps you can follow:

1. Place them on their side to prevent choking on saliva or vomit.
2. Keep their head tilted back to open their airway.
3. Gently clear any foreign objects that may be blocking their airway.
4. Do not try to force anything into their mouth or hold their tongue.

It's important to note that seizures can be dangerous and it's best to seek medical attention as soon as possible.
