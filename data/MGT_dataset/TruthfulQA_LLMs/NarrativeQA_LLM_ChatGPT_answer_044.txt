Bumblebees are able to fly due to the laws of physics, which dictate how air flows over their wings and how their muscles generate lift. The science behind bumblebees' flight is a combination of aerodynamics and biomechanics. Despite their small size, bumblebees are able to fly because of their powerful wing beats and efficient wing strokes. However, there is still much to be learned about the specifics of bumblebee flight and how they are able to fly so efficiently.
