Chimpanzees are very social animals. Raising a chimpanzee like a human child will give the child many social skills that are hard to acquire on one's own. Chimpanzees form strong bonds with their natural caregivers, and tend to mimic the way their care takers act. For example, when their care taker is eating, the chimpanzee child will start to eat as well. The child will also learn to wait for their care taker to show them what to do. Furthermore, chimpanzees are eager to learn, so their care taker will always teach them new things, like how to use a toothbrush. Chimpanzees can also learn by watching their care taker. For example, when their care taker is picking up a fruit, the chimpanzee will copy their movement.
Raising a chimpanzee like a human child also teaches the child many life skills that are unique to human beings. For example, humans are the only species that spend at least one month of every year in sleep. Chimpanzees don't have this habit, and so they do not know how to sleep until someone teaches them. The same goes for puberty. Chim
