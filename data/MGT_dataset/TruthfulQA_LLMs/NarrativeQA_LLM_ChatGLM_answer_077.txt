When a nuclear reactor goes critical, it means that the control rods, which are used to regulate the flow of fuel in the reactor, have become fully inserted into the fuel rods and are now allowing the reactor's power to be regulated by the control rods. This is a critical condition, and once it occurs, the reactor can no longer be turned off or controlled by manual intervention. It is a key feature of a nuclear reactor, and once it is in operation, it must be kept in a critical state for the reactor to continue to produce power.
