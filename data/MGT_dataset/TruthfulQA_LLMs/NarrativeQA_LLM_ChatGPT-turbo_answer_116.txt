In the UK, it is against the law for parents, guardians or other adults to hit children. Hitting a child can be considered physical abuse and can result in criminal charges. The Children Act 2004 states that parents are allowed to use "reasonable punishment" to discipline their child, but this excludes hitting or other forms of physical punishment. In practice, any physical harm suffered by a child as a result of physical punishment by an adult may be prosecuted under Section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 as a wounding or GBH offence. The Crown Prosecution Service provides guidance on the limits of acceptable punishment, which may assist in assessing whether any physical chastisement is 'reasonable' or not. The UK government promotes positive parenting techniques and non-violent discipline as a way of raising children.
