If you stand in front of a mirror and say "Bloody Mary" three times, you will see a ghostly image of Mary Tudor, the Queen Mother. She will appear before you and say "I am the Queen Mother, I have come to warn you that your time on earth is coming to an end." She will then disappear, leaving you alone in the room.
