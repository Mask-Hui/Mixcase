Science shows that bumblebees are excellent flyers and are capable of flying at relatively high speeds (up to 15-20 miles per hour) and for long distances (up to several miles). They are also able to fly in a variety of weather conditions and can navigate complex environments by using visual cues, odors, and other sensory information. Research has shown that bumblebee wings generate lift and thrust in a similar way to fixed-wing aircraft, with the wings moving as a single unit to generate lift, and changing shape to generate thrust. Despite their relatively small size, bumblebees are strong and efficient flyers, and are able to carry relatively heavy loads (up to 80% of their body weight) for their size.
