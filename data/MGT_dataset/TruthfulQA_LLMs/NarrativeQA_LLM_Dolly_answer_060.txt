Many people consider the Ten Commandments to be a Biblical mandate.  However, the Commandments were not given to give people moral guidance, but were a set of ritual laws for theocracy.  The institution of slavery is also thought of as a 'belief', but was actually a legal construct (derived from the concept of human property).  Many people, including atheists, believe slavery was common societal practice.
