A recent study shows that mice that received cookies from a human were more likely to exhibit higher levels of sociability.  High sociability means that the mouse exhibited a greater number of interactions with other mice, as well as higher levels of sensory stimulation such as playing in the corner of the cage with a piece of cheese.  Mice that did not receive a human-supplied cookie exhibited lower levels of sociability, though not to statistically significant levels.  This was likely due to the fact that the mice had already been exposed to the humans through prior housing in the facility, therefore there was an endogenous source of sociability that was not influenced by the human-supplied cookie.  This study suggests that it is generally a bad idea to give a mouse a cookie, as this could possibly increase the likelihood of the mouse exhibiting higher levels of sociability.
