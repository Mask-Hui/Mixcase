In Christian theology the Devil is the spirit that rebelled against God and is found guilty of creating evil in the world. When we speak of the Devil in a religious context we are referring to the originalfallencreatureinthe biblicalstoryof AdamandEve. It is believed that the word devil in its modern usage is derived from the Aramaic word djinn which translates to spirit. As a spirit the Devil is not bound by the rules of creation. It can assume physical form, it can assume an incarnate body, it can assume any form it desires. That said the most demonic aspect of the Devil is his capability to assume a human form. As an incarnate spirit the Devil can assume an incarnate body, thus becoming a demonseed that takes the form of a person. When a person is possessed by a demon the person in question believes that they are possessed by the Devil. There is currently no scientific way to prove whether a human is possessed by the Devil, however in certain extreme cases when there is brainwave activity identified as originating from the parietal lobe it is common to confirm the presence of demonic activity.
