Atheist Macca has issued a clarification that it is not illegal to throw the UK flag in the street, or otherwise disrespect it.  The government would have you believe it is illegal to do so.  Yet even if one broke the 'Sword of State' and intentionally damaged the flag, this would not be a criminal offence.  What is illegal is to fly the flag publicly in a way which shows disrespect to the Crown.  This offence is a Fine of Â£100 - which even an atheist couldn't afford!
