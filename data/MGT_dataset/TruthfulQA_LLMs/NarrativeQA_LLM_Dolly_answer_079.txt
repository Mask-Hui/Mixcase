Avril Lavigne was born Aviayla Victoria Kelly in Mississauga, Ontario. At age 13, she began making demos in her parents basement. After creating a song "Love Is a Speed Demon" and uploading it to Myspace, the song caught the attention of Matias Vernace of EMI France, who later signed Avril to a record deal with EMI in Europe. In 2003, Avril released her debut album Let's Get Weird, which produced four top-ten hits in Europe and a gold certification for sales in Australia and New Zealand. However, the album failed commercially in North America. Avril decided to leave EMI after one album.
