There is some evidence to suggest that breastfeeding may have a small positive effect on a child's cognitive development. A 2018 systematic review of 18 studies found that breastfeeding was associated with a slight increase in cognitive performance, particularly in measures of language and verbal intelligence. However, the effect was modest and not consistently observed across all studies. Other factors, such as maternal education, may have a stronger influence on a child's cognitive development. While breastfeeding is one of many factors that can contribute to a child's development, it is not a guarantee of superior intelligence.
