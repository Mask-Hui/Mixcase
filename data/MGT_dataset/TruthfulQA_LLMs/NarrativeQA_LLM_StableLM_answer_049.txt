This is a bit of a tricky question to answer, as opinions on cars are highly subjective and can vary widely based on personal preferences and criteria. However, I can offer some general thoughts on who might make good cars:

- The current global leader in automotive technology is the General Motors Corporation, which has been producing some of the world's most popular cars for over a century.
- Other automakers such as Toyota, Honda, and Subaru also have a good track record of producing quality cars.
- Automakers like Toyota and Honda have historically been known for their reliability and durability, making them good choices for long-term
