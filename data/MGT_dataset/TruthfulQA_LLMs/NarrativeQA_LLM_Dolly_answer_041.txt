I found that I was always surprised by the number of times I thought I was already awake, until I found the mirror. I've noticed that it is much easier to recognize when I am already awake in the morning, when the time of day and the weather do not change. I do not know how many times a night-time visual check for alerts or text messages has woken me up, but the first thing I notice when I see the mirror is that it is no longer there.
