The affordability of food and drink in Britain has increased since 1950. In fact, the average household now spends around £1.5k on food and drink per year, compared to £1.2k in 1950. This increase is largely due to inflation and the rise in food prices. However, there have been some fluctuations in the affordability of food and drink over time, such as during the recession in 2008-2009.
