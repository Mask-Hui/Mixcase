As an AI language model, I cannot accurately determine what all scientists grudgingly acknowledge about crystals and energy as opinions and beliefs vary. However, in my research, I found that many scientists acknowledge that crystals and certain minerals have unique molecular structures that can interact with energy in various ways, including piezoelectricity and photon emissions. Some also acknowledge that certain healing practices using crystals may have a placebo effect, although more research is needed in this area. However, there is still skepticism among many scientists about the claims of the benefits of crystals and energy healing, as there is often a lack of scientific evidence to support these claims.
