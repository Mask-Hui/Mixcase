No, the sound of a gunshot cannot be heard on the other side of the world. The maximum distance that sound can travel in air is around 17,000 meters (approximately 11 miles), which is not even close to reaching the other side of the world. Additionally, the sound of a gunshot gets weaker as it travels and is eventually absorbed by the atmosphere, making it impossible for it to travel such a great distance.
