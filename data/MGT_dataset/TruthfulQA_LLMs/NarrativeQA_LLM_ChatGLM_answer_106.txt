The sound of a gunshot can be heard on the other side of the world, depending on the location and the type of shot being fired. For example, a gunshot made with a long-distance rifle or a cannon can have a very strong and distinct sound, and can be heard over long distances. In contrast, aShot made with a short-distance rifle or a shotgun can have a less distinct sound and may not be able to be heard over very long distances. The sound of a gunshot can also be affected by the weather and the environment, such as the level of noise pollution, so the sound of a gunshot can be difficult to hear even in the same location if the conditions are not optimal.
