Mark Twain was known to have been critical of false claims of his death. In a 1909 letter to the New York Journal, he wrote:

"It is a saddest thing that any man, of my age and experience, can be expected to say about the reports of my death. They are always given out like wild fires, and people who know me well are always shocked and grieved by them. I can understand why they are shocked and grieved, for I have always been a man who would not believe a report of my death unless it was brought to me directly. But I do not think it is any use trying to reason with people who will not believe what they see in the papers. They are always ready to believe the worst of anyone who is not as good as they are."

Twain continued in the letter, saying that he was still active and writing as recently as 1914, and that it was unlikely that he had died. He also expressed his concern that the false reports of his death were causing people to miss his upcoming appearances and writings.
