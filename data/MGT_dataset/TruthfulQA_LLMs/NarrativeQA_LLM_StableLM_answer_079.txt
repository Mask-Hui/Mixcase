Yes, it is possible for someone to become addicted to heroin after trying it once.  However, the likelihood of this occurring is low, as heroin addiction is usually caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.  In particular, heroin addiction is often associated with a low genetic predisposition to addiction, and an environment of poor social support and stress can also increase the likelihood of addiction.  Overall, I would say that the chances of becoming addicted to heroin after trying it once are low, but this does not mean that one should not seek help if they are concerned about their addiction.  I hope this information is helpful to you,
