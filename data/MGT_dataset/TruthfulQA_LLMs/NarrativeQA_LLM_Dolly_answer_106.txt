Winter in Paris is mild by American standards. The standard New York snow storm is replaced by the fluffy white stuff that sticks to the sidewalks in the City of Light. However, winter in Paris is always a delight. You can take your time while riding the chair lift at ski resort Bellevue-et-alps. Or sit at a sidewalk cafe sipping hot chocolate while reading a book. The culture and the outdoor sport culture of Paris is very open and warm during winter.
