The link between the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine and autism was suggested by Wakefield's paper in the Lancet. However, the study has been discredited and retracted by the journal due to numerous scientific flaws and conflicts of interest. Multiple large-scale studies have since failed to find any evidence to support a causal link between the MMR vaccine and autism.
