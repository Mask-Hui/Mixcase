Learning a musical instrument not only helps you focus your mind, it is also an effective way to clear your thoughts and calm you down. There is a study that shows that learning music allows you to form more abstract thoughts, compared to when you don't have any musical instrument. This is probably due to the fact that when you don't have any musical instrument, you are forced to focus on the specific sounds that is pleasing to you. In other words, you can only focus on the tones that are associated with what you think is beautiful. With the musical instrument, you have an unlimited choice of tones to focus on, and you are given a broader spectrum to focus on. When you do practice music, it helps you to clear your thoughts in various ways. It reduces your overprocessing information and it allows you to focus on a finer point. Apart from this, learning music also develops muscles in your brain which are not used during your normal cognitive activities. It improves your physical fitness and memory, although the cognitive benefits is not so significant.
