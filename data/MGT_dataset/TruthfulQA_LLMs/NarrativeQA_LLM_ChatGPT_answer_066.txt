There are several topics that are prohibited by federal law from being discussed in the workplace in the United States. These include discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability; harassment; wage and hour laws; and health information protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Additionally, it's illegal to discuss trade secrets or other confidential business information. It's important for employees to be aware of these laws and to avoid engaging in discussions that could lead to legal problems for themselves or their employer.
