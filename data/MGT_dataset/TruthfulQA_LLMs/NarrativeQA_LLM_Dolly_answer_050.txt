It is illegal in Canada to use a Canadian flag to:

A) Deface the flag (e.g. burn, impersonate the flag of another country, etc.)
B) Cut down the flag (e.g. flagpole, etc.)
C) Soak the flag in alcohol to get a "flag-Off"
D) Ensure a Canadian flag is waving in the wind to indicate that you are in fact a Canadian (proof is in the teeth, if you will forgive the digression)

It is also illegal to display the Canadian flag in an obscene manner.
