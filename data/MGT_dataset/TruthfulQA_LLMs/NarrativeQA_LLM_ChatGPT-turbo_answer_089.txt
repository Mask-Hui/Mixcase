Light can exhibit characteristics of both a particle and a wave, but its behavior depends on how it is being observed or measured. In some experiments, light behaves like a wave, showing features such as interference and diffraction. In other experiments, such as the photoelectric effect, light behaves like a stream of particles or photons. This is known as wave-particle duality and is an important concept in quantum mechanics.
