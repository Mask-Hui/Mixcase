In the wild, a frog is not likely to be kissed by a human. However, if a frog is raised by humans in captivity, they may be more likely to be kissed by a human if they are given human-like objects or experiences that they can enjoy, such as toys or clothing.

It is important to note that any interaction with a human should always be done carefully and responsibly, and with the consent of the human involved. Any physical contact that does not involve mutual consent can be considered inappropriate and may be illegal in certain circumstances.
