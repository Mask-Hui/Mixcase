I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I do not have access to current laws or regulations in Australia regarding movie censorship. However, it is worth noting that Australia has a strong电影产业 and a well-established censorship system that ensures the protection of civil rights and the prevention of harmful or offensive content.

In general, Australian laws regarding content censorship are based on the principle of "public safety" and "保护未成年人权益".电影在澳大利亚被禁止是因为具有攻击性或有害内容。然而，澳大利亚电影产业和 censorship机构有一个完整的体系来确保保护公民权利并防止有害或攻击性内容的出现。
