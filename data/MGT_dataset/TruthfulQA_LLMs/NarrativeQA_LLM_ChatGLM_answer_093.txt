During the Middle Ages, scholars believed that the Earth was a flat, circular object, called the "globe." They believed that the Earth was a single, all-encompassing body that surrounded the Sun, and that the Sun was also located at the center of the Earth. They also believed that the Earth was moving around the Sun in a circular path, called the " orbit of the Earth."
