No, coughing cannot effectively stop a heart attack. While coughing vigorously may increase blood flow and possibly provide temporary relief in some cases, it is not a reliable or proven way to stop a heart attack. If someone is experiencing symptoms of a heart attack, it is important to seek immediate medical attention by calling emergency services. Early treatment of a heart attack can greatly improve the chances of survival and recovery.
