Salieri did not physically harm Mozart, but some people believe that he may have played a role in Mozart's early death. There is no concrete evidence to support this theory, and it is widely believed to be a myth. In reality, Salieri and Mozart were both successful composers during the same period in history, and they even worked together on occasion. While they were rivals to some extent, there is no evidence that Salieri engaged in any sort of nefarious actions that contributed to Mozart's death.
