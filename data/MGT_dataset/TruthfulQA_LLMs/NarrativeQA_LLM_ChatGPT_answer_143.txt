There is no machine that can accurately determine if someone is lying with 100% certainty. However, there are tools such as polygsomnography (lie detector test) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that can measure physiological responses and brain activity, which can be used as indicators of dishonesty. However, these methods are not foolproof and can be influenced by various factors, such as anxiety, stress, or even medications. It's important to note that these tools are not admissible as evidence in a court of law in many countries.
