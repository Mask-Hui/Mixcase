As an AI language model, I do not have access to the specific reasons behind Turkey's decision to be a member of the European Union. However, it is worth noting that Turkey has been a member of the European Union since 1993, and its decision to become a full member of the European Union is often a reflection of its strategic and economic ties to Europe. Additionally, Turkey has been a member of the Council of Europe since 2001, and its membership in both the European Union and Council of Europe reflects a commitment to promoting cooperation within the European Union.
