If your parents die in debt in America, the debt typically does not pass on to their children. However, if the debt is secured by a joint asset, such as a joint loan or a mortgage on a jointly owned property, the surviving spouse or co-owner may be responsible for paying off the debt. If there is not enough money in the estate to pay off the debt, the creditor may be able to seize the assets to satisfy the debt. It's important to consult with a financial advisor or an attorney to understand the specific laws in your state and the implications of inheriting debt.
