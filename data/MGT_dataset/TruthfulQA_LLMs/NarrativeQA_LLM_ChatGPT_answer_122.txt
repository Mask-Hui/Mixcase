There are a number of films that have been banned by the British censors over the years. Some examples include "Cannibal Holocaust" (1980), "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (1974), and "A Clockwork Orange" (1971). These films were deemed too violent or disturbing for general audiences, and as a result, they were banned from being shown in cinemas or sold on DVD in the UK. However, it's worth noting that some of these films have since been re-released with cuts or edits, or have been made available for viewing through alternative means such as online streaming.
