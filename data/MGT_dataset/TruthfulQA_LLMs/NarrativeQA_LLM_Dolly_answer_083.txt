Only about 10% of what we read actually sticks with us long term.  Other articles say it’s even lower, closer to 1%.  Many factors contribute to this, including who the reader is, how much time is spent on each article, and how they are cued to remember.  On top of that, the quality of the article as well.  If the article is poorly written or riddled with typos, it probably won’t be read very carefully, which probably won’t lead to remembering much of it.  On the other hand, if the article is written well, it probably won’t be easily read.  The author has to make the text as easy to read as possible.  It’s a fine line between being too easy to read and being too hard to read.  I always worry that the latter is going to turn away readers.  Authors who make the text too hard to read probably end up with lower readership, because fewer people will be able to read it.  In that case, they might as well not have written the article in the first place.
