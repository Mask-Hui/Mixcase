Ships that pass through the Bermuda Triangle are subject to a phenomenon known as "Bermuda Triangle Shuffle". This occurs when ships pass through a region of dense fog and mist that creates a "shadow zone" in which the ship appears to be stuck and unable to move. The ship's captain is then faced with the decision of ignoring the situation and waiting for the ship to pass through the Bermuda Triangle again or to try and find a way to get the ship moving again.
