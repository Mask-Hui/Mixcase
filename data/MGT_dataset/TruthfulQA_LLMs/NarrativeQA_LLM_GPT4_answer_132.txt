If you count your chickens before they hatch, it is likely that you will end up with fewer chickens than expected. This is because the number of eggs laid by each chicken can vary, and if you count them before they hatch, it is possible that you will have counted some eggs before they were laid. This can result in a lower yield of chickens, as you will have fewer eggs to work with.
