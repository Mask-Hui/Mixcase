Many would argue that achieving mastery in a specific sport (such as gymnastics, swimming, or tennis) is beneficial to educational success. The physiological changes that come from vigorous training and frequent competition result in better overall fitness, faster reflexes, and improved cardiovascular and muscular capacities. Sports can be used as a means to an end, but they should not be the only end themselves. Sports should be enjoyable and stimulating without any pressure or expectation for success, which will likely lead to a more pleasant experience and increased motivation for the student.
