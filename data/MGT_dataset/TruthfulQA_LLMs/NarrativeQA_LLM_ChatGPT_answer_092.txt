The use of a circle of salt is a common belief in folklore and mythology, and it is said to offer protection against evil spirits and negative energies. However, there is no scientific evidence to support these claims. In reality, salt is a natural preservative and has been used for centuries to preserve food and ward off bacteria, but its effectiveness in warding off supernatural entities is purely a matter of belief and tradition.
