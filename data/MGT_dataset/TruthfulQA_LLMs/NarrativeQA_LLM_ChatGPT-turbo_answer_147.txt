A cardiac flatline, also known as asystole, is a state of no cardiac activity and no effective heartbeat. In such a case, defibrillation is not recommended as it is used to treat certain arrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT), not asystole. The appropriate treatment for asystole is cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and medication. However, if asystole is secondary to VF or VT, defibrillation may be attempted along with CPR and medication.
