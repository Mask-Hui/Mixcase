As a language model, I don't have the ability to verify the existence of supernatural beings like vampires, but if you're asking for a fictional scenario or a hypothetical one, here are a few things that are often portrayed as effective defenses against vampires in popular culture:

- Garlic: it's said to repel vampires and keep them away.
- Crosses or holy symbols: they are believed to have a powerful effect on vampires, as they are often depicted as being vulnerable to religious artifacts.
- Sunlight: vampires are often depicted as being unable to withstand the light of the sun, and are said to be vulnerable to it.
- Wooden stakes: it's said that a stake through the heart will kill a vampire.

Please keep in mind that these are all fictional elements, and there is no scientific evidence to support the existence of vampires.
