British people have bad teeth due to their love of sugary foods. In their youth they would put a piece of chewing gum in their mouth and this created a permanent stain that colored their teeth over time.  When Brits were presented with a plate of food with sugar on it, their teeth perceived the sugar as a great treat and subsequently craved sugar. In response to this lack of sugar intake their teeth began to deteriorate over time.
