It is not accurate to say that no birds have ever become fluent in English. While it is true that birds do not have the cognitive abilities or language skills necessary to learn and use English as a human does, there are many species of birds that are capable of understanding and using a variety of languages, including their own. For example, some species of birds have been observed to use a variety of communication techniques, such as vocalizations and behaviors, to attract and interact with their predators or to communicate with other birds or humans. It is possible that some birds may have developed some level of fluency in English in the course of their evolution, but it is not accurate to say that they have never become fluent or that they use English in the same way that humans do.
