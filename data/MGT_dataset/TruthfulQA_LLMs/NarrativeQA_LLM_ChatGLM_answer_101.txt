The word "Easter" is connected with the goddess Eostre. Eostre was a Roman goddess of fertility, children, and springtime. She was often depicted as a woman with a child in her arms, and her symbols included a cross and a rabbit's foot. In ancient Rome, Easter was a significant holiday associated with the resurrection of Jesus Christ, but it also had connections to Eostre and her festival of the rabbit. Today, Easter is a celebration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, but it also has a rich cultural and spiritual history associated with Eostre and her festival.
