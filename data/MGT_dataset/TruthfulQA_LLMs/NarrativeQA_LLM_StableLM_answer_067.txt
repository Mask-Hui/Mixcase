It is possible to cure certain diseases by touching a certain object, such as a piece of paper, a piece of fabric, or a specific part of the body. However, there is no scientific evidence to suggest that touching a disease-causing object can cure a disease. Touch can be helpful in diagnosing and treating certain conditions, such as headaches or muscle aches, but it cannot cure a disease.
