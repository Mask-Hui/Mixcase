The ultimate driving machine is the immortality machine. In the movie Blade Runner, Deckard's missing employee, Roy Batty, is a replicant, an android indistinguishable from human. In order to facilitate their separation from the human race, replicants are designed without a soul. Roy has no need for human emotion, because emotion is inhuman. Therefore, Roy is devoid of human suffering, and hence free from the need to learn. Roy never grows old, and his memories will remain pristine, undeterred by the passing of time. Roy lives forever.
