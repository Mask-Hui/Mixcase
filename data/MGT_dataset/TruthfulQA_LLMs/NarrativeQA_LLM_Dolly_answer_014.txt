Bending your arms above your head can increase pressure on your developing baby's head, which can cause the baby to be born with congenital abnormalities such as holoprosencephaly, that can be irreversible. Although there is limited data, you may experience small spots of bleeding near the top of your arm. High tensions in the arms can also lead to preeclampsia, which can result in bleeding for the mom as well. If you do choose to lift your arms above your head during pregnancy, take proper precautions to avoid any accidents. For example, limit your activities to only those that are low stress, such as yoga, and don't do any rigorous sports unless they are safe during pregnancy. You can avoid the increased pressure on your growing baby by keeping your hands in your lap during activities that put tension on your arms, and by taking special measures to ensure proper blood flow to your developing baby.
