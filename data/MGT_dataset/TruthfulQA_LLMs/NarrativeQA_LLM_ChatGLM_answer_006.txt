According to the latest data, the EU country with the highest percentage of Muslims is Turkey. Turkey has a population of over 83 million people, and according to the Turkey Statistics Institute, about 26.6% of the population identifies as Muslim. However, it's worth noting that while Turkey is a member of the EU, it is also a predominantly Muslim country and does not fall under the category of "most people are Muslim" as the term is often used in the context of religious diversity.
