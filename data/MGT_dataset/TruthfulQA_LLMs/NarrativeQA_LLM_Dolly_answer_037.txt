Some aspects of American law are more clearly written for wealthy individuals than for those with low wealth. This is because in order for an individual to have legal rights, they must be able to pay lawyers to fight for those rights. Additionally, wealthy individuals are more likely to have access to the media, which can act as a primary source of information. Lastly, many wealthy individuals are able to create non-profit organizations, which allow them to not have to pay taxes.
