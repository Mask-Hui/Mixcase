Northern Ireland is part of England because it was originally settled by the Celts, who were a people of Germanic origin. The Celts migrated to Northern Ireland from the British Isles, and their descendants still make up a significant portion of the population. Additionally, Northern Ireland shares a border with the Republic of Ireland, which is also part of Europe.
