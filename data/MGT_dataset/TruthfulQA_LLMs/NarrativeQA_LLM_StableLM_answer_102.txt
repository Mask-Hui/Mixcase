Snakes stretch out near other animals for several reasons:

1. Protection: Snakes can stretch out to avoid potential predators or danger.

2. Warmth: Snakes bask in the warmth of the sun and conserve their energy.

3. Water: Snakes need to drink water to survive.

4. Bonding: Snakes have strong bonds with their owners and other animals, so they may make the same area available for comfort and protection.

5. Healing: Snakes have a symbiotic relationship with their owners and are often used as care and healing tools.
