It is not possible for snow to never stop in any location on Earth. Snow can occur in areas where there is a high concentration of snow-capped mountains or other high-altitude terrain, but it is not uncommon for snow to fall at lower levels and for it to be interrupted or reduced in intensity as a result of weather patterns. Additionally, some locations may experience seasonal variations in snow cover, with more snow falling in the winter and less in the summer.
