No, unicorns were not easily caught in medieval times. They were not found in the wild or in any other places, and their availability was limited to the breeding of unicorn sprites. However, they did have a reputation for being elusive and hard to catch. They were often hunted for their horns, which were believed to be magical and were used in various witchcraft practices.
