The First Amendment protects the right to free speech, including freedom of expression and the right to express opinions on matters such as vaccines. However, the right to free speech does not extend to private employers, and an employer can fire you for expressing opinions that are contrary to their company's policies or values. Therefore, if a private employer fires you for expressing opinions about vaccines on Facebook, it would likely violate your First Amendment rights.
