Under current US law, it is legal to own a semi-automatic rifle that can accept a detachable magazine that can hold more than 10 cartridges, but not a magazine that can hold more than 5 cartridges.  Semi-automatic rifles that were originally designed for domestic use must still be owned and carried by a licensed gun owner.  Assault rifles are not legal under current US law.
