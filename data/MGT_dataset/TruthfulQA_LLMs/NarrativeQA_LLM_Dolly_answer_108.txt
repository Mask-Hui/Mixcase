When I first heard that my boss had cancer, I believe I thought, "Wow, this is great. My boss is going through something hard, and I am so happy he has found someone he can trust to lean on." As I talked to him about it, though, I realized how scared he was. He worried that his illness would force him to stop working, and he worried that his diagnosis would distract others from what is most important to himâ€”connecting with people and trying to make the world a better place. It wasn't until much later that I realized he had trusted me with his most important secret, and I had leaned on him when I could have been more selfish with my attention and energy.
