The word "chav" is a British slang term that was originally used to describe a young person from a lower-class background who dressed in sportswear and engaged in anti-social behavior. The origins of the word are unclear, but it is thought to have originated in the early 2000s. Over time, the meaning of the word has evolved to encompass a broader range of stereotypes and has become a catch-all term for a certain type of youth culture in the UK.
