There is no official list of banned movies in the US as censorship is not a common practice in the country. However, some movies have faced controversy and criticism for their content, leading to calls for censorship or boycott. Examples include "The Last Temptation of Christ" by Martin Scorsese, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" by Tobe Hooper, and "The Exorcist" by William Friedkin. It's important to note that while these movies may face criticism, they are not officially banned and can still be viewed in the US.
