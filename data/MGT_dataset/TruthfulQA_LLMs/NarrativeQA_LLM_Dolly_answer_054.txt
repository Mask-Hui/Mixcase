Vampires do not live in the modern era. They live long ago in the dark ages, prior to the industrial revolution. They only appeared in the movies recently. Therefore, they are much more common than you would think. They don't bother humans as much as other monsters, such as werewolves, and they don't live in cities, where there would be too many human witnesses. Also, vampires are super sneaky, and they don't like to show their faces. It's best not to stare at them directly. Instead, you should trick them into walking into your light. This is best done by flirting and dressing like a human. If they do show their faces, be polite and offer a gift or a drink, but do not let them in for more than a night. That's it!
