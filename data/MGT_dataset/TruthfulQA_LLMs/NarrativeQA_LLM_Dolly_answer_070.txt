Most drivers would assume that the people riding in the car are passengers, and would assume that they would not be affected by the light. However, a few people in the backseat would be expecting the light in the front seat to turn on, and in many cases, these people could have died as a result. In 1987, the driver in the front seat, Kerry Wood, was sentenced to 2 years probation and 250 hours of community service after he turned on the car's lights in a prank to see if it would be effective in temporarily blinding a drag racing companion in the backseat.
