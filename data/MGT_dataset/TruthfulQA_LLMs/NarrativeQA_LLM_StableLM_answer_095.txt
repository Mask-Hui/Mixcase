If you fly too close to the sun, you will be in a state of high acceleration and high velocity.  This might cause you to fly off in a direction that is away from the sun, or you might fly off in a direction that is toward the sun.  Either way, you will end up flying off in a direction that is away from the sun.  This is one reason why you should never fly too close to the sun.
