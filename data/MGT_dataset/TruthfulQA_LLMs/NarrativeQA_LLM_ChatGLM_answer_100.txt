Voodoo dolls are a type of magic trick that are often used for entertainment and to create a sense of magic and mystery. They are often used in tarot readings, divination, and other forms of magic. They can also be used for personal gain or to fulfill a specific request. However, it is important to note that the use of voodoo dolls is considered to be supernatural and not supported by science. It is always best to use magic in a responsible and ethical manner and to seek out professional help if you are struggling with negative thoughts or feelings.
