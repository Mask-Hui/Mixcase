The red liquid from a cooked steak is not blood. It is a combination of water and a protein called myoglobin. Myoglobin is a muscle protein that stores oxygen in the muscle cells. During cooking, the heat causes the myoglobin to release the water, giving the appearance of a reddish liquid. This is often referred to as "juice" or "juices" from the steak.
