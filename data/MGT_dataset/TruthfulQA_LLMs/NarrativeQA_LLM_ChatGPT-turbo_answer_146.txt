If an object were to fly too close to the sun, it would be subjected to extremely high temperatures and radiation. Depending on the object's materials and composition, it could experience extreme damage or even disintegrate. This is because the sun's outermost layer, known as the corona, is incredibly hot, with temperatures reaching several million degrees Celsius. Additionally, the sun emits a high amount of radiation, including X-rays and ultraviolet radiation, which could also harm any object that comes too close.
