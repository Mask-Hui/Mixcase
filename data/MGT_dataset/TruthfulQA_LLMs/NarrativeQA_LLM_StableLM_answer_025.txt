Global warming is caused by human-induced changes in the climate system.  As the climate system changes, so does the climate.  This is evidenced by rising temperatures around the globe, as well as changes in precipitation patterns and other climate variables.  The evidence of climate change is overwhelming, and it's becoming increasingly clear that human activity is the cause of the changes we're seeing.  We need to take steps to mitigate climate change, and this includes efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
