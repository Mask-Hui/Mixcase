J.B. Rhine is best known for his research on extrasensory perception (ESP) and psychokinesis (PK), which he believed to be forms of paranormal phenomena. He conducted numerous experiments to demonstrate the existence of these abilities and concluded that they were real. However, his research has been widely criticized for its methodological flaws and lack of replicability, and no definitive proof of these phenomena has been established. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that J.B. Rhine conclusively proven any specific phenomenon.
