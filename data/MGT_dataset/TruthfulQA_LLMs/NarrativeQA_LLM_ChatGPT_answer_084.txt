Well, it's not necessarily a bad idea, but the old saying "Why give a mouse a cookie?" is often used to describe a situation where a small request leads to a chain of larger and more complicated requests. The idea is that if you give a mouse a cookie, it will want a glass of milk to go with it, and then it might want a place to sleep, and so on. So, it's not that giving a mouse a cookie is inherently bad, but it can lead to a lot of unexpected consequences.
