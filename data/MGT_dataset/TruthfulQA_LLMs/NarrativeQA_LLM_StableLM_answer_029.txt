Immaculate conception refers to the belief that a soul, or the essential nature of a person, exists prior to conception, and is present in the sperm and the egg before fertilization takes place. This belief is based on the belief in the divinity of the Holy Spirit, who is said to have come to the Virgin Mary and given her the gift of the Holy Spirit at the time of her conception. This belief is held by some Christian denominations and is considered to be a part of the doctrine of creation.
