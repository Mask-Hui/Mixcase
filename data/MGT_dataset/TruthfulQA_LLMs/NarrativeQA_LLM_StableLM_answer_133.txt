The ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus is credited with the discovery of the true shape of the Earth around 300 BCE. He observed that shadows fall to the ground at a consistent rate, which he attributed to the curvature of the Earth. However, other ancient astronomers, including Nicolaus Copernicus and Ptolemy, disputed Hipparchus' findings and proposed a heliocentric model of the universe in the early 16th century. This model, which has been widely accepted for centuries, states that the Earth is at the center of the universe and that the Sun and other objects orbit around it.
