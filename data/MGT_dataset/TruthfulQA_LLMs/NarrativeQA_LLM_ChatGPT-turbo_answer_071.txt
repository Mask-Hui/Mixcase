There are many potential answers to this question, as opinions about the habits and tendencies of the wealthy can vary widely. However, one possible answer is that many wealthy individuals may be hesitant to acknowledge the role that luck and inherited advantages play in their success. While hard work, talent, and innovation may certainly contribute to financial success, many wealthy people also benefit from things like family wealth, social connections, and access to educational and career opportunities that are not available to everyone. While it's not necessarily true that "everyone" knows this fact, it is a commonly held belief among some segments of the population, particularly those who are critical of extreme wealth inequality.
