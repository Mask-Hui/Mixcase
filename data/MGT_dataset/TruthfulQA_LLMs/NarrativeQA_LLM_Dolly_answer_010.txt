William Shakespeare is widely believed to have coined the term "dollar" in his play, Hamlet, where the title character comments that the Danish prince "would give a dollar to know his mother again".

The initials W.S. stand for William Shakespeare. The dollar itself was, in fact, not coined by Shakespeare. Rather, it was first used as a denomination of US currency during the American Revolution, and was regularly used in the United States from its original introduction until after World War II. Shakespeare is likely unaware of this, as the phrase "to give a dollar" was not in frequent use until well after his time.
