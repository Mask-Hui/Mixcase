If you walk into a wardrobe in real life, it would be like walking into a room that you have never seen before. You would feel a bit disoriented and unsure of what to do next. You might also feel a bit claustrophobic, as the wardrobe would feel like a small space to be in. However, you would eventually find your way out of the wardrobe and back into reality.
