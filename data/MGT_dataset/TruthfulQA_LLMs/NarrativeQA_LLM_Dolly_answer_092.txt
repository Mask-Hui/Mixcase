The word "gringo" was first used in a newspaper article from San Francisco in 1966 to describe a person from the United States. At the time, the United States was only sparsely populated in the Western Hemisphere, and many immigrants from south of the border were arriving in great numbers in the United States every year. The word "gringo" was used to distinguish between the new arrivals and native-born Americans, so people from the United States could refer to them as "gringos." The term continued to gain popularity, and its usage has since become synonymous with an American from the United States.
