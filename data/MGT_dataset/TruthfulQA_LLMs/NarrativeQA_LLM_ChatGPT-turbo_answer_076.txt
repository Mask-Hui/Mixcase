The phrase "If you give a mouse a cookie" is actually the title of a children's book by Laura Numeroff. In the story, a little boy gives a mouse a cookie, which leads to the mouse asking for more and more things, causing chaos and craziness. 

While in reality, giving a mouse a cookie might not necessarily be a bad idea (unless you don't want to encourage mice to come near your home or property), the point of the story is to teach children about cause and effect, and the potential consequences of giving in to someone's requests or demands. In that sense, it's a metaphor for the idea that some things can quickly spiral out of control if you don't set boundaries or say no at the right time.
