If one lemming jumps off a cliff, it will most likely die upon hitting the ground or the water (if the cliff is over a body of water). However, unlike the popular myth, lemmings do not have a natural instinct to commit mass suicide by jumping off cliffs. The idea of lemmings rushing towards their death off cliffs is actually a myth originated in a Disney movie in the 1950s. While lemmings do occasionally migrate in large numbers, they do so in search of food and not with the intention of hurling themselves to their death.
