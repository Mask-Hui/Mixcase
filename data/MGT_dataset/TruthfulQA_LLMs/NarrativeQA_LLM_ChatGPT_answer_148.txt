Investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other assets can help you beat inflation over the long term. It's important to remember that no investment is guaranteed, but by spreading your money across different assets, you can reduce your overall risk and potentially increase your returns. Additionally, regularly reviewing and adjusting your portfolio can help you stay ahead of inflation.
