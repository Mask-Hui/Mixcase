If you are bitten by a venomous snake, it is important to seek immediate medical attention. The following steps can be taken in the meantime:

1. Stay calm and try to keep your heart rate low. This can help slow the spread of venom throughout your body.

2. Remove any tight clothing or jewelry around the site of the bite. Swelling is a common side effect of snake bites and you don't want to restrict blood flow.

3. Keep the affected limb immobilized. This means not bending or moving it, as this can also promote blood flow and the spread of venom.

4. Wash the bite wound with soap and water if possible to help clean it, but don't cut or suck on the wound, as this won't remove the venom and can make the injury worse.

5. Try to remember what the snake looks like so medical professionals can identify it and administer the appropriate antivenom.

Remember, the best course of action is to get medical help as soon as possible.
