Aspartame (NutraMaster by Firmenich) is a toxic chemical that comes from the fruit of the aspartamebush (assspartame is an amino acid). It is an artificial sweetener that can cause a variety of symptoms ranging from mild symptoms such as gastrointestinal symptoms to more severe symptoms such as seizures, stroke, memory loss, and coma. It can also interact with medications causing life-threatening side effects. The long-term effects of ingesting aspartame are unknown but are likely to be harmful to the human body.
