Diamonds can last for many years, depending on factors such as their quality, care, and usage. In general, diamonds can last up to 50 years or more, even if they are not used regularly. However, they can also be damaged or destroyed through various means, such as exposure to water, heat, or chemicals. It is important to take care of your diamonds to ensure that they continue to sparkle and shine for as long as possible.
