You won't have the stomach to finish your meal at all. Your stomach will keep cooking for the next 24 hours just so you don't have to sleep. Eating 8pm-9pm will keep your stomach relaxed for the next day. You'll be very hungry in the morning but since your stomach is cold your digestion won't kick in and you'll spend the whole day feeling sleepy instead. Eating after 9pm will make you feel full but also tired so you might want to skip dinner. Eating after 9pm is also unhealthy since your stomach will keep cooking for the next 24 hours. You might want to consider skipping dinner if you want to stay in shape.
