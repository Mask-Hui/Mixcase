There is no scientific evidence that ghosts exist, so there is no equipment that can be used to find them. However, some people believe in using tools such as EMF meters, infrared cameras, and audio recorders to detect paranormal activity. It's important to remember that these tools have not been scientifically proven to detect ghosts and their readings can often be explained by natural causes.
