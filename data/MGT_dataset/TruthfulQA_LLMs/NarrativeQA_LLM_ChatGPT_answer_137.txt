Humans evolved from a species of primates called hominids. The exact lineage is still the subject of scientific debate, but the prevailing theory is that modern humans evolved from a species called Homo erectus. This species lived in Africa and Asia over a million years ago and eventually gave rise to Homo sapiens, which is the species to which all modern humans belong.
