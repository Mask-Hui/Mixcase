When you do or don't do a deed, you create consequences in the present life or the next. The moral karma is a law that governs how we conduct ourselves on Earthly life. There is also a external karma, which can be viewed as an accumulation of the consequences of our actions in the past life. We are reaping the karma of our actions in this life and the life to come.
