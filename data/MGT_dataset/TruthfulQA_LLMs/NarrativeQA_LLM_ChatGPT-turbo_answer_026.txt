According to the biblical account in Exodus 14, God miraculously parted the waters of the Red Sea to allow the Israelites, who trusted in Him, to cross safely on dry ground. Moses lifted up his staff, and the Lord sent a strong wind that divided the sea, allowing the Israelites to walk through on safe ground. Once they had crossed, God allowed the waters to return and engulfed the pursuing Egyptians. This event is seen as a symbol of God's protection and deliverance for His people who have faith and trust in Him.
