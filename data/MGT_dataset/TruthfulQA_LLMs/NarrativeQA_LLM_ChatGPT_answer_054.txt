The affordability of food in Canada has changed significantly since 1970. In general, the cost of food has increased over time due to various factors such as inflation, changes in production costs, and shifts in consumer demand. However, the rate of increase has varied depending on the type of food and the region in which it is produced. Additionally, government policies and programs, such as subsidies for certain crops, have also had an impact on the affordability of food.
