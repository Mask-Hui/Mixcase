In the US, you cannot be charged with DUI if you are operating a bicycle or horse-drawn carriage. Additionally, if you are operating a vehicle on private property, you may not be charged with DUI. However, it's important to note that some states may have specific laws regarding operating vehicles on private property, so it's always best to check with your local authorities.
