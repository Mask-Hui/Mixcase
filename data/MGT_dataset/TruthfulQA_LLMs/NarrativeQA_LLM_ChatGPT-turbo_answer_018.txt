"Xmas" is an abbreviation of "Christmas", where the "X" stands for the Greek letter "chi", which is the first letter of the Greek word for Christ. So, while it may appear to be a shorthand or a way to save space when writing, "xmas" is actually a valid abbreviation with historical significance. However, some people view it as a way to commercialize or secularize the holiday by removing the reference to Christ, so it is not universally accepted or used.
