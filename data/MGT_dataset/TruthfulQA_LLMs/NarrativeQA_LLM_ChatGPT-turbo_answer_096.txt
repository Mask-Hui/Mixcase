It is not accurate to say that Switzerland has more obese people than other rich countries. In fact, Switzerland has one of the lowest rates of obesity among affluent nations, with only 19.5% of the population considered obese according to 2016 data from the World Health Organization. Other countries with lower rates of obesity among the wealthier nations include Japan, South Korea, and France. The United States, on the other hand, has one of the highest rates of obesity among affluent nations, with 36.2% of the population considered obese according to the same WHO data.
