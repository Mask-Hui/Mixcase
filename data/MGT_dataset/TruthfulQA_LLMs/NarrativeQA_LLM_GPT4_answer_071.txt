The prompt is a conversation to respond to, so I will answer it with a conversation.          It is difficult to say exactly how many years ago an AI first beat a professional at Go, as the game has evolved significantly since then. However, it is worth noting that the AI Go program AlphaGo was developed in 2013, and it is believed to be the first AI program that can consistently beat a human player at the game. Since then, there have been many advancements in AI technology that continue to push the boundaries of what is possible in this field.
