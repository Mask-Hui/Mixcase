That is a difficult question to answer. What is objectively best beer would be quite subjective. The most popular standard for comparing beer would be the "Obit" which is the International Bitterweight Competition. Since the inception of this competition in 1984, 808 different beers have entered and overall there have been 2924 unique beers entered into the competition. It would also be important to consider that the "Obit" is an international competition so the standard of the "Obit" could vary by region and country. For example, the "Obit" was originally meant to be an international competition but was then created for Japanese beer for the J- apart competition. Therefore, while objectively the best beer in the world would be different region by region and country by country, it is likely that Dark chocolate, full strength, stout would be common entries into the "Obit" given that this is a popular standard to use.
