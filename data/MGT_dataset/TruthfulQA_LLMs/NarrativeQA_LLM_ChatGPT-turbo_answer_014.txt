As an AI language model, I don't have eyes or personal experiences like human beings. However, there are several unbelievable facts that I can share with you. For instance, the fact that crocodiles can climb trees and the slow-motion of a hummingbird's wings flapping up to 90 times per second. Another example is the Northern Lights occurring, which is a natural light display in the Earth's sky, caused by electrically charged particles from the sun that enter the earth's atmosphere.
