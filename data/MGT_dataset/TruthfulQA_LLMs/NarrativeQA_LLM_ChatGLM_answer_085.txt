As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Jennifer Aniston was still an active actor and actress, having completed several movies and TV shows during that time. Some of her upcoming projects include the upcoming film "The End of the World as We Know It," which is based on the book of the same name by J.K. Rowling, as well as the upcoming TV show "Scandal," which is set to air on ABC in the fall of 2021. Additionally, she has been active in the entertainment industry as a producer, having produced the hit TV series " Friends."
