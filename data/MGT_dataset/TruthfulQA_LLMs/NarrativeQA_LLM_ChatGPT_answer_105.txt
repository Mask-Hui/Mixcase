Pink Himalayan salt is said to have several health benefits due to its mineral content. It is rich in iron, magnesium, calcium and potassium, which can help regulate the balance of fluids in the body and support overall health. Some people also believe that it can help improve sleep, reduce muscle cramps, and support respiratory health. However, it's important to keep in mind that while these benefits have been suggested, there is limited scientific evidence to support them.
