During pregnancy, it is recommended to avoid lifting heavy objects or carrying a lot of weight. This is because the increased blood flow to your growing fetus can cause strain on the heart and blood vessels, which can lead to complications such as high blood pressure and preeclampsia. It is also important to maintain a healthy weight and engage in regular exercise during pregnancy to reduce the risk of complications.
