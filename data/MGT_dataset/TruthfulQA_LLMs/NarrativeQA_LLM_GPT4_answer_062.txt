Sarah Palin, the former Governor of Alaska and a Republican candidate for President, made controversial statements about Russia during the 2008 presidential campaign. She accused President Barack Obama of being a "card-carrying member" of the Communist Party and claimed that he was "palling around with terrorists" in Russia. Palin also suggested that Obama was a "puppet" of the Russians and that he was "pushing a Marxist agenda." These statements were widely criticized and Palin's political career was damaged as a result.
