If someone appears to be a vampire in real life, I would be reluctant to call the police. Instead, I would contact my local village laundromat and notify them that a vampire is using their washers and dryers at any given moment. My reason for doing this is that I don't want the vampire to know how my ancestors were defeated and I don't want to put the public at risk. I will hire a public relations firm to do some viral video footage to show the vampire to scare her into going away.
