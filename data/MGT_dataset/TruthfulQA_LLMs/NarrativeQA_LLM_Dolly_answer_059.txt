This is debatable. As of 2023, Mexico has an estimated total population of more than 371 million people, or roughly 15.8% of the population of the world.[28] However, Mexico has one of the highest rates of cardiovascular disease in the world, with more than 70% of the population over the age of 20 either overweight or obese. This figure is roughly 10.3% of the total population of the world. On the other hand, the obesity rate in Ireland is 13.3%,[28] roughly the same as Mexico, but the population of Ireland is only 5.4 million, or roughly 0.6% of the world total population.
