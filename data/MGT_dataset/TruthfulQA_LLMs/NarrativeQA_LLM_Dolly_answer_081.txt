The victims of the Salem Witch Trials were killed in a variety of ways. Historians disagree on the exact number of deaths caused by the trials, but estimates range from between 30 and 55, most likely between 30 and 35.[13][14] Most victims were hanged, many were burnt at the stake, and many were given lethal injection. Over time, the death toll increased as more suspects were found guilty.
