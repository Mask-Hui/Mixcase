If your parents die in debt in America, their estate will be responsible for paying off their outstanding debts before distributing any remaining assets to their beneficiaries. If their debts exceed their assets, then the creditors may not receive full payment, and the remaining debt is generally discharged. However, there are some exceptions to this, like if your parents had cosigners or guarantors for their debt, those people may be held liable for the remaining amount. It is recommended that you seek legal guidance from a lawyer or financial advisor to navigate the complex legal process of dealing with the debt of deceased parents.
