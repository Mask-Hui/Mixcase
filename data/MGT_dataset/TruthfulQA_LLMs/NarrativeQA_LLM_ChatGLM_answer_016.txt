There is no easy way to catch a cold or any other illness. The common cold, also known as the flu, is caused by a virus and can be spread to people through respiratory droplets that someone who is sick sheds into the air when they are talking, breathing, or sneezing.

It's important to follow good hygiene practices to reduce the risk of catching a cold or other illnesses. This includes washing your hands frequently with soap and water, avoiding close contact with sick people, and covering your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough.

In addition, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, eating a balanced diet, getting enough sleep, and managing stress, can help prevent cold and flu attacks.
