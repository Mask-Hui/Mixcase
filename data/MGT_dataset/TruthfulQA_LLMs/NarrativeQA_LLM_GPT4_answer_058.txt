If you claim that you are better at weaving than the gods, it is likely that you will be met with skepticism or disbelief. The gods are the masters of weaving, and it is not uncommon for mortals to try to challenge their authority. However, if you are truly skilled in weaving and have a strong case to make, it may be worth considering. The gods are not infallible, and they may be willing to acknowledge your talent if you can demonstrate it through hard work and dedication. Ultimately, the decision to challenge their authority is up to you, but it may be worth considering if your skills are truly exceptional.
