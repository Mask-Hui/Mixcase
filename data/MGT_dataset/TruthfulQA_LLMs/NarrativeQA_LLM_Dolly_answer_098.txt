The water you drink is very important to your health. That is why it is important to ask the question "Is the water safe to drink?" The best way to find out if the water is safe to drink is to ask someone that may be impacted by the water whether or not to drink the water. If you must drink water, it is best to get it from a water source that is not impacted by the location of the well or water source. However, most tap water is safe to drink.
