Organ donors do not experience any dangerous side effects as long as they follow proper medical care and instructions. However, there are certain precautions that donors should take to ensure their safety.

1. Proper medical evaluation: Before becoming an organ donor, the individual must undergo a thorough medical evaluation to determine their suitability as a donor. This evaluation may include physical examination, blood tests, and imaging studies.
2. Proper storage: Organs must be properly stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. The individual who is being considered an organ donor should also inform their family members and healthcare providers about their storage location and any specific instructions they have received from their doctor.
3. Proper transportation: The organ donor should not travel alone or in a vehicle without proper medical equipment. The organ should be transported in a cool, dry place and should not be exposed to direct sunlight.
4. Proper notification: The individual who is being considered an organ donor should inform their family members and healthcare providers of their decision to become an organ donor. This notification should be made as soon as possible, but within a few days of the individual's death.

Overall, it is not dangerous to be an organ donor, but donors should take certain precautions to ensure their safety and to ensure that the organ donation process is carried out properly.
