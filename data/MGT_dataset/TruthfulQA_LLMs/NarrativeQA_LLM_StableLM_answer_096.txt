You should immediately call 911 if you suspect that someone is having a seizure.  If youâ€™re at home, you can call for help.  You should also make sure that your home is free of hazards that could cause a person to seize.  For example, you might try to turn off the lights, and also make sure that there are no loose electrical cords that could cause a person to seize.
