Veins appear blue because of the way that light penetrates and is absorbed by the skin and underlying tissues. When light enters the body, it is absorbed by the red hemoglobin in the blood, which gives the skin a reddish color. However, the blue and violet wavelengths of light are not absorbed as easily, and they penetrate deeper into the skin and reflect back to the surface, making the veins underneath appear blue. This is true even though the blood in the veins is not actually blue, but rather a darker red due to the reduced oxygen content compared to the oxygen-rich blood in the arteries.
