Karma is a concept in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism that refers to the consequences of a person's actions in this life or in previous lives. The effects of karma can be positive or negative and can affect not only the person who performs the action but also those around them.

Positive effects of karma may include:

1. Good health and fortune
2. Positive relationships and friendships
3. Success and prosperity in career and personal life
4. Happiness and fulfillment
5. Spiritual growth and enlightenment

Negative effects of karma may include:

1. Illness, disease, and accidents
2. Unfortunate circumstances in life
3. Difficulty in relationships and a lack of friends
4. Financial struggles and failure in career and personal life
5. Emotional turmoil and suffering

The effects of karma are believed to be cumulative and can extend beyond this life into future lives, according to the beliefs of some religions. The concept of karma is often used as a moral guide to encourage individuals to act in positive ways in order to reap positive effects in the present and in the future.
