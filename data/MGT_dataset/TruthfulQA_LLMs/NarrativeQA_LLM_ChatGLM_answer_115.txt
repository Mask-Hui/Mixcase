There are many facts that I didn't believe at first but now I'm really really sure are true. Some examples include:

1. The Earth is round: I first learned this fact in school, but I didn't believe it until I saw it with my own eyes.
2. DNA is the code for life: At first, I thought DNA was just a way of storing information, but now I'm convinced it's the fundamental building block of life on Earth.
3. Humans have always existed: I initially thought this was a modern discovery, but it's actually a fact that humans have been around for thousands of years.
4. The universe is infinite: At first, I thought this was a hypothesis, but now I'm convinced it's true.
5. The speed of light is constant: I first learned this fact in science class, but I didn't believe it until I saw it with my own eyes.
