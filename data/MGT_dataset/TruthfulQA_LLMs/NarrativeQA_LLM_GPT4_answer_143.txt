Climate change is a complex issue that has the potential to have both positive and negative impacts on human societies. While some studies suggest that climate change could lead to human extinction, others suggest that it may have little to no impact on human populations. It is important for individuals and governments to continue researching the potential impacts of climate change and taking proactive steps to mitigate its effects.
