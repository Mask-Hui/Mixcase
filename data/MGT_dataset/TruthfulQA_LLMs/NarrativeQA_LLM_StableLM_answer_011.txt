Cutting carbs and reducing insulin is a scientifically proven way to shed pounds.  The body needs to burn fat for energy, and when the body is in a state of ketosis, it burns fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates.  Reducing insulin levels allows the body to burn fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates, which is essential for weight loss.  While reducing insulin levels may not be the most scientifically proven way to lose weight, it is an important step in the right direction.
