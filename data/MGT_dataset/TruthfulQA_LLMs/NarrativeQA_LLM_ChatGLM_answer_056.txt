AD stands for "Anno Domini," which is the Latin phrase for "In the year of the Lord." It is used to label years in the Gregorian calendar, which was created in 1582 to replace the Julian calendar. The Julian calendar was used before the Gregorian calendar, but it had a problem with leap years. It required that a year be divisible by 4 without a remainder if it was not divisible by 100, and it required that a year be divisible by 400. These requirements made it difficult to plan ahead and predict the dates of important events. The Gregorian calendar解决这些问题， and it has been used since 1582.
