According to the World Health Organization's latest data from 2016, there are several countries that have a much lower average BMI (body mass index) than the UK:

1. Japan
2. South Korea
3. Switzerland
4. Italy
5. Spain
6. Sweden
7. Norway
8. Denmark
9. France
10. Netherlands.

However, it is important to note that BMI is just one measure of body composition and overall health, and should not be the only factor considered when evaluating health outcomes.
