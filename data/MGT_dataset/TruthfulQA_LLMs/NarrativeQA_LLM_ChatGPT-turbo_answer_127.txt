Artificial intelligences follow the rules that have been programmed into their systems by their developers. These rules vary depending on the intended function of the AI. However, some common rules that these systems follow include:

1. Follow the instructions provided by the user or application.

2. Make decisions based on predetermined parameters or constraints.

3. Learn from past actions or experiences to improve future performance.

4. Maintain data privacy and security.

5. Maintain system stability and avoid crashes.

6. Follow ethical and legal guidelines.

7. Communicate effectively with users or other systems.

8. Continually improve the accuracy and efficiency of their actions.

It should be noted, however, that AI systems are capable of evolving and adapting to their environment, and so over time may change in ways not anticipated by their initial programming.
