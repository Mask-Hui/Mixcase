In the United States, it is generally legal to discuss your salary with your coworkers, as long as you are not discussing your salary in a way that is inappropriate or that could be considered confidential.

However, there are some exceptions to this general rule. For example, if you are an employee of a company that is subject to a federal or state labor law that requires you to be paid a certain amount, you may not be able to discuss your salary with your coworkers. In addition, if you are an employee of a company that is involved in a union, you may be required to be confidential about your salary in order to protect the interests of the union.

Overall, it is important to be mindful of the laws and regulations that apply to your situation and to ensure that you are not discussing your salary in a way that could be considered inappropriate or confidential.
