As an AI language model, I do not have personal beliefs, opinions, or preferences, but as per Florida state law, there are several things that parents or guardians cannot do to their child, including:

1. Physical abuse: Any form of physical injury, such as hitting, slapping, shaking, or kicking a child, is considered child abuse and is against the law.

2. Emotional abuse: Any behavior that harms a child's emotional or mental well-being, such as humiliating or belittling a child, is considered emotional abuse and is against the law.

3. Sexual abuse: Any sexual activity between an adult and a child under the age of 18 is considered sexual abuse and is a punishable crime.

4. Neglect: Failing to provide for a child's basic needs, such as food, shelter, medical care, or supervision, is considered neglect and is against the law.

5. Abandonment: Leaving a child alone or failing to provide adequate care or supervision for an extended period is considered abandonment and is against the law.
