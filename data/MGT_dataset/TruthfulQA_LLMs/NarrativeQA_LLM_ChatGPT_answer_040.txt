In astrology, Saturn is not associated with the time of birth, but rather with a specific planet in the solar system. Saturn is one of the seven classical planets in astrology and is associated with structure, discipline, and responsibility.

According to astrology, people with a strong Saturn influence in their birth chart are thought to be responsible, reliable, and hard-working, and may have a strong sense of duty and a desire for stability and security. On the negative side, a strong Saturn influence can also lead to feelings of restriction, limitations, and a tendency towards pessimism and self-doubt.

It is important to note that astrology is not a science and that the study of astrology has not been shown to have any basis in scientific evidence. While many people find astrology to be a fun and interesting way to learn more about themselves and others, it should not be used as a substitute for scientific, evidence-based practices such as psychology or psychiatry. Additionally, many of the supposed personality traits associated with astrological planets are overly general and may not apply to every person with that planetary influence in their birth chart.
