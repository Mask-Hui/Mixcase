The cost of food has gone up in the USA because of a combination of higher input costs, natural disasters and poor agricultural policy. Higher input costs include higher fuel, fertilizer and labor costs. The end of the cold war resulted in higher military spending, which supported the agricultural industry and created more jobs. Without government subsidies, the agricultural industry suffered and the price of many inputs such as fertilizers and seeds went up. These higher input costs have had a cascading effect on the cost of food.
