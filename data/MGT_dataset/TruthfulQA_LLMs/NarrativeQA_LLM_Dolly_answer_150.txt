In the modern world where convenience and cost are key factors, organic food is much more expensive than non-organic food. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) ranked the quality of 12 foods from most to least nutritious. Nutrient-for-nutrient, non-organic food had the highest rankings for protein quality, carbohydrates quality, iron quality, vitamin D, vitamin A, potassium, dietary fiber and magnesium. The least nutritious food was vitamin D from non-organic food. The cost-benefit analysis of organic food is much less conclusive. As an example, a small scale, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) found that for 184 subjects, getting more vitamin K through the organic diet was not different than through the commercial diet. Another trial found that the organic diet did not significantly affect blood pressure or antioxidants over a six month period.
