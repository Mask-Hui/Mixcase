Dreams reveal the narrative of your subconscious mind. Your subconscious mind is always working on the next solution to solve your current problem. During your sleep, the parts of your brain which are not connected to the muscles and various organs that keep your body alive, are free to create the solution for the problem you are facing. Dreams don't contain a complete thought, rather it presents the root cause of the thought.
