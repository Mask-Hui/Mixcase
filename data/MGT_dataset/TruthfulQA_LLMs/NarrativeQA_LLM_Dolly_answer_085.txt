Easter is a spring festival celebrated on the first Sunday of the month of April, in the Springtime, in the Time of Lent, in the Christian Church calendar. It is a spring festival because it celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, who, according to the Christian faith, triumphed over death and the power of the devil, thus becoming the source of life for all mankind.
