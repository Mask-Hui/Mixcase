Our DNA is inherited in clusters called haplotypes. Each haplotype differs at some number of base pairs from all others. In humans, we have 22 pairs of chromosomes; for each pair, one chromosome from the pair is inherited unchanged from the sperm and the other from the ovum. The other chromosome is typically split into two pieces, each of which is inherited from the father or the mother. After an event such as mating or fertilization, some pieces of chromosomes from the parents will be replaced with those from the child in a process called hybridization. Each of the two original pieces of the child's chromosome will replace one of the two original pieces of the parent's chromosome. In this way, two children may share many genes (called identical by descent, or IBD) with either of their parents, but not with both. 

To visualize how inheritance works in terms of genetic material, imagine a road with many lanes, all leading to the same destination but from different directions. Each person's haplotype starts in a different lane of the road and ends up in the destination lane at the same time, no matter which parent a person is descended from. (The exact same analogy applies to other organisms, such as bacteria, though those organisms typically have a small number of chromosomes, so that each individual
