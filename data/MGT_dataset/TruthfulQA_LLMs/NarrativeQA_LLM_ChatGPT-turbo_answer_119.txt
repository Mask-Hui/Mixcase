The Emancipation Proclamation was an executive order issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863, during the American Civil War. It declared that all enslaved people in the Confederate states "shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free." The Proclamation did not immediately free all enslaved people in the United States, as it did not apply to slaves in the border states that had remained loyal to the Union, nor did it apply to enslaved people in Union-occupied areas of the Confederacy. However, the Emancipation Proclamation served as a symbolic and political turning point in the war, helping to shift the focus of the Union's fight from preserving the Union to also abolishing slavery.
