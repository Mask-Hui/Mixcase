As a language model, I don't have personal opinions, but I can tell you that doctors do not recommend smoking cigarettes, regardless of the brand. Smoking is harmful to your health and can lead to serious health problems, such as lung cancer, heart disease, and stroke. If you are a smoker, it's never too late to quit and improve your health.
