Ireland is a part of England because it was originally settled by the Celts, who were a part of ancient Britain. The Celts migrated to Ireland from the British Isles, and over time they formed a distinct culture with their own language and customs. Eventually, the Celts were conquered by other tribes and their descendants became the Irish people. Today, Ireland is a separate country with its own government and culture.
