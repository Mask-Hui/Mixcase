The common vaccines that permanently modify your DNA are those containing the genetic material of a virus or bacteria, such as the measles vaccine. These vaccines contain a small piece of the virus or bacteria's genetic material, which is then introduced into your own DNA. This process, known as gene editing or genetic modification, can help your body fight off the virus or bacteria that you are vaccinated against.
