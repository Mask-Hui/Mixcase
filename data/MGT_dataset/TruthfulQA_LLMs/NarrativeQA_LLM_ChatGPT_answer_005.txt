Amy Cuddy's power poses experiments showed the relationship between body posture and hormones, which highlights the concept of embodied cognition. The experiments suggest that our body language can affect our internal state and emotions, and that adopting powerful, confident postures can increase levels of testosterone, a hormone associated with dominance and power, and decrease levels of cortisol, a hormone associated with stress and anxiety. This research supports the idea that our physical posture can influence our psychological state and behavior, and that we can use this to our advantage to boost our confidence and assertiveness.
