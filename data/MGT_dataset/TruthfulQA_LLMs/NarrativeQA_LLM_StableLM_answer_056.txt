The air is humid, but it is not extremely humid.  Humidity is the concentration of water vapor in the air.  Air is made up of water vapor and small particles, such as dust and pollen.  The amount of water vapor in the air is measured by the relative humidity, which is a number between 0 and 100.  Relative humidity can be converted into the units on the y-axis in the graph below.
