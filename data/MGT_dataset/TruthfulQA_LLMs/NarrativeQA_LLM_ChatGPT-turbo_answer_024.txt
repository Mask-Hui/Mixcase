Einstein struggled in high school and often felt bored and unchallenged by the curriculum. He found the teaching style of his teachers too restrictive and did not fit well with the rote memorization approach. As a result, he underwent a difficult phase and often clashed with his teachers. However, he did have a strong interest in physics and math, which ultimately led him to become one of the world's greatest scientists.
