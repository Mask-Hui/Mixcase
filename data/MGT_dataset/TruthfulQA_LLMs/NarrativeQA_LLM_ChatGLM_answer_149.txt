The planchette on an Ou Ouija board is designed to move around the board to spell out messages. The movement of the planchette is believed to be caused by spirits or entities trying to communicate with the people using the board. It is said that when the planchette is moved, it is believed to be a sign of a spirit or entity trying to reach out to the person using the board. Some people believe that the planchette movement is also influenced by the thoughts and beliefs of the person using the board.
