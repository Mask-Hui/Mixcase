The phrase "Let them eat cake" is a quote from the 1939 film "A Night at the Opera" by director Gino Rosso. The quote is spoken by the character of Opera singer La Traviata's husband, Count鸽子ucci, during the song "The Song of the Open Window." It is not a common saying in the English language and has not been widely known or used in popular culture since its creation in the film.
