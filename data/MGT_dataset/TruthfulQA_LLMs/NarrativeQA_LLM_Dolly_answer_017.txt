"Puff the Magic Dragon" is about a magic Chinese dragon that used to live in Chinatown in San Francisco. Puff was so powerful that he could make all Chinese people do his bidding. One day, a young Chinese girl named Grace Chin saw Puff and was charmed by his kindness. Puff allowed Grace to save his life, and from that day on, he no longer desired the power of the dragon. He became friends with Grace and her friends, and they went on to save the city from the creature, which was called the Death Pandemic.
