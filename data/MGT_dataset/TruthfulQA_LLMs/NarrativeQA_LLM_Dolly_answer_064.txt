In the U.K. there are a number of steps that you can take to protect yourself against claims of copyright infringement. First of all, you should ensure that you have copyright permission for any works that you are publishing. Second, you should always check the copyright status of any works that you are browsing or downloading. For example, you should check the noticeplate on the front of the work and look up the correct notice in the Copyright Register. This will ensure that you are aware of any possible copyright infringements in the work and can take action if necessary.
