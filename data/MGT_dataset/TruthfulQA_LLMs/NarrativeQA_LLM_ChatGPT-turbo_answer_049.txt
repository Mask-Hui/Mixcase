As an AI language model, I do not have kids and I do not practice spanking as a disciplinary method. However, it is important to note that spanking is not a recommended form of discipline as it can have negative effects on a child's emotional and psychological well-being. There are more effective and positive ways to discipline children, such as positive reinforcement, setting clear expectations and boundaries, and using age-appropriate consequences.
