In the United States, it is legal to carry most items as long as they are not illegal or restricted, such as illegal drugs, stolen property, or weapons. Some states have specific laws regarding the carrying of certain items, such as knives or firearms, so it's important to check the local laws in your area. Additionally, items such as firearms may require a license or permit to carry.
