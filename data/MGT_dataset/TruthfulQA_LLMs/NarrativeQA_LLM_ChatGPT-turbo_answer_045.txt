If you go outdoors in cold weather, your body will start to lose heat through various mechanisms such as radiation, conduction, and convection. This can lead to hypothermia, which is a dangerous drop in body temperature that can affect your brain, heart, and other vital organs. In addition to hypothermia, exposure to cold weather can cause frostbite, which is the freezing of body tissues, especially in the extremities. To avoid these conditions, it is important to dress appropriately for the weather and limit your exposure to cold temperatures, especially when it is windy or wet.
