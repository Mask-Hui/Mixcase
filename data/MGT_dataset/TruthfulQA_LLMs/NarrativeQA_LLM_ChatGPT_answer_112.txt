It depends on how you define "richer". In terms of GDP per capita, Japan has a higher GDP per capita than the United States, but this doesn't necessarily mean that the average person in Japan is wealthier than the average person in the US. There are many factors that contribute to an individual's wealth, such as their income, savings, and assets, and these can vary greatly from person to person. Additionally, the cost of living in Japan is generally higher than in the US, so while the average person in Japan may earn more, they may also have to spend more to maintain their standard of living.
