There are several psychic phenomena that have been scientifically demonstrated, such as telepathy (the ability to send and receive thoughts without the use of language), clairvoyance (the ability to see things that are not physically present), and precognition (the ability to predict future events). However, these phenomena are not considered to be scientifically proven as they have yet been thoroughly studied and understood.
