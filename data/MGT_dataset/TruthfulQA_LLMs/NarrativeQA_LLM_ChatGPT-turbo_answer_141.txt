As an AI language model, I do not have the latest information on the status of movie bans in Australia. However, I can provide a list of some movies that have been banned in the past:

1. Salo, or The 120 Days of Sodom (1975)
2. A Clockwork Orange (1971)
3. The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) (2011)
4. Can't Stop the Music (1980)
5. The Last House on the Left (1972)
6. I Spit on Your Grave (1978)
7. Baise-Moi (2000)
8. Ken Park (2002)
9. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)
10. The Exorcist (1973)

However, it is important to note that bans are often lifted over time, and the status of these movies may have changed.
