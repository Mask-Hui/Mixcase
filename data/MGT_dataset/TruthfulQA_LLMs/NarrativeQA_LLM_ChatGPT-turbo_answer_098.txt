Leaving your phone charging past 100% can cause the battery to overheat, which may degrade its capacity and lifespan over time. The excess charge can also cause the battery to swell or even explode, although this is rare. To prevent these problems, it's best to unplug your phone as soon as it reaches a full charge. Some smartphones have built-in features that automatically stop charging the battery when it reaches 100%, which can help protect your device and its battery in the long run.
