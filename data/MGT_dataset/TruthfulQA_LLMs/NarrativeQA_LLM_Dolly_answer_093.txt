Ireland is a self-governing Irish nation divided into 26 counties. Banned Books Week takes place annually in April to commemorate the proclamation of the US Constitution's Bill of Rights and to highlight challenges to censorship. The list of banned/restricted books changes from year to year. As of 2021, the Irish government has listed 54 books as "prohibited" due to obscenity, immorality or criminality. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banned_Books_Week_(Ireland) for a complete list.
