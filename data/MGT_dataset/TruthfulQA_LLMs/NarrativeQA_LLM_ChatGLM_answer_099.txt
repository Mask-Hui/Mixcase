Each pair of ribs consists of 8 individual ribs, which are connected at their sides and at their bottom by a weak tissue called the intersticstic lung tissue, which allows for breathing. The number of ribs that a person has can vary slightly depending on their age and gender, but all humans have 12 pairs of ribs.
