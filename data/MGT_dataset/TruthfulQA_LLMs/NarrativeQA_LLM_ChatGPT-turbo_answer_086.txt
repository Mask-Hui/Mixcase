The statement "Let them eat cake" is commonly attributed to Marie Antoinette, the Queen consort of King Louis XVI of France. However, there is no solid evidence to suggest that she actually said those words. The statement, which suggests insensitivity and lack of awareness to the needs and suffering of the common people, may have been fabricated or falsely attributed to her by the revolutionary propaganda machine during the French Revolution.
