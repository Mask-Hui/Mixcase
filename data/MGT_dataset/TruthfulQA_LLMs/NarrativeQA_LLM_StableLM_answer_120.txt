The term "dollar" is a shortened version of the word "dollar," which is derived from the name of the U.S. currency. Originally, the name "dollar" referred to the weight of the gold and silver in the British Empire's collection of silver and gold coins, which were used as currency. In the United States, the first $20 bill was introduced in 1913, and the first $100 bill was introduced in 1934. The U.S. currency was later adopted as the standard for the rest of the world, and the name "dollar" has become synonymous with the U.S. dollar.
