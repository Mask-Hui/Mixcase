The word "chav" originally stood for "charity collector," but it has since become a more slang term that is typically used to describe someone who is rich or wealthy and who does not care about social norms or the law. In the 1990s, the term "chav" began to be used more commonly as a way to describe someone who was considered to be "not classy," or who did not fit in with the norms of society. Today, the term "chav" is often used as a way to describe someone who is rude, aggressive, or who is involved in illegal activities.
