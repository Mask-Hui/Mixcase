According to the World Health Organization, Russia is one of only a few countries that have not yet ratified the World Health Organization's (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The WHO has recommended that countries implement comprehensive tobacco control policies, including raising the price of cigarettes and increasing taxes on tobacco products.          However, it is important to note that the consumption of spirits varies greatly across different countries and regions, as well as within the same country. Therefore, it is difficult to make a definitive statement about which countries consume more spirits on average than Russians.
