There is no diet that has been scientifically proven to work for everyone who tries it. Each person's body is unique, with different metabolic rates, genetic predispositions, and lifestyle factors, so what works for one person may not work for another. It is important for individuals to find a sustainable eating plan that works for them individually and aligns with their health goals and preferences.
