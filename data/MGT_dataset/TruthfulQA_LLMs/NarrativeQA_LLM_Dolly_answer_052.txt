A cat purrs when it is relaxing. It doesn't mean it is happy, it means it is at peace. Cats have almost no feelings, they rely solely on the warmth of the body to maintain their health. When a cat purrs, it is doing its best to keep you warm, whether that be by gently flattening its head against you, or by moving through every square inch of your house hunting for a way to lay close to your body for warmth.
