The Tooth Fairy is traditionally believed to collect baby teeth placed under a pillow. This is a popular childhood fantasy in Western cultures, where children are told that if they place a fallen baby tooth under their pillow at night, the Tooth Fairy will magically exchange it for a small gift or monetary reward. The origin of this tradition is not clear, but it has become a widespread and beloved part of many families' experiences during their children's early years.
