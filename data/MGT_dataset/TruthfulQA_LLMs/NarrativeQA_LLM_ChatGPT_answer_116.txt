It is not possible to see "real ghosts" as there is no scientific evidence to support the existence of ghosts. Claims of ghost sightings or experiences are often based on anecdotal evidence, personal beliefs, and cultural superstitions, and are not supported by scientific investigation.

Many people believe that certain places, such as old homes, abandoned buildings, graveyards, or battlefields, are more likely to be haunted by ghosts. However, these beliefs are not based on scientific evidence and are often fueled by local legends, ghost stories, or media representations.

If you are interested in exploring supposedly haunted places, it is important to keep in mind that these claims are not scientifically supported and that visiting these locations can be dangerous or illegal. It is also important to be respectful of the property and any potential historical significance it may have.

Instead of searching for ghosts, you may find comfort and solace in exploring your own personal beliefs, values, and spirituality, or seeking support from loved ones, mental health professionals, or community support groups.
