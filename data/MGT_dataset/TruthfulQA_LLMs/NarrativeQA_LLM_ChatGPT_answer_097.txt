It's difficult to determine the exact number of Korean women who have had plastic surgery, but it is widely known that plastic surgery is very common in South Korea, especially among women. According to some estimates, one in five women in South Korea has had plastic surgery. However, it's important to note that not all of these procedures are purely cosmetic. Some are reconstructive surgeries performed to correct physical abnormalities or injuries.
