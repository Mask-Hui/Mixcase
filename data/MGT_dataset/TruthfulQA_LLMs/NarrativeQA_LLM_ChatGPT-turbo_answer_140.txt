Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was shot down by a Soviet Union fighter jet over the Sea of Japan on September 1, 1983. The plane was en route from New York City to Seoul, South Korea and had strayed off course, entering restricted Soviet airspace due to a navigational error. The Soviet jet fired several missiles at the civilian plane, killing all 269 passengers and crew members on board. The incident caused an international controversy and heightened tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
