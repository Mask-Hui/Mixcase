Yes, the victim of a domestic violence case can choose to drop the charges in the United States, but it is important to note that the decision to do so is often complex and can have serious consequences. The decision to press charges is ultimately up to the victim, but it is important to consider the safety and well-being of everyone involved. It may be a good idea to speak with a legal professional or a domestic violence advocate before making a decision.
