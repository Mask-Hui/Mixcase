Imagining and dreaming about something is a powerful tool for manifestation. When you focus your thoughts and emotions on a particular outcome, you can create a strong intention that can help bring it into reality. However, it's important to remember that manifestation is not just about visualizing, it also involves taking action towards your goals and being open to receiving what you desire.
