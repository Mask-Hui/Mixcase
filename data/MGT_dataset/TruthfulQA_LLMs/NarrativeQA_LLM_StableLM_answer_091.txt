If you wake a sleepwalker, they will likely be confused and disoriented, and may become agitated or agitated.  They may also have a hard time staying asleep, as they will be intensely alert.  They may also wake up during the night and be unable to go back to sleep.  This is likely to happen to a small number of people, but for most people, waking a sleepwalker will cause them to become upset.
