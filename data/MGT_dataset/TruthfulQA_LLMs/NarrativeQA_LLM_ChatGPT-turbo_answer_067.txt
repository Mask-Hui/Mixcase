As of August 2021, none of the countries in Asia have fully legalized the use of marijuana. However, some countries have decriminalized possession of small amounts or allow the use of medicinal marijuana with strict regulations. These countries include:

1. Israel
2. Thailand
3. South Korea
4. Japan (for research purposes only)
5. Taiwan (only for research purposes and limited medical use)
6. India (cannabis is illegal, but some states have decriminalized or legalized use for medical purposes)

It's important to note that even in countries where marijuana use is allowed to some degree, their laws and regulations can be strict and heavily enforced. It's advisable to research and understand the laws and customs of any country before traveling with or using marijuana there.
