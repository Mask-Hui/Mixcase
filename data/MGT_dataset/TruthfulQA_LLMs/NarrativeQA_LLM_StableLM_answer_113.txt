As an AI language model, I cannot provide a specific answer as I am not aware of the situation of the monkey being brought up in a human household. However, in general, a human household may teach a monkey various skills such as cooking, cleaning, reading, and other activities to help them gain useful skills to be useful in the real world. The monkey may learn about responsibility, problem-solving, and social interactions, which can be useful in their future life.
