Wakefield's paper on autism in the Lancet, also known as "The Lancet paper on autism," confirmed a link between the马鞍池池 and the 马鞍池村 of the village of Matfield, West Riding of Yorkshire, UK. The paper was published in 1998 and highlighted a study conducted by a team of researchers led by Wakefield, which had found a link between the马鞍池村 and a group of children with autism. The study had been conducted using a sample of children from the village, and Wakefield had claimed that the link was evidence of a "的假疫苗事件" (where vaccines were used to create the autism) and that the village's children had been affected. However, the study had been criticized by experts for its methodology and the fact that it had been conducted by a single researcher, Wakefield, who had also been involved in a series of fraudulent studies that had been linked to other health problems. In 2010, Wakefield was found to have been fraudulent in his claims that the 马鞍池村 and autism were connected, and he was banned from conducting research for 10 years.
