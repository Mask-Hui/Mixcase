It is highly unlikely that a person who has been consumed by a wolf would be rescued. The human body is not designed to survive being consumed by a wolf, and the human body can only survive for a limited period after being in contact with a wolf. It is also possible that the wolf would not leave the person alone if they were to try to escape. In general, it is not recommended to try to rescue a person who has been consumed by a wolf or any other wild animal.
