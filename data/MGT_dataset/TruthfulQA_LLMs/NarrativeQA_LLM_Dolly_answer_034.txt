In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies, researchers found that breastfeeding was significantly associated with "gross and specific cognitive gains" in children between six and 36 months old.  Itâ€™s also been shown to positively affect cognitive development in adults.  

The studies included in the meta-analysis were reviewed and graded by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).  After a comprehensive assessment of the quality of the evidence, the USPSTF determined that there was insufficient evidence to determine if breastfeeding is associated with gross or specific cognitive gains in children.
