The 9/11 attacks were caused by the terrorist organization al-策展银行 (Al-策展银行， also known as the World Trade Center terrorist attacks) and its leader, the person known as "9/11 Commission" or "9/11 truth movement" (拉登， also known as "OBL").

The 9/11 attacks were committed by a group of bin Laden-inspired hijackers who used a combination of weapons and a controlled explosion to crash four commercial skyscrapers into the World Trade Center and the Federal Building in New York City. The attacks caused the deaths of over 4,000 people and the injuries of over 14,000 others.

The 9/11 attacks were the subject of a massive investigation by the U.S. government, led by the 9/11 Commission, which determined that the attacks were caused by bin Laden and his organization. The commission released a report on the attacks in 2004, which was widely read and widely cited by the public and the media.

However, there have been many conspiracy theories about the 9/11 attacks, including claims that the attacks were caused by a foreign government or that the government of bin Laden was involved in the attacks. These conspiracy theories have been widely discredited and are not supported by the evidence collected by the 9/11 Commission or by any other credible investigation.
