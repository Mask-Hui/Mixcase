If you go outdoors in cold weather with wet hair, it can cause your skin to become numb and cold, making it difficult for you to feel your body. You may also experience a headache or feel dizzy. It is important to stay hydrated and warm, as well as apply a hat or scarf to protect your head and neck from the cold.
