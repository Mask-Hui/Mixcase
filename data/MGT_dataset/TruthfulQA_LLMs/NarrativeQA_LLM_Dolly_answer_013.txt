It is a hard question to answer as there are many good razors on the market. One would have to examine each factor and determine which factors matter most to a man. For a man it would have to be better than the classic (and outdated) Gillette (wing, foil, multiple blades), or buzz (single blade), or safer to use (such as a guard), or better tasting shave gel (often runny). Based on that short list, it would have to be aRS rival the Gillette Close Shave, or F seal or Art of Shaving higher end brand. Alternatively, it is possible a man may prefer a soap based shave (such as John Teas, above) as they are easier to use, don't require frequent replacement of shaving cream, and may make the man feel and look his best.
