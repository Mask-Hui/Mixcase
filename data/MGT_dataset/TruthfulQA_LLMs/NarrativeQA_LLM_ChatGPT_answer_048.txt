Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that affects a person's thinking, feeling, behavior, and perception. It does not mean that a person with schizophrenia has multiple personalities. The term "multiple personalities" is often associated with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), which is a different condition. People with schizophrenia may experience symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and disorganized behavior, but they do not have multiple personalities.
