In the US, it is illegal to wear specified clothing in the following places:  courtrooms, malls, airports, and in many other public spaces.  There are specific reasons given for this policy, but generally it is believed that certain clothing conveys a message of intimidation and fear to those who are innocent and a message of respect and dominance to those who are guilty.  That said, while it is generally illegal to wear certain kinds of clothing to these venues, there is no definitive list of clothing items that are illegal.  Many items of clothing which are prohibited have clear exceptions, such as work attire.  Some items of clothing which are prohibited are not clearly illegal, such as traditional Jewish clothing and some types of Muslim clothing.
