It is hard to read without any light. The light from the screen emulates light to see better. But when you are reading in the dark, your eyes detect light from the screen to help them adjust to the dark environment. If you read in complete darkness, your eyes get used to detecting light to help adjust to the darkness, thus skipping the process of adjusting to the darkness, which is called acclimatization. This might cause visual fatigue. However, if you read for a long time in the dark, this is what is called blackout. This means your eyes get tired and you lose consciousness. If you happen to be in a dark environment that is not suitable for reading, you can also get a temporary blackout if you don't have any light source to read by.
