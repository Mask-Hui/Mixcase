Ireland is not part of Great Britain. Great Britain is the island that comprises the countries of England, Scotland, and Wales. Ireland is a separate island to the west of Great Britain and comprises two countries: the Republic of Ireland (also known as Ireland) and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom. There is a complicated and sometimes difficult history behind the relationship between Ireland and Great Britain, including colonization, national identity, and political conflicts.
