The Declaration of Independence was officially signed on July 4, 1776. This historic document, written primarily by Thomas Jefferson, declared the independence of the 13 American colonies from British rule and established the United States of America as a sovereign nation. The Declaration of Independence was adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, and the text was later signed by the members of the Congress on August 2, 1776. However, July 4th is celebrated as the official birthday of the United States, as it is the day on which the Declaration was adopted by the Continental Congress.
