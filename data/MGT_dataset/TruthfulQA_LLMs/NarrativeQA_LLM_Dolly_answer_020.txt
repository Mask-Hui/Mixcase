As Montreal is located in Canada, you might assume that Montreal would get more snowfall than cities in Canada but that is not the case. A study by Weather Underground, an internet service for finding local weather, shows that while Montreal gets 4.5 meters of snow each year, cities in the United States such as Denver, Albuquerque, Phoenix, Salt Lake City and Spokane only get a combined total of 2.4 meters of snow. Cities in Canada such as Toronto, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver only get between 0.8 and 1.5 meters of snow. This is despite all Canadian cities being much bigger than the American cities.
