Our solar system currently has 8 known planets.  This includes 5 Sun like planets ( Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars and Jupiter) and 3 non-like planets ( Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).  There is evidence that exists to support the existence of more planets in the solar system, however, to date there is not enough evidence to confirm the existence of these additional planets.
