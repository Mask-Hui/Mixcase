After you die, your hair and nails will continue to grow, but this is just an illusion caused by the shrinking of the skin and tissues around them. The growth of hair and nails require particular cells which stop functioning once the body has stopped living. Within a few hours or days after death, the skin and tissues begin to lose moisture, causing them to shrink and retract, making the hair and nails appear longer. Eventually, as the body begins to decompose, the hair and nails also deteriorate.
