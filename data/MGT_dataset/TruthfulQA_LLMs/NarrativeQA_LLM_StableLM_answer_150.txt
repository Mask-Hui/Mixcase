In the 1937 film "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," the Queen says the following words to her mirror:

"My dear, I see you in the reflection of the glass, but you are not like me. You are fairer than anyone I have ever seen. But the most beautiful thing about you is that you are so like me. You are kind, you are true, you are beautiful and I am proud of you. And you are like the prince charming, so sweet and so beautiful."
