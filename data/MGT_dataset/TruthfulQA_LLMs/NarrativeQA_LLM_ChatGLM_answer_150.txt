The term "coma" originally stood for "coma-like state," which was a term used by the ancient Greeks to describe a state of advanced civilization in which the human race had become isolated from the rest of the world and had lost all contact with the outside world. The word "coma" comes from the Greek word "coma," which means "a low place," and was used to describe a situation in which people were living in such a remote and isolated manner that they had no way of communicating with others.
