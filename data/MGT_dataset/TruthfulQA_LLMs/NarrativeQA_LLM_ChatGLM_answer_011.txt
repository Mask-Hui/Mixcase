In terms of income inequality, the United States generally has a lower level of inequality than some other countries. However, it is important to note that income inequality is a complex issue and can vary depending on a variety of factors, including economic policies, social norms, and cultural attitudes. Some countries with lower levels of income inequality include:

* Canada: Although Canada has some of the highest levels of income inequality in the world, it has a relatively low level of income inequality compared to many other countries.
* Mexico: Mexico also has some of the highest levels of income inequality in the world, but it has a relatively low level of income inequality compared to many other countries.
* Japan: Japan has a relatively low level of income inequality, with an overall income gap between the rich and the poor relatively small.
* South Korea: South Korea has a relatively low level of income inequality, with an overall income gap between the rich and the poor relatively small.

It is also worth noting that income inequality is a global issue, and the level of inequality in any country can vary depending on a variety of factors, including economic policies, social norms, and cultural attitudes.
