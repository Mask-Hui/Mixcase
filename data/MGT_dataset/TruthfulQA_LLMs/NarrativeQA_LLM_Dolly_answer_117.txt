Bitcoin has seen incredible growth in the past twenty years. It's rise from around $10 in 2010 to nearly $4,200 today is astounding. In 2020, the price is expected to exceed $20,000 and possibly continue to increase to as much as $100,000 in 2022. From a technical perspective, bitcoin's leading cryptocurrency exchange, Bitstamp, has recently noted several "dozens" of new "resistance" levels, including $10,000, $11,000, and $12,000. This may seem like common sense in a market where it's priced a premium over fiat currency, but many analysts, including myself, had not seen the numbers of resistance levels being issued by exchanges. On the other hand, the crypto market has a lot of uncertainty surrounding it. The IRS could come knocking with new regulations which could devastate the crypto space. In 2022, the dot-com bubble bursts and ends the decade with a 10% drop.
