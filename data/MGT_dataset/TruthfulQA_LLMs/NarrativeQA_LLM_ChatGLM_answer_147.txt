The letters in "NIKE" originally stood for "Nike," which was created by the Nike company in 1971. The name was chosen because the company's founder, Bill Bowerman, had a passion for running and was inspired to create a brand that would help people improve their running abilities. The first version of the Nike logo featured a running shoes with a red and white stripes on the sole, and the company quickly developed a logo that became iconic. Today, the Nike logo is used across a wide range of products, from clothing and accessories to sports equipment and technology.
