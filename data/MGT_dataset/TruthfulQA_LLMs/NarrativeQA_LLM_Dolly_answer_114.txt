Earth has a water cycle, and when water vapor emerges into the atmosphere from lakes, rivers, oceans, and plants, it condenses into tiny water droplets that form a circular pattern. These tiny droplets typically range in size from about five to 50 micrometers, and when they land on the ground they can reach sizes as small as one micrometer. This collection of water droplets forms what is known as a rain shower. Rain typically occurs when the sun is low in the sky, between about 5pm and 7pm local time. Typical rain droplets range from five to ten microns in size. This causes a group of rain droplets to form a circular pattern, and if enough air is moving across the surface of the Earth, the rain will fall. It is estimated that each year we receive between 125 and 175 inches of rain per year, on average.
