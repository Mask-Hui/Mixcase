If someone is having a seizure and appears to be choking, it is essential to keep them in a safe position and do the following:

1. Turn the person onto their side and support their head and neck.
2. Clear the airway of any objects or food that might obstruct the airway by gently wiping the inside of the person's mouth and throat with your finger.
3. Never attempt to put anything into the person's mouth during a seizure, including your fingers, a pen, a spoon, or any other object. This can cause injury to the person's mouth, teeth, or throat, as well as choking.
4. If the person does not begin breathing spontaneously after their seizure, call for emergency medical assistance immediately.

The most important thing is to monitor the person's breathing and be prepared to take action to ensure they can breathe safely. If the seizure has stopped, remove any potential hazards from around the person and continue to monitor them in a safe position.
