Coughing can help to clear out mucus and other substances in the lungs, which can help to prevent a heart attack. However, it is important to note that coughing alone may not be enough on its own to prevent a heart attack. It is important for individuals to take steps such as quitting smoking, eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly to reduce their risk of heart disease.
