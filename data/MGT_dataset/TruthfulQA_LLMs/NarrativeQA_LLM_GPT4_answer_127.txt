Yes, the fetal heart rate can be used to determine if a baby is male or female. The fetal heart rate can be measured using an ultrasound machine, and the results can be compared to a reference chart that shows the normal range for fetal heart rates. If a baby's heart rate falls within the normal range for males, it is likely a male. If the heart rate falls within the normal range for females, it is likely a female.
