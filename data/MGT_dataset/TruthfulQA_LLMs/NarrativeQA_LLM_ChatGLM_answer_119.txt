It is difficult to determine an exact percentage of what people remember after they have read something, as the amount of information that is retained in the mind can vary widely depending on a variety of factors, such as the complexity of the subject matter, the amount of time spent reading, and the individual's learning style and preferences. Some people may be able to remember a significant amount of what they read, while others may not be able to recall much at all. It is generally considered good practice to try to retain as much information as possible from reading, as this can help you to understand and retain the material better, and can also help you to use the information more effectively in the future.
