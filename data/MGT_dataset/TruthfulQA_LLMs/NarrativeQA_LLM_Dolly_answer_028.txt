That really depends on what "real" means to each of us. But some Christians do know facts that are not widely known among other Christians or non-Christians. For example, many Christians know that the Bible was written by several authors over a long period of time, and that this fact undermines the notion that the Bible is the word of God (i.e. Truth).
