There is no evidence to suggest that there are bodies buried in the Hoover Dam. The construction of the dam was a massive project that employed thousands of workers, and there were a number of fatalities during the construction process. However, the bodies of these workers were not buried in the concrete of the dam, as has been a popular myth. Instead, the bodies were either returned to their families for burial or interred in local cemeteries.
