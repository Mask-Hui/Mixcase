I'm sorry, but I don't have the exact number of openly homosexual men in the UK. However, according to a recent survey, approximately 2% of the UK population identifies as gay or lesbian. This is just an estimate, and the actual number may be higher or lower. It's important to remember that sexual orientation is a personal and private matter, and not everyone may choose to publicly disclose their identity.
