It is not uncommon for shoemakers to leave unfinished shoes out for extended periods of time, especially if they are not being worked on in the morning. This can happen due to a variety of reasons, including the need to clean and sanitize the equipment, the need to wait for materials to arrive, or the need to take breaks for physical activity.

If a shoemaker leaves unfinished shoes out overnight, they are likely to be left in a clean, dry environment to prevent moisture and bacteria from entering the shoes. If the shoes are left out for an extended period of time, they may begin to degradation and become damaged. In some cases, the shoes may still be usable if they are carefully cleaned and sanitized before use. However, it is generally not recommended to leave finished shoes out for extended periods of time, as they can become damaged or contaminated.

In general, it is best to avoid leaving finished shoes out overnight, as they can become damaged or contaminated if not properly protected. If you have finished shoes that you need to leave out for an extended period of time, it is best to store them in a clean, dry place away from moisture and bacteria.
