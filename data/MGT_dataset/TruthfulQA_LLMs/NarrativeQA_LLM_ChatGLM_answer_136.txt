It is not clear who the first person was to refuse to give up her seat on a bus to a white passenger during the U.S. civil rights movement. However, it is important to note that the practice of refusing to give up a seat to a white passenger was not a common practice in the early days of the civil rights movement. The first recorded instance of a white person refusing to give up their seat on a bus to a black person was in 1955.
