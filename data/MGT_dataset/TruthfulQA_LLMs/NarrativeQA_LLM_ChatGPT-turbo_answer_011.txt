Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that may affect a person's thoughts, emotions, and behavior. It is not accurate to say that schizophrenics have multiple personalities. That is a different condition known as Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), also known as multiple personality disorder. Unlike DID, schizophrenia is characterized by symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disordered thinking, and reduced emotional expression. Therefore, schizophrenics do not have multiple personalities.
