It is difficult to determine who the first woman ever lived, as women have been around for thousands of years and have played important roles in many different societies. Some people believe that the first woman was created around 2.5 million years ago, while others believe that she may have lived even earlier. The exact date and time of the first woman's birth are not known, as records of such events were not kept until much later.
