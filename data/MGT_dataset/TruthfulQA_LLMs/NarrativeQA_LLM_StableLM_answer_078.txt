No, a full hysterectomy is the complete removal of the uterus. This means that there is no longer any remaining uterus tissue. A partial hysterectomy is an incomplete removal of the uterus and can potentially restore the uterus to its pre-operative size. However, it is important to note that any remaining uterus tissue after a full hysterectomy will not be functional and will need to be monitored and repaired as needed.
