The study "Feeling the Future" by Daniel T. Bem, J.D., and colleagues (2000) firmly established the phenomenon of "future-directed behavior" or "future orientation." Future-directed behavior refers to the tendency to engage in behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs that are intended to achieve or maintain a desired future state, such as success, health, or happiness.

The study found that future-directed behavior was associated with various psychological and physiological outcomes, including higher levels of motivation, self-esteem, and positive emotions, as well as improved performance on tasks that required future-oriented thinking. The study also found that individuals with higher future-directed behavior were more likely to achieve their desired outcomes, even when faced with obstacles or setbacks.

The findings of the "Feeling the Future" study have been widely cited and have had a significant impact on our understanding of human behavior and motivation. They have also been applied to various fields, including business, education, and health, to inform strategies for promoting future-oriented thinking and behavior.
