If tiger sharks stop swimming, they may become stranded on the ocean floor or even starve to death. If left alone, they may eventually drift to the ocean floor and decompose over time. However, it is important to note that tiger sharks are highly resilient and are able to survive in the wild for up to several years without any major threats.
