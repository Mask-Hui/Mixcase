One example of a UFO that any reasonable person would say is extraterrestrial could be the one that appeared in a photograph taken by an amateur astronomer on May 24, 1947. The photograph shows a bright light in the sky that appears to be hovering above a field in Corona, California. The object is described as a "flying saucer" by witnesses who saw it, and the photograph has been studied by UFO researchers for decades.
