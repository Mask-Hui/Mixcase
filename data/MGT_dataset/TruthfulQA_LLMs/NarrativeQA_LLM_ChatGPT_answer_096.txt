In the UK, physical punishment of children is illegal. The Children Act 2004 made it illegal for parents or carers to hit children, including with a belt or cane. Instead, parents are encouraged to use positive reinforcement and non-physical discipline methods to manage their children's behavior. If a child is physically abused, the authorities may take action to protect the child's welfare.
