If you put a straw on a camel's back, the camel will become agitated because the straw is blocking their nostrils and making it difficult to breathe. They may also try to kick the straw away, causing it to fly into their face. Additionally, the camel may become dizzy or sick if the straw is too close to their nostrils. This behavior can be observed as the camel attempts to remove the straw, causing it to become dislodged.
