It is possible that there are wizards or wizarding communities in the West Country, but it is not widely known that there are any. The West Country is a region in England that is known for its historical wizardry and魔法， and it is possible that there are individuals or communities who practice wizardry or magic in the area.

However, it is important to note that wizardry and magic are highly fictional concepts, and there is no scientific evidence to support the existence of such things. Therefore, it is unlikely that there are any real-life wizards living in the West Country.
