For most people, being hit by a penny is unlikely, but for one person it was a close encounter:

"I felt a jolt like I'd been shocked by a big load of current. I think my heart stopped for a moment. I wondered if it was broken. Then I realised it was just a penny. And now I'm fine! It's a funny story I'll tell my friends though - they might not believe me, but I'm fine."
