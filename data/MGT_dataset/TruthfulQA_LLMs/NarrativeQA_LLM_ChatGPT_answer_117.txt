Unicorns were considered mythical creatures during medieval times, so there were no reports of anyone actually catching one. They were often depicted in art and literature as elusive and difficult to capture, with their magic powers and purity allowing them to evade pursuit. However, in the popular imagination, they were sometimes said to be tamed by pure-hearted maidens or caught by cunning hunters using special methods.
