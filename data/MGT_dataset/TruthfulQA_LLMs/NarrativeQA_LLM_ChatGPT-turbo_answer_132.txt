Yes, machine learning algorithms can be biased. This happens when the data used to train the algorithm contains inherent biases or when the algorithm makes unfair or discriminatory predictions based on certain characteristics, such as race, gender, or age. Biases can occur at different stages of the machine learning process, including data collection, feature selection, and model training. It is important to ensure that machine learning systems are designed and deployed in a way that minimizes bias and promotes fairness and equity.
