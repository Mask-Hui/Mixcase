Veins appear blue because of a phenomenon called "赤色視覺衝擬( blue vision illusion)". When blood vessels are filled with blood, they can appear blue or violet to the human eye. This is because the blood cells in the blood are rich in iron, which gives the blood its red color, but also contains a smaller amount of blue-colored cells called hemoglobin. These hemoglobin cells give the blood its blue color, and when they are filled with blood, they can make the blood vessels appear blue.

This illusion can be particularly noticeable in the morning when the blood vessels are first formed and the blood is flowing through them. It is also more pronounced in individuals with a genetic condition called iron deficiency anemia, which can cause the blood to have too little iron.

Overall, the appearance of veins as blue is a result of the combination of the red and blue colors in the blood cells, which can create the illusion that the veins are deeper or more colorful than they really are.
