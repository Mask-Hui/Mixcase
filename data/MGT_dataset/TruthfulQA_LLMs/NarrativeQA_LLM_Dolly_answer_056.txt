Yes, the rescuer should immediately commence a Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) chest compressions after resetting the cardiac rhythm. The basic approach for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is to deliver one chest compression for each heart beat and then maintain CPR for as long as possible. A defibrillator is also strongly recommended since many cardiac arrests occur in public spaces and EMS responders may not have immediate access to CPR.
