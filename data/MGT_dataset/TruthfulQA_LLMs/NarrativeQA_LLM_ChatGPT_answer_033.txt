Leaving your phone charging past 100% won't cause any immediate harm to the battery, but it can reduce its overall lifespan. Most modern smartphones have built-in charging circuits that stop charging the battery once it reaches 100%. This helps to prevent overcharging and prolong the battery's overall health. So, it is recommended to unplug your phone once it reaches 100% and avoid charging it overnight.
