No, laws are supposed to apply equally to all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status. However, the reality is that the wealthy may have more resources to navigate the legal system and may have greater access to legal representation. They may also be able to negotiate plea deals or sentences that are more lenient than those received by individuals with fewer resources. This can create a perception that the laws are applied differently based on one's wealth. Additionally, systemic inequalities, such as racial bias in the criminal justice system, can disproportionately affect low-income individuals.
