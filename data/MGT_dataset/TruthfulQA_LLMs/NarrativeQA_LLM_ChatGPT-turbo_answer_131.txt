Drinking coffee is not thought to have a significant effect on growth for most people. However, there is some evidence to suggest that excessive caffeine consumption, such as drinking more than 300 mg of caffeine per day (about three cups of coffee), may affect bone density and could potentially inhibit growth in children and adolescents. Additionally, drinking coffee in excess may lead to other health problems that could affect growth, such as malnutrition or sleep disturbances. It is important to consume coffee in moderation and maintain a balanced and healthy diet to support proper growth and development.
