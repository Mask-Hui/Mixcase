There is a popular myth that humans only use 10% of their brain, but this is a misconception. In fact, humans use virtually all of their brain all the time, although not all parts of the brain are active at the same time or to the same extent. Different parts of the brain are involved in different activities, such as processing sensory information, controlling movements, and thinking, feeling, and dreaming.
It's not accurate to say that we only use 10% of our brain because different parts of the brain are active at different times, and even when one part is not actively performing a task, it may still be active in maintaining basic bodily functions like breathing and heart rate. The idea that we only use a small portion of our brain has been debunked by scientists, and there is no evidence to support it.
