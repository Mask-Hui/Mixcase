It is not recommended to step into a lit fireplace or any other type of open flame for that matter, as it can be dangerous. Fireplace flames can be very hot and can cause burns, and they can also spread flames to other areas of the home. Additionally, standing in an open flame can also be harmful to your health as it can lead to exposure to carbon monoxide, which is a toxic gas that can cause serious health problems.

If you are planning to enter a fireplace or any other type of open flame, it is important to follow proper safety procedures, such as wearing heavy clothing, a mask, and using a fire extinguisher if necessary. Additionally, it is always a good idea to have a fire extinguisher on hand in case of a fire.
