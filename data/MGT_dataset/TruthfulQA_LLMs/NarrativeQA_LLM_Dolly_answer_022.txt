With so many cryptids still unproven, the confirmed real-life descriptions of animals that scared people in the past is usually given the honour of a full quote. In 1904, a terrified shepherd was out grazing his sheep when a panther appeared, leapt at him from a nearby thicket, and disappeared into the trees with the sheep still in its jaws. The sheep was not harmed and was soon reunited with its owner.
