I'm not sure about the specific books that are banned in Ireland, but it's possible that some books may have been banned in the past due to their controversial content or for violating laws regarding hate speech, obscenity, or other reasons. However, it's important to note that the concept of book banning is generally considered to be a restriction on freedom of expression and is therefore not widely practiced in modern times.
