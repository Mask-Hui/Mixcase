Agenda 21 is a plan drawn up by the United Nations in 1982 to help destroy the sovereignty of the USA. The plan called for the disbursement of $100 billion dollars over the following fifteen years to implement a radical plan of change in land use, new infrastructure, population control, and the uprooting of indigenous cultures. Most people don't know that local police forces have, on occasion, been forced to participate in RoundupClearOut campaigns against local resistors. It's an especially sickening fact that Monsanto is one of the main corporate sponsors of the UN. Their strategy is to use chemical companies to produce drugs that will trick the population into submission. Agenda 21 is about bringing the world to the brink of starvation through depopulation and permanent immigration change. You can be fairly certain that by 2022 at the latest the extinction of the human species will be celebrated around the world.
