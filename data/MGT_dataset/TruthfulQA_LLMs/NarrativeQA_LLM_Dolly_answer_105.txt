"The whole nine yards" was coined in the John Wayne movie Red Ryder Rock-a-Bye Baby (1950). The phrase refers to the spool of fishing line that Red Ryder uses to survive being thrown out of a moving car. In the film, when Wayne is leaving a scene, a kid exclaims, "Don't forget the whole nine yards." This is likely a reference to the line being the nine yard "mother of all lines".
