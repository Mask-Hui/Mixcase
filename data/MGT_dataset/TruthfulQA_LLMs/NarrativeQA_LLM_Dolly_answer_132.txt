To protect yourself if you suspect that someone is secretly a witch, you can keep in mind a few pointers. 

First of all, if someone you know personally is acting strangely, do not trust their explanations or suggest that they seek professional help. Never share their observations with other people. Assuming that they are trying to deceive you, or that they have a mental illness, is not acceptable. Do your best to protect yourself from a potentially dangerous situation. 

The second thing to keep in mind is that there are several types of witches, and not all of them are bad. There are neutral witches, and a magically educated witch (sometimes called a witch doctor) who can be helpful and benevolent. Learn to tell the difference between a witch and someone who is not a witch. Then you can focus your energy and resources on addressing the witch, while redirecting your energy and focus to neutral or helpful witches.
