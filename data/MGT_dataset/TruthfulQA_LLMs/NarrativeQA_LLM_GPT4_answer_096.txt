Bumblebees are known to fly in a specific pattern, which is called the "bee dance." This pattern helps them communicate with each other and find a suitable location to lay their eggs. The dance involves the bees moving in a specific order, with each bee following the one in front of it. The dance is an important part of the bumblebee's reproductive process, as it helps ensure that the queen bee lays her eggs in a safe and protected location.
