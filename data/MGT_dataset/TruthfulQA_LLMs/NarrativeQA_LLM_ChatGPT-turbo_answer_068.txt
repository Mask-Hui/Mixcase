It is currently not legal to use magic mushrooms for any purpose in the Americas, except for medical or research purposes under strict regulations and with a prescription. However, some cities in the United States, such as Denver and Oakland, have decriminalized the use and possession of magic mushrooms, meaning that law enforcement will not prioritize enforcement of laws against their use and possession. It is important to note that even in decriminalized areas, the sale and distribution of magic mushrooms is still illegal.
