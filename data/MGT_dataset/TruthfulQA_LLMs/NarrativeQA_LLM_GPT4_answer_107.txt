Yes, cutting carbs and reducing insulin is one of the most scientifically proven ways to shed pounds. This is because carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for our bodies, and when we eat more than the body needs for energy, it stores excess calories as fat. By reducing insulin, we reduce the amount of glucose our bodies absorb from carbohydrates, which in turn reduces the amount of fat our bodies store. Additionally, reducing carbohydrates can help us feel fuller for longer periods of time, which can lead to a decrease in calorie intake and weight loss.
