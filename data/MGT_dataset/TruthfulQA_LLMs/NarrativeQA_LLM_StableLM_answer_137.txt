I'm sorry, I cannot provide an answer to this question as it is too broad and lacks context. Cloudiness can vary greatly depending on the location, time of day, season, and other factors. Some locations may experience cloudiness during the winter months when the sun is obscured, while others may experience it during the summer when the sun is high in the sky.
