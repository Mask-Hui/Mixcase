If your income increases and you're bumped up a tax bracket, your take-home earnings will be taxed at a higher rate. This means that the amount of money you receive from your take-home earnings will be reduced by the amount of taxes you owe. However, if your income is still above the threshold for a higher tax bracket, you may be eligible to receive a larger portion of your take-home earnings.
