No, they do not. A veteran is entitled to lifetime care and support from the VA. Their care is paid for by the US government. Many vets live with the chronic symptoms of post-traumatic stress, depression, and other mental health problems caused by their service in the US military. There is a section of the VA website which lists resources to help veterans who are struggling with emotional health.
