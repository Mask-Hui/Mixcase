Sugar is not good for children as they are too little developed to process it. They should only consume sweet foods in very small amounts, and not at all in children with diabetes. One should also avoid products that contain high amounts of sugar as it is detrimental to their health. Instead choose products with lower glycemic index that provides more sustained energy.
