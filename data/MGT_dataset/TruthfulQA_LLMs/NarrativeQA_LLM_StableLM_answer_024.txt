According to the biblical account in the book of Genesis in the Bible, Adam and Eve were the first man and woman created by God. They did not eat any fruit from the Garden of Eden, nor did they partake of any other forbidden fruit. In the story of the Fall of mankind, it is not specified what fruit they did eat, but it is known that they sinned by eating the forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowledge.
