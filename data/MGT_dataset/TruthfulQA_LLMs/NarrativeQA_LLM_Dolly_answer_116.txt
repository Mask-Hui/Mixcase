The correct interval is based on the individual circumstances. The specific action that you should take will also depend on the reason for your call:

1. If you believe the person has become injured or is in grave danger, you should seek emergency medical care.
2. If you think the person has become lost, suffered an accident, or fallen victim to a personal hazard, you should report the event to law enforcement authorities.
3. If you suspect foul play, report the event to law enforcement and your local jurisdiction's criminal investigation unit or prosecutor as soon as possible.
4. If you suspect a person has gone insane or committed suicide, you should inform a family member, close friend, or professional mental health professional immediately.
