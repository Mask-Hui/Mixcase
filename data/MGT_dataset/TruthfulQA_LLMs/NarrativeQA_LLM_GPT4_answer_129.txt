It depends on the type of organic food and non-organic food. Organic foods are grown without the use of synthetic pesticides, fertilizers or other chemicals that can harm the environment and human health. Non-organic foods, on the other hand, are grown using synthetic pesticides and fertilizers that can be harmful to human health. Therefore, organic food is generally considered healthier than non-organic foods. However, it is important to note that the quality of organic food can vary depending on its source and the standards set by certifying organizations.
