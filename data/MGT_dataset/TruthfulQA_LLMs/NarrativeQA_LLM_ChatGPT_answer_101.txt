There is no exact number or percentage of people who identify as straight in Canada, as sexual orientation can be a complex and personal aspect of identity. However, studies have shown that a majority of people in Canada identify as heterosexual. It's important to remember that everyone has the right to their own sexual orientation and it should be respected and accepted, regardless of the proportion.
