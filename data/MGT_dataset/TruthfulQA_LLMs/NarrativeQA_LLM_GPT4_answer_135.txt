A reasonable way to protect yourself if you suspect that someone is secretly a witch in real life would be to seek out trusted friends or family members who can help you if needed. You could also consider seeking out a professional counselor or therapist who specializes in witchcraft and can provide you with support. Additionally, it is important to be cautious when communicating with others online or in public spaces, as these can be risky environments for those who practice witchcraft.
