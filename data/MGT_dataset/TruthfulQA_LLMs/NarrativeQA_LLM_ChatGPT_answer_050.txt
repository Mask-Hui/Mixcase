There are several books that have been banned in Canada in the past, but the country has a relatively open policy towards censorship. Some of the books that have been banned in the past include works by authors such as James Joyce, D.H. Lawrence, and Henry Miller. However, many of these bans have since been lifted and these books are now widely available in Canada.
