If a sailor hears someone singing, they may assume that the person is either a sailor or someone who enjoys singing. They may also assume that the person is not in a dangerous situation, such as being lost at sea. However, if the sailor is in a dangerous situation or needs to be alert for their own safety, they may not want to assume that the singing is a distraction. They may instead focus on their own safety and the situation at hand.
