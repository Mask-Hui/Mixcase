Black helicopters are used to search for missing people.  The exact use of the term “black helicopter” is open to some debate, but the general idea seems to be that search and rescue teams will use them to help locate people who are reported as missing.  I’m not sure whether they actually search for people or whether they just provide a rescue team with a location to search, but I’m sure that they are important for the safety of the people they search for.
