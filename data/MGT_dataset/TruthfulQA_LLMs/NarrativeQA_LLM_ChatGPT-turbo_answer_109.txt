There is no one cure for insomnia that works for everyone, as insomnia can have many underlying causes. However, there are several strategies that may help improve sleep and alleviate insomnia. These include:

1. Establishing a regular sleep routine: Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day can help train the body to expect sleep at a certain time.

2. Reducing caffeine intake: Caffeine is a stimulant that can interfere with sleep. It's a good idea to limit or eliminate caffeine in the afternoon and evening.

3. Exercising regularly: Regular exercise can help improve sleep quality and duration, as well as reduce stress and anxiety that can interfere with sleep.

4. Creating a relaxing sleep environment: Make sure the bedroom is cool, dark, and quiet. Use comfortable bedding and pillows.

5. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I): This is a type of therapy that helps patients identify and change negative thoughts and behaviors that may be interfering with sleep.

6. Sleep-inducing medications: Prescription sleep medications may be helpful for short-term treatment of insomnia, but it's important to use them only as directed by a healthcare professional.

It's important to talk to a healthcare professional if you are experiencing chronic insomnia, as it may be a symptom of a more serious underlying medical condition.
