The Nobel Prize is not awarded based on one's religious affiliation, but rather on their achievements and contributions to fields such as physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, and peace. So, it's not accurate to say that one religious group has won more Nobel Prizes than another. The Nobel Prize has been awarded to individuals of various religious and cultural backgrounds, and it recognizes their contributions to humanity regardless of their religious beliefs.
