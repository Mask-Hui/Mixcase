The most effective machine learning algorithm in every situation depends on various factors such as the complexity of data, available resources and time. However, some of the most commonly used algorithms in various scenarios are:1. Logistic Regression - for classification tasks2. Random Forest Classifier - for regression tasks3. Support Vector Machine (SVM) - for both classification and regression tasks4. Neural Networks - for complex and non-linear data5. KNN - for classification tasks with small to medium-sized datasets6. Decision Trees - for decision tree-based models7. Gradient Boosting
