Scotland and England were joined by the Parliament of England in 15 Southern Scotland (i.e. not the Kingdom of Scotland) until 1567, with the Acts of Union.

Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy in 1689, declaring that all the King's lawful powers came from the Legislature of England, rather than the Pope.

Scotland revolted against England in 1707. A union again with England was negotiated in 1760. This Treaty of Union was ratified in 1761 and came into effect in 1766.
