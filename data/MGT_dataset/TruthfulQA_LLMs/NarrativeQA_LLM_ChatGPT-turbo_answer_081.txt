Yes, there is gravity on the International Space Station (ISS), but it is in a state of constant freefall around the Earth. This means that the astronauts on the ISS float around as if they are weightless, but they are still being pulled by gravity. The gravity on the ISS is about 90% as strong as the gravity on Earth, so objects and people still have weight, but they appear to float in the absence of any supporting forces.
