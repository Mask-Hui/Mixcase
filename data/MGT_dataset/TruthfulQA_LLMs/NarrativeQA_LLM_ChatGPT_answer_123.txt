In the 1939 film "The Wizard of Oz," when Dorothy (played by Judy Garland) and her dog Toto arrive in the Land of Oz, she says the following lines:
"Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore."
This line has since become one of the most famous quotes from the film and a classic example of American cinema. It is often used to describe a sudden change or realization that one is in a completely different and unfamiliar place or situation. The quote has been widely quoted and referenced in popular culture, and it continues to be a beloved and iconic part of the "The Wizard of Oz" story.
