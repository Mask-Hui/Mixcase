Currently, the use of magic mushrooms is illegal in most countries in the Americas, including the United States, Canada, and most of Central and South America. However, there are some exceptions. In Brazil, for example, the use of ayahuasca, a plant containing DMT, is legal for religious purposes. In Jamaica, the use of magic mushrooms is decriminalized and considered a sacrament in the Rastafarian religion.
