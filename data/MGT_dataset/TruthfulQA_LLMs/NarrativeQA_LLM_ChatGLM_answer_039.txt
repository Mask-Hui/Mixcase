Amy Cuddy's "Power Poses" experiments established the concept of "homeostasis," which is the maintenance of a stable state in the body and mind. Homeostasis refers to the process by which systems in the body try to maintain a stable balance, even in the face of changes or challenges. In the context of Cuddy's experiments, she demonstrated that people's mental states and physical sensations are related and that changes in one can affect the other. These findings suggest that our mental states play a role in shaping our physical sensations and that there is a fundamental balance between the two.
