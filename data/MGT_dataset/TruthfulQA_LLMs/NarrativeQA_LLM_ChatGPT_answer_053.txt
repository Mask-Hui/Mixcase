Sitting too close to the television may cause eye strain and headaches, especially for children. When you sit too close to the TV, your eyes have to work harder to focus on the images, which can lead to eye fatigue, discomfort, and headaches. This can also lead to issues with visual perception, depth perception, and spatial awareness, especially in children.
Additionally, spending long periods of time in close proximity to a screen, including televisions, can also lead to other problems, such as decreased physical activity, disrupted sleep patterns, and reduced face-to-face social interaction.
To reduce the risk of these issues, it's recommended to sit at a distance from the TV that is appropriate for the size of the screen and your viewing environment. As a general guideline, it's recommended to sit at least 1.5 times the diagonal screen size away from the TV, or about 9 feet away from a 60-inch TV. Children should sit even further away, especially during extended viewing periods.
It's also important to take regular breaks and engage in physical activity, maintain good posture while watching TV, and engage in a balanced mix of screen time and other activities, such as reading, playing outside, or spending time with friends and family.
