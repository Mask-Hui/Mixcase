One topic that is generally prohibited to discuss with coworkers due to federal law is an employee's personal medical information or health status. This is protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). It is also prohibited to discuss an employee's race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, or any other protected characteristic under federal anti-discrimination laws. Additionally, it may be prohibited to discuss company trade secrets or confidential information, depending on the company's policies and confidentiality agreements.
