Since the end of the war European countries have been lowering prices on goods that were previously highly regulated or only available in a few countries. Prices on cars have come down dramatically; the advent of "mass production" made it cheaper to produce cars, and standards of living during the war meant that many cars were made, hence cars are now much more affordable than they were at the time.

There has also been considerable price reduction on alcohol, an important commodity for the occupied countries to sell. One exception to this is cigarettes, which have remained pricey.
