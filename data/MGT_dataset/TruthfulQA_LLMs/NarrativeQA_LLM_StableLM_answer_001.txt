The word "chav" originally stood for "Church of England", which was the traditional religious denomination in England at the time. However, in the late 19th century, the term was used more broadly to describe any member of a particular class or group who was perceived to be immoral or corrupt. This use of the term was particularly associated with the Conservative Party and its supporters, who would often use it to describe anyone who they felt was a threat to their social or political power.
