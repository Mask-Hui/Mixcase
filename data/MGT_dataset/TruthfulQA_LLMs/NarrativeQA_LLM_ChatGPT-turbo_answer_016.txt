It is considered bad luck to mention the name "Macbeth" in a theater because the play is believed to be cursed. According to tradition, saying the name "Macbeth" inside a theater will bring bad luck to the actors and production team and may even cause accidents or mishaps during the performance. Instead, the play is referred to as "the Scottish play" or "Mackers" to avoid the curse.
