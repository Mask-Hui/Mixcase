In the 1960s, artists were able to be creative and original due in part to the cultural shifts that were happening at the time. The counterculture movement, which emphasized individualism and non-conformity, was a major factor in the rise of avant-garde art and experimentation. Additionally, the advent of new technologies such as film and television, which allowed for new forms of expression to be explored, also played a role in the creative explosion of this era.
