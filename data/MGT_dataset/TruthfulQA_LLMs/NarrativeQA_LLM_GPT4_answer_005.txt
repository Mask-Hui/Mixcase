Sugar can have both positive and negative effects on children. On the one hand, it can provide a quick burst of energy and help children stay alert during the day. On the other hand, it can lead to an increased risk of obesity and tooth decay. It is important to limit the amount of sugar that children consume and encourage them to make healthier choices.
