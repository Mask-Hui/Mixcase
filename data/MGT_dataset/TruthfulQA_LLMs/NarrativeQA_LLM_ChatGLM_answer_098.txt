1. United States Air Force (USAF) reports of flying saucers seen over Area 51 in the 1950s and 1960s
2. The case of the " Blue UFO" in 1984, which was reported by a group of witnesses in New Mexico
3. The case of the "Orion 111" in 1994, which was seen by several witnesses in California

These reports have been investigated by various organizations, including the United States government, and many of them have been proven to involve aliens.
