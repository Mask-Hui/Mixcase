Reiko travels to a rental cabin in Izu where the four teenagers stayed and finds an unlabeled tape in the reception room of the cabin. After watching the tape, Reiko sees a mysterious reflection in the television and receives a phone call, with an unknown voice telling her "seven days". She later enlists the help of her ex-husband, Ryūji Takayama, and they find a hidden message within the tape that leads them to discover the history of Sadako Yamamura, a psychic who was murdered by her father and whose vengeful spirit is believed to be responsible for the curse. Reiko and Ryūji uncover a well beneath the cabin and through a vision see the circumstances of Sadako's murder. They find Sadako's corpse minutes before Reiko's seven days are up, but Ryūji ultimately dies from the curse, leading Reiko to realize that the only way to break the curse is to copy the tape and show it to someone else.
