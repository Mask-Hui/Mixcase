Christopher's life changed drastically after his father's death. He was only ten years old and his family's fortune was suddenly taken away, forcing him to work as a laborer on the family estate. He had to forego education and work tirelessly to support his blind mother and two sisters, while keeping his mother in ignorance of their change of fortune. His heart became hardened and he developed a deep hatred for Mr. Fletcher, the manager who cheated and gained possession of the estate. It wasn't until years later, after leading Fletcher's weak and drunken grandson to kill him, that Christopher realized the enormity of his sin and took responsibility by going to prison for five years. However, his life took a turn for the better when he was pardoned and reunited with Maria Wyndham, the woman he loved, who restored the estate to its rightful owner.
