In the context of the film, Mulder and Scully first see a strange train hauling tanker trucks in Texas. They follow it to a large cornfield surrounding two glowing domes. They enter the domes, only to find them empty, and then encounter a swarm of bees and black helicopters before escaping back to Washington.
