In the movie End Of Watch, Jack (George Clooney) is the main character. He is a gunsmith and contract killer. Mathilde, who works for a Swiss private security company, is the person who wants to kill him. She tries to kill him twice, but fails both times. In the first attempt, she shot at him with a pistol, and in the second attempt, she tried to kill him with an experimental sniper rifle. Both attempts fail. Jack is about to deliver the experimental sniper rifle to her, but before he does, he is shot by an assassin from Sweden who wants to kill him.
The question is: how Mathilde dies in the final scene. She could die of shock or because she was shot by the assassins from Sweden. However, in the final scene, she is shown to be alive, and she is seen with a white butterfly that flits up into the sky. In the question, she could either die of shock or from the bullet that kills Jack. However, in both cases, it is not shown in the movie, and it is not clear how the white butterfly got into the sky in the final scene.
