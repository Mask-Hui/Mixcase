To Kill a Mockingbird author Nelle Harper Lee invited Truman Capote to visit her on a trip to Kansas in 1959. Capote was fascinated by the Clutter family case and spent several weeks interviewing suspects Perry Smith and Richard Hickock, while making personal contact with Perry Smith. As the case progressed, Capote became emotionally attached to Perry Smith and helped to free him and his brother Alvin from prison by appealing to a sympathetic judge. He ultimately succeeded in getting Perry Smith to relive details of the killings to help him to tell his own version of what happened, which he would not have otherwise been able to discuss. Capote was ultimately frustrated as he could not prove the killers' guilt and still could not finish his book. Ultimately Capote was not responsible for bringing the Clutter case to a successful conclusion, as it was resolved through the efforts of others, including local Kansas attorney William Shawn, and Truman's long-time friend Nelle Harper Lee.
