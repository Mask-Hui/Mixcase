I am not sure about that. Assuming that John Girdlestone was the son of Girdlestone the company, and assuming that the business failed because of a series of disastrous speculations, I do not think that John Girdlestone killed his son, but that his son rejected the plan, and that his father killed him in order to gain sole ownership of the company.
