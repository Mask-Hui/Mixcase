The context describes the plot of a book, and according to it, Christopher Blake, the central character of the book, loves Maria Wyndham, the granddaughter of Mr. Fletcher, the possessor of the estate that was previously owned by Christopher's forbears. After serving a three-year sentence in prison for leading to ruin Mr. Fletcher's grandson, Christopher is pardoned through Maria's efforts, and she restores the estate to its rightful owner. The context, however, does not mention whether Christopher and Maria get married, but it suggests that they are lovers who are finally united after many years of unhappiness.
