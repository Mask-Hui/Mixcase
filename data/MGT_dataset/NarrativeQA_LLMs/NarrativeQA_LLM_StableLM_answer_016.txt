The goblins are defeated in the end, as they were driven back into their mines by the King's army. The Princess Irene and Curdie escape to their own lands, where they are introduced to their respective families. Curdie learns from his own experiences that the goblins' weakness is their soft, vulnerable feet, which he overcomes by sneaking into the Great Hall of the goblin palace and stealing one of the Queen's stone shoes. In the end, the goblins are banished from the kingdom, and the princess is married to the goblin prince Harelip.
