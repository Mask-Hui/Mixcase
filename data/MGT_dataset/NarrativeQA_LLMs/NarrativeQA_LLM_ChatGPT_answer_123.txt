Toothless breaks the Bewilderbeast's control over the other dragons by challenging it and shooting it in the face repeatedly. This breaks the Bewilderbeast's control over the other dragons, who then side with Toothless as the new Alpha dragon. All the dragons repeatedly fire at the Bewilderbeast until Toothless fires a final massive blast, breaking its left tusk.
