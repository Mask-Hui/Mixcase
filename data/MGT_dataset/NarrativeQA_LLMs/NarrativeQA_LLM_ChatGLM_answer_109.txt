When Lizzie returns home to Laura from the goblin market, she is greeted with a series of events that ultimately lead to Laura's transformation into a beautiful, vibrant, and energetic person.

Lizzie finds Laura in a state of ecstatic trance, surrounded by the goblin fruits that she had gorged on earlier. Despite her initial excitement, Lizzie is filled with worried thoughts about Laura's health and wellbeing. She reminds Laura of the cautionary tale of Jeanie, who had died from consuming the goblins' fruits, and reminds her of the violent assault that Lizzie received from the goblins.

Lizzie realizes that Laura is on the verge of death and decides to visit the goblins to buy some of their fruit in an attempt to soothe her pain. However, when the goblins realize that Lizzie plans to pay with silver to buy the fruit, they turn upon her. The goblins viciously pummel and assault Lizzie, and try to feed her their fruits by force.

Lizzie escapes and runs home, hoping that Laura will eat and drink the pulp and juice from her body. However, Laura's physical and mental health are quickly restored, and she is able to continue her daily routine. Lizzie is relieved and grateful for Laura's quick recovery, and the two sisters continue to bond over their shared experiences at the goblin market.

In the end, the poem reflects on the power of sisterly love and the importance of sharing stories and experiences with one another. The poem encourages readers to be kind and compassionate towards others, and to never give up on the ones we love.
