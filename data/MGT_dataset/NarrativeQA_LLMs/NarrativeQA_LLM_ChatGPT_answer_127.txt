Alfred incriminated himself with false evidence as part of a plan to poison Emily Inglethorp, in order to inherit her wealth and income. The plan was for Alfred to incriminate himself with false evidence that could then be refuted at his trial, and once he was acquitted due to double jeopardy, he could not be tried for the crime a second time should any genuine evidence against him be subsequently discovered.
