The majority of the story occurs in the first-person narrative of Dr. Watson, who typically tells the stories to his companions as they experience them. The first Sherlock Holmes story is "The Speckled Band," which is told by Watson as he sits in his room reading a book by the German writer Friedrich Nietzsche. The other stories are "The Red-Headed League," "A Scandal in Bohemia," "The Five Orange Pips," and "The Adventure of the Speckled Band." These stories are all told in the first person, and each reflects Watson's perspective as he experiences the events they describe.
