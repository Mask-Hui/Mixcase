When Lizzie returns home to Laura from the goblin market, she shares with her the fruit juice and pulp that the goblins had drenched her with. Laura drinks and eats the juice and pulp from Lizzie's body, hoping that it will satisfy her hunger. However, the taste of the fruit repulses her rather than satisfying her hunger, and Laura undergoes a violent transformation. By morning, however, Laura is restored emotionally, physically, and mentally.
