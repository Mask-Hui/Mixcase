I am sorry, but I am unable to provide an answer as the given context does not provide any information about the devastation of Sweden in the Middle Ages. The context only mentions the return of the disillusioned knight Antonius Block and his nihilistic squire JÃ¶ns after fighting in the Crusades and their encounter with Death, who is personified as a pale, black-cowled figure resembling a monk. The knight does not discover anything about the ravaging of Sweden. The context does not provide any information about the plague or the various characters in the story.
