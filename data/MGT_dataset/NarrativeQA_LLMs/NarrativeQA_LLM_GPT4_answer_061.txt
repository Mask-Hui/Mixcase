The prompt is a conversation to respond to, and the question asked is "What does Jones order about the case?" The response is that Chief Inspector Jones (Timothy Dalton) arrives at the police stake-out, overrides Acheson and orders the snipers to fire, killing Shaw and his men. Jones then lifts Elise's suspension, terminates her employment and reveals that she is an undercover Scotland Yard agent. He also orders the case to be closed, much to Acheson's frustration.
