The context suggests that the Jews are naturally drawn to areas where they are not persecution, and their presence in those places gives rise to persecution. The author believes that this is a inevitable consequence of the Jewish question, which persists wherever Jews live in appreciable numbers.

The author believes that a wondrous generation of Jews will spring into existence if the Jews who wish for a State have it.
