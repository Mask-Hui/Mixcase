Dain Maroola is a Malayan prince who came to see Almayer about trading. While there, he fell in love with Nina. Mrs. Almayer kept arranging meetings for Nina and Dain, but they never married. Dain left but vowed to return to help Almayer find the gold mine. When he did return, he went straight to Lakamba, a Malayan rajah, and told him that he found the gold mine and that some Dutchmen had captured his ship. The rajah tells him to kill Almayer before the Dutch arrive because he is not needed to find the gold now.
