What is the context and plot of the movie "Elizabeth: The Golden Age"? 

The movie "Elizabeth: The Golden Age" is set in 1585 and tells the story of Queen Elizabeth I of England, played by Cate Blanchett. At the time, Catholic Spain, ruled by King Philip II, is the most powerful country in the world, and seeing Protestant England as a threat, Philip declares war. Meanwhile, Elizabeth is being pressured to marry, and suitors are presented to her, including Charles II, Archduke of Austria. She refuses to marry any of them, and instead becomes attracted to English explorer Walter Raleigh, played by Clive Owen. Raleigh offers Elizabeth potatoes, tobacco, two Native Americans, and gold from a Spanish ship. Elizabeth commands that the Native Americans be treated well and refuses to accept the gold. Elizabeth seeks guidance from her astrologer, Dr. John Dee, who predicts that two empires will go to war. Jesuits in London conspire with Philip to assassinate Elizabeth and replace her with Mary, Queen of Scots, who is Catholic. Mary is executed for high treason, and Philip uses her death to obtain papal approval for war. Philip plans to invade England and make his daughter, Isabella, the Queen of England in Elizabeth's place. The Armada begins its approach up the English Channel, but at the last moment, a major storm blows the Armada toward the beaches. Elizabeth gives her Speech to the Troops at Tilbury, while seated on a war horse and wearing full plate armor.
