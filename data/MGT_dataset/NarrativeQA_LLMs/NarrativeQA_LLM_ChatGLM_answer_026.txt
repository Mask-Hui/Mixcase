The main difficulty in rescuing the Britannia is that the coordinates of the wreckage are mostly erased, and only the latitude (37 degrees) is known, making it difficult to navigate to the location. Additionally, the bottle retrieved from a shark's stomach does not provide any clues about the origin of the wreckage. The remaining clues consist of a few words in three languages, but they are re-interpreted several times throughout the novel to make various destinations seem likely, making the search for the wreckage even more challenging.
