John Girdlestone ruins the firm by making disastrous speculations and resorting to chicanery to save the firm. He sends an agent to the Ural mountains to claim to have found diamond mines, but the discovery of bona fide diamond mines in South Africa ruins their plan and they sell their diamonds cheaply, which leaves them in an even more precarious situation. Finally, he decides to murder his friend's daughter to get the inheritance, a sinister plan that leads to his son's failure and his father's plan to murder the girl.
