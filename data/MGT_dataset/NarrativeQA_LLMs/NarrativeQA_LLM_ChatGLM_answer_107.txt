Valentin Bulgakov plays a key role in the maneuvering between the "Tolstoians" and the rest of the family in the film. He is seen mediating between the two sides and also has a love affair with Masha, one of the Tolstoians. Ultimately, Tolstoy signs the new will and travels to an undisclosed location where he can continue his work undisturbed.
