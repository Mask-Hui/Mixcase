Socrates ultimately decides it is unjust to escape because he believes that to break the Laws of Athens by escaping would be to break the social contract between a citizen and the state. He argues that a citizen is bound to the Laws like a child is bound to a parent and to go against the Laws would be like striking a parent. Furthermore, breaking one law would mean breaking them all, and in doing so, Socrates would cause them great harm. For these reasons, he concludes that he must abide by the Laws of Athens, even if it means facing his execution.
