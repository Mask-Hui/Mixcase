Socrates compares citizens and the law to children and a parent. The analogy suggests that citizens are bound by the laws of their city like children are bound by their parents, and that breaking the laws would be like striking one's parent. This analogy emphasizes the importance of conforming to the laws and the social contract as a way of upholding the values and way of life of a city.
