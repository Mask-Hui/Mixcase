The L-Dopa treatment caused some of Dr. Sayer's patients to experience a limited period of "awakening," followed by the return to cataonia or a similar state. However, some of the patients also experienced full-body spasms and other adverse effects. Leonard Lowe became romantically interested in Paula, but returned to his catatonic state soon after. The other patients' fears were realized, and the nurses were shown treating the catatonic patients with more respect and care. The film ends with Sayer standing over Leonard behind a Ouija board, "Let's begin."
