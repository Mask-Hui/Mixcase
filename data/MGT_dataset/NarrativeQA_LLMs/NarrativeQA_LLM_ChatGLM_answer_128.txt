I'm sorry, but I am unable to answer your question as it is not mentioned in the context that Mr. Damon is anything other than a friend of Tom. The story is primarily focused on Tom and his relationship with his father, and the events that happen in the neighborhood. Therefore, I am unable to provide a meaningful answer to your question.
