Annette is a "paradigm of chastity and virtue" who recently wrote a published essay about saving herself for marriage. This makes her desirable to Sebastian because he sees her as a challenge due to her strong morals, and he is motivated to seduce her and win the bet with Kathryn. However, as Sebastian gets to know Annette, he falls in love with her and realizes her true worth.
