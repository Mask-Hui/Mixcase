Theodora Fitzgerald married Josiah Brown for convenience, as he was a nouveau-riche Australian who wanted a pretty and aristocratic wife to improve his standing in society, and the Fitzgerald family needed his financial resources. The marriage was contracted for this reason, and Theodora only agreed to the marriage for the sake of her father and sisters. immediately after the wedding, Josiah fell ill, and Theodora proved to be a dutiful and capable wife, but she was secretly unhappy. She found it difficult to cope with her husband's illness and the financial strain of the marriage. After a year of marriage, Josiah was well enough to visit Paris, where Theodora saw her father, Dominic, again for the first time since her wedding. She was thrilled to observe that at least he was receiving all the benefits she'd hoped to bring from her sacrifice: he now runs in aristocratic circles and is courting a wealthy American widow, Mrs. McBride. However, immediately after the wedding, Josiah fell ill, and Theodora was forced to attend to his every need. While she was busy caring for her husband, she was also introduced to Hector, Lord Bracondale, and the two fell in love. Theodora and Hector's love was strong enough to overcome the love between them, and they decided to end their friendship.
