A protagonist is an protagonist, so Newton is an alien who comes to Earth seeking to construct a spaceship for the rest of the Anthean population, but his alien nature is discovered by Nathan Bryce, leading to his arrest by the CIA, and ultimately enabling the Republicans to take power and ultimately leading to a catastrophe.
As for who is the protagonist, Betty Jo is the protagonist because she falls in love with him, even though he is an alien, and also because he talks to his friends in the form of a conversation, including revealing his plans for space travel, although only to Betty Jo, his true friends Nathan Bryce and his company remain in the shadows.
