The novel ends with Paula wounding herself mortally with a rifle. It is not explicitly stated whether it is a suicide, as her lover Graham believes, or an accident, as she tells her husband. She convinces a doctor to inject her with an overdose of morphine and as she drifts off, she bids goodbye to both of her lovers, including her husband and Evan Graham. Her final words are, "Two bonnie, bonnie men. Good-by, bonnie men. Good-by, Red Cloud.... Stretch the skin tight, first. You know I donâ€™t like to be hurt."
