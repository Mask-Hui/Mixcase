Dr. Sayer's patients all returned to their catatonic state, despite the success of L-Dopa in initially awakening them. However, Sayer notes that although the "awakening" did not last, another kind of awakening took place in which the patients learned to appreciate and live life. Sayer also begins a personal awakening, overcoming his shyness and asking Nurse Costello out for coffee. The film ends with Sayer and Leonard seated behind a Ouija board as Sayer says, "Let's begin."
