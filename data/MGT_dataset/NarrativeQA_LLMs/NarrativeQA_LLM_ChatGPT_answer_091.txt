In the end, the goblins are drowned when they flood the mines. Curdie warns the others, but it is too late to save the goblins from drowning. This happens after they break through the palace floor in an attempt to abduct Princess Irene and marry her to goblin prince Harelip. Curdie follows the magic thread to Irene's refuge and restores her to the king, and the goblins are ultimately defeated.
