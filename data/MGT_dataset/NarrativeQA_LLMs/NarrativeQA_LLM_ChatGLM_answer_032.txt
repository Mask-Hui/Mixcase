Why does Siddhartha go back to the river?

Siddhartha goes back to the river because he realizes that the luxurious lifestyle he has chosen is merely a game, empty of spiritual fulfillment. He wants to find true spiritual enlightenment and find a way to live a simple and fulfilling life. He also wants to connect with the river and listen to its voice, which helps him to understand the true meaning of life and find spiritual enlightenment.
