Gale and Evelle returned from prison looking for revenge. They were planning on robbing a "hayseed" bank with Junior in tow. Nathan Arizona Sr. noticed their car and approached them, but Nathan Sr. refused Smalls offer to get the child back for $50,000. Nathan Sr. believed that Smalls was the kidnapper. When Smalls arrived, he confronted Evelle and Gale and tried to take the baby, but they overheard Smalls talking about the plan to kidnap Junior and reported this to Nathan Sr. Nathan Sr. knew Nathan Jr. was missing and contacted the bounty hunter Leonard Smalls (Randall "Tex" Cobb). When Smalls arrived at the bank, he confronted the crooks and tried to take the baby, but one of the bank's dye canisters exploded and shot him. The couple reunited with the child and decided to not inform the police.
