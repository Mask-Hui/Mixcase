Nina and Dain were smuggled away by Mrs. Almayer, but were later discovered by Almayer. Almayer aided in their escape by taking them to the mouth of the river where a canoe would rescue them from the Dutch. They escaped, but Mrs. Almayer ran away to the rajah for protection, taking all of Dain's dowry with her.
