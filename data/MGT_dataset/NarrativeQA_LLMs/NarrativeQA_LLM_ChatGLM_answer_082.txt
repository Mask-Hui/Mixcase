Brian Clough doesn't like Leeds because of their violent and physical style of play under Revie's management. Clough and Taylor were the former managers of Derby County, and Clough was a fierce critic of Leeds because of their style of play under Revie. Clough tried to secure his position by offering his and Taylor's resignations in a protest against the chairman's unwilligness to fund further signings, but the club accepted their resignations and banned them from entering the Baseball Ground again. After Clough and Taylor were offered jobs at Brighton & Hove Albion, they agreed to take the jobs after taking an all-expenses-paid holiday in Majorca. However, Taylor argued the case for staying at Brighton, and Clough eventually went their separate ways.
