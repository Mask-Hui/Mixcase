In 1895, Decepticon arch-enemy Megatron crashed in the Arctic Circle after an unsuccessful mission to find the AllSpark, a Transformer artifact that would bring life to Cybertron. Unable to bring the AllSpark back to life, Megatron froze, and a great-great-grandson, named Sam Witwicky, discovered the frozen Decepticon when he went searching for snowmobile ice-kissing sites. Megatron was in possession of a navigational device, which scanned the AllSpark's coordinates into the glasses owner's possession. The glasses, which eventually led to the involvement of the descendant of a WWII marine, the Camaro, the new car of the film.
