Vervelle is initially disappointed when he finds out that a number of the paintings he bought were Grassou's forgeries, but he soon realizes that Grassou's reputation as an artist has increased in value as a result. Vervelle believes that Grassou possesses the combined talent of several famous artists, Rubens, Rembrandt, Terburg, and Titian, and therefore, his value as a son-in-law has increased as well. Vervelle remains enchanted with Grassou and still believes he would make a good match for his daughter Virginie.
