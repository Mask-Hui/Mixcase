Anvoy does not keep the money because of a promise made by her now-deceased aunt Lady Coxon, who had been seeking to bestow a sum of 13,000 pounds upon a talented intellectual whose potential has been hampered by lack of money. Lady Coxon had failed to find such a person, and upon her death, the money was to be left to Anvoy with the moral obligation to carry on the quest of finding someone worthy of the money. Anvoy feels compelled to honor her aunt's wish and to find a deserving intellectual to receive the funds.
