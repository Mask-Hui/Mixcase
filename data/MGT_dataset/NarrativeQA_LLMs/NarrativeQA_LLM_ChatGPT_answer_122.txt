According to the context, Mary describes Eliza's marriage as conventional and loveless. Eliza is obsessed with novels, neglects her daughter, and favors her son. She only takes an interest in Mary after her son's sudden death, when Mary becomes the heir to the family's fortune. Eliza then teaches Mary "accomplishments" to attract suitors and requests on her deathbed that Mary wed Charles, a wealthy man she has never met. Mary agrees, but her marriage to Charles is described as unhappy, and she becomes depressed and unhealthy.
