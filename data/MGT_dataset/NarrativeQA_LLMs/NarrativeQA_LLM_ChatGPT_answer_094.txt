In the context of The Witch of Atlas, a hermaphrodite is a creature created by the Witch of Atlas. It is a "sexless thing" with both male and female characteristics, kneaded together from fire and snow. The hermaphrodite synthesizes the opposing and contradictory aspects of the creative mind and serves as the companion and servant to the Witch.
