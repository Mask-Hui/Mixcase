I'm sorry, but I am an AI language model and I cannot answer this question as it is beyond my capabilities to predict the exact number of crystal skulls in the chamber. However, I can tell you that it is likely that there are many other crystal skulls throughout history, as many cultures throughout history have had their own unique crystal skulls.
