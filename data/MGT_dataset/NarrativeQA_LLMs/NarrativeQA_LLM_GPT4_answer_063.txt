Sophia went to Russia with Alexei because she was pregnant and wanted to start a new life with him. She had grown tired of the scam and wanted to start a new chapter in her life. John, on the other hand, was not interested in starting a new life with Sophia and was more concerned about clearing his name as a wanted bank robber. He ultimately decided against taking Sophia to the police and left her at the airport, where she was kidnapped by Alexei.
