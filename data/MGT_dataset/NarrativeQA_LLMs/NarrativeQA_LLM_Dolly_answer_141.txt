Actaeon is likely a reference to Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, who was executed by Queen Elizabeth I of England.  As an aristocrat who was caught sight of in the woods while hunting, he was mistaken for a leopard and brought a crime against nature and, by extension, the state.  He is both physically (Essex was gruesomely mutilated at the hands of the king's executioner) and symbolically (he was burned at the stake and became a warning to others against sin) associated with the subject of the masque.
