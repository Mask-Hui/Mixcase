In the context of the dialogue, Socrates compares the citizens of Athens to the laws of Athens. The citizens are seen as living in a kind of social contract with the Laws, and are bound to them by this contract. However, the citizens are also aware of the consequences of breaking these laws, such as being punished in the underworld. This analogy between the citizens and the laws highlights the importance of living a virtuous life and following the laws that are laid out for us.
