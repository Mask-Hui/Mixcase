Valka is revealed to be Hiccup's long-lost mother. She spent twenty years rescuing dragons from Drago's traps and brought them to an island nest created out of ice by a gigantic Alpha dragon called a "Bewilderbeast", where she and her son Hiccup found safety. Despite her love for her son, Valka could not bring herself to kill dragons, and she left Berk to live on an island with her dragon, Toothless. When Hiccup returned to Berk after the battle, he was inspired by Valka's words and his father's to unite humans and dragons and to stop Drago from conquering the village.
