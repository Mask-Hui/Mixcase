Based on the provided context, I can answer the question with "the mark".  Lily is the mark of Jake's.  Based on the question, Lily is a grifter who tried to pull off the same con that Jake was a part of, but was caught and ended up getting killed.  The question specifies that Lily was the "latest mark" who Jake ripped off, which means Lily was the latest mark that Jake's group of grifters tried to pull off the con.
