The dead body in the motel room was that of Roy's mother, Lilly. Myra Langtry had planned to kill Lilly and leave her body in the motel room for Myra to use as evidence against her. When Myra followed her and was shot in self-defense, Lilly arranged the scene to make it look like Myra's body was her own.
