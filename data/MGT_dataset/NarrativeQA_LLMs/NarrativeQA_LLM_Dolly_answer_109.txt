The question of why Agramante attacked Europe is one of the main themes of Orlando Furioso. The Saracens, of course, are convinced that Charlemagne is the antichrist, and is after their jewels and treasures. When Orlando first meets Angelica, he is immediately attracted to her and is tempted to abandon his loyalty to Charlemagne. He accepts her offer to take a love-draught from the priests of Agrigento, a pagan god, which will make him temporarily forget his duty to God, and is thus distracted from the war against Agramante. When Orlando returns to Angelica, she has escaped from the hands of the Bavarian Duke Namo and run away with the Saracen Rodomonte, whom she has fallen in love with. Rodomonte has taken a Saracen Christian knight as a captive, and Orlando, who does not want to harm the Saracens, agrees to help them.
