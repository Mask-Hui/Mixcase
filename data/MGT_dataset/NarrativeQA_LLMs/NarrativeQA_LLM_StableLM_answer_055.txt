Tito Melema is a young Italianate-Greek scholar who meets a shipwrecked stranger, Tito, who falls in love with a woman named Romola. Tito becomes a valued member of Florentine society assisting Bardo with classical studies, and falling in love with Romola, but Tito dismisses the warning and advises Romola to trust him. Tito and Romola become betrothed at the end of Carnival, to be married at Easter after Tito returns from a visit to Rome. The novel then skips ahead to November 1494, more than eighteen months after the marriage.
