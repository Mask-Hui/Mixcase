When Mary was younger, her mother filled her free time by neglecting her and educating herself using only books and the natural world. Mary was also ignored by her family, so she devotes much of her time to charity. After her brother's death, her mother finally takes an interest in her and is taught "accomplishments" such as dancing to attract suitors. However, when Mary's mother sickens and requests that she wed a wealthy man, Mary is forced to adapt and agree to the wedding immediately. Despite her new relationship, Mary is still unable to find happiness and is left unresolved by the end of the novel.
