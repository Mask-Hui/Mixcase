It is not explicitly stated in the context why Ahmed would send Diana away if he learned of her love for him. However, it is clear that he is punishing her because she is English, as he claims to find love dull. Additionally, it is also possible that he is treating her physically虐待 because he can't bear to mistreat her any more. It is also worth noting that Ahmed's character is portrayed as being cruel and violent, and it is not surprising that he would continue to treat Diana poorly if she continued to love him.
