Socrates' decision to leave prison and attempt an escape is not based solely on the fact that it would be unjust to escape, but also on his belief in the necessity of living in accordance with the laws and the social contract established by the Athenian government. He recognizes the importance of living a virtuous and just life, and is willing to compromise his principles to achieve this goal. Additionally, his long and successful life in prison suggests that he has become accustomed to his circumstances and does not want to break free and potentially face the consequences of his actions.
