Bulgakov is the new secretary of Leo Tolstoy in the movie "The Last Station". He finds himself mediating between Tolstoy's disciples, who are trying to convince Tolstoy to sign a new will that places all his copyrights into the public domain, and Tolstoy's wife Sofya, who is opposed to this idea. Bulgakov also has a love affair with one of the Tolstoians, Masha. Throughout the film, Bulgakov tries to remain impartial and understand both sides of the argument, but ultimately he sympathizes more with Tolstoy's ideals and beliefs.
