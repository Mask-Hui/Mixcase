The prompt provided is a question to answer, task or conversation. The context is about a man named Frank Saltram who has an intellect that is only expressed through sparkling table-talk, and he is unreliable in his actions. He has a gift for conversation, but he is not grateful and does not have any obligations or duties. He is also prone to immoral acts and lives off others. The unnamed narrator is given a sealed letter that contains the denunciation of Saltram's most immoral acts. The question is what does Saltram do with the money given to him?
