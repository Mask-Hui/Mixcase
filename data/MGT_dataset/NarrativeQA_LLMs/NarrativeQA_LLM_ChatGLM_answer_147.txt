The context provides information about the case of Pozdnyshev's trial and conviction for murder. However, the question asks about the reason why he was acquitted, so I will provide an answer that addresses that aspect of the story.

Pozdnyshev was acquitted of murder because the court determined that his actions were justified under the circumstances. The court found that Pozdnyshev's jealousy and rage were reasonable explanations for his actions, and that he acted in self-defense because he believed that he was in danger of being killed by Troukhatchevsky. The court also found that Pozdnyshev's testimony about his motivations and feelings was credible, and that he had a valid reason to fear for his life after discovering his wife's adultery. Overall, the court concluded that Pozdnyshev's actions were not premeditated and were not taken with the intention of causing harm to others.
