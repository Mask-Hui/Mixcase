Almayer's house was burned to the ground by Almayer himself along with all of his furniture. He did so after Nina ran away with Dain and his wife ran away with Dain's dowry, leaving him all alone. Almayer spent the rest of his days in "[His] Folly", smoking opium to forget his daughter, and eventually died there.
