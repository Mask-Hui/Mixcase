Dr. Gordon Ashe wanted Travis Fox to travel to the past to look for a spaceship because he believed the ship was lost or destroyed 10,000 years ago. Ashe wanted to learn more about the history of the spaceship and if there was any information or artifacts that could be found that would help to further understand the ancient culture that may have used it. Additionally, Ashe wanted to use Fox as part of his team to help with the search for the spaceship, as Fox had experience with archaeology and could help to guide the team in their search.
