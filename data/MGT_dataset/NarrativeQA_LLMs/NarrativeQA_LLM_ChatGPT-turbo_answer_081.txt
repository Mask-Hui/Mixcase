Lord Goring obtains and burns Sir Robert's incriminating letter, but Mrs. Cheveley steals Lady Chiltern's note, which she plans to use to destroy Lady Chiltern's marriage. However, in the final act, Lord Goring informs Lady Chiltern of the theft, and Sir Robert reads the letter, assuming it is meant for him and interpreting it as a letter of forgiveness. The letter is not destroyed, but its contents are ultimately instrumental in the happy resolution of the play's many plot complications.
