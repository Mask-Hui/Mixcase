The question can be summarized as 'What makes a woman so attractive a prize for a man?'  Here are the elements that I think make a woman attractive:
- She is smart.  She knows how to use her sexuality in a way that entices a man
- She is independent.  She is not afraid to take control of her own sexuality or be independent
- She is beautiful.  She is a beautiful woman and she knows how to use her looks to her advantage.  She is conscious of her physical appearance, whether in a new dress or hairstyle, and knows how to apply make up.
- She is a good woman.  She is not just a sexual object but she is someone who fits the criteria listed above.
