The context provided does not mention the exact location where the slime attacks Dana and Oscar. However, the story does describe the various events leading up to the attack, including the illegal excavation of First Avenue by the Ghostbusters, the blackout, and the subsequent attack on Dana and Oscar. The Ghostbusters' investigation eventually leads them to the Statue of Liberty and the museum where Dana works, where they find and capture the ghosts. The slime also causes a citywide blackout, and the Ghostbusters are later arrested by the NYPD.
