The main difficulty in rescuing the Britannia is that the coordinates of the wreckage are mostly erased, and only the latitude (37 degrees) is known. This means that the expedition would have to circumnavigate the 37th parallel south, which is a challenging task. The bottle was retrieved from a shark's stomach, which means that it is impossible to trace its origin by the currents. This raises the question of how the characters in the novel were able to find the wreckage and how they were able to make the journey to the South Atlantic.
