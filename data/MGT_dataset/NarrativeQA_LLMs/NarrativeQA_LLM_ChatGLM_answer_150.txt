Kate and John are having marital problems after their third child is stillborn, and they are also recovering from alcoholism. The loss is particularly hard on Kate, who is also recovering from alcoholism, and the couple decides to adopt a 9-year-old Russian girl named Esther from a local orphanage. While Kate and John's deaf daughter Max embraces Esther immediately, their son Daniel is less welcoming. Kate suspects that there might be problems in Esther's background when Esther's knowledge of sex extends beyond her age, and her suspicions deepen when Esther injures another girl who had bullied her at school. Kate is further alarmed when Esther injures another girl and kills Sister Abigail with a hammer. Kate realizes what happened and attacks Esther but is restrained and sedated. The couple decides to adopt a 10-year-old girl named Leena Klammer from a mental hospital, and Leena poses as a little girl and has people adopt her, with the goal of seducing the father and having a sexual relationship with him.
