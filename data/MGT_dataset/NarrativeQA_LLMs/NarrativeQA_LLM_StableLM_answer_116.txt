Based on the context provided, I can infer that the housekeeper discovered that Mortimer Trefinnis' sister had died and his brothers were laughing and singing. However, there is no mention of the housekeeper discovering that Mr. Trefinnis and his brothers had gone insane. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what the housekeeper did when she discovered the state of the family.
