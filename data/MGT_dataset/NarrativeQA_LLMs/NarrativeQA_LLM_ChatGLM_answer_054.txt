Christopher's life changed after his father's death by finding himself obligated to work as a laborer on the estate and being forced to forego education in order to support his mother and sisters. His nature became hardened and he developed a desire for revenge against Mr. Fletcher, the past manager of the estate who was now its possessor. He ultimately led to the ruin of Fletcher's grandson, Will, and was arrested and sentenced to prison for his crimes. However, through the efforts of Maria Wyndham, who returned his affections, he was pardoned and the estate was restored to its rightful owner.
