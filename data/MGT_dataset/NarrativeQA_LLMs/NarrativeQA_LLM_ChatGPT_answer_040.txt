The research team captures Jason and another person, Rowan, and brings them to their spaceship, the Apache. They reanimate Rowan while Jason is pronounced dead and left in the morgue. However, Jason comes back to life and starts killing people on the ship. The survivors eventually escape the ship and set explosive charges to separate the remaining pontoon from the main drive section, but Jason is brought back to life and becomes an even more powerful cyborg called Uber Jason. In the end, Brodski intercepts Jason in mid-flight and maneuvers them both into the atmosphere of Earth Two, incinerating them.
