Nina and Dain were smuggled away from the Dutch by Mrs. Almayer, but their hiding place was revealed to the Dutch by a slave girl. Almayer then offered to help them escape by taking them to the mouth of the river, where a canoe would rescue them from the Dutch. They managed to escape, and Almayer erased their footprints before returning home. However, Mrs. Almayer ran away to the Malayan rajah for protection, taking all of Dain's dowry with her. Almayer was left alone, and he burned down his house and spent the rest of his days smoking opium in his folly.
