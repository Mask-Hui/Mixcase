There is no logical answer to this question, because there is no clear line of connection between the events in the present and the pre-historic past of Cybertron. However, I can tell you that Bumblebee was involved in the original events that led to the battle between the Autobots and Decepticons on Cybertron. He was used as a human shield by Megatron and, as a result, ended up in the Arctic Circle, where he discovered an extinct Autobot that had been frozen in the past. Bumblebee was also instrumental in helping to retrieve the AllSpark from Megatronâ€™s body.
