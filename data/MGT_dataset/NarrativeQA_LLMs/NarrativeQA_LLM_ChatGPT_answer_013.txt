The dead body in the motel room was not Lilly's, but rather Myra Langtry's. Lilly had shot Myra in self-defense and then arranged the scene to make it look like Myra's body was actually Lilly's. Roy discovers this when he is called by an FBI agent to identify his mother's body, which is later revealed to be a ploy by Lilly to steal all of Roy's money.
