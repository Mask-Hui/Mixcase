The case described is that of William Falder, who was forced to forge a check to help his beloved Ruth escape the cruelty of her then-husband. He was charged with forgery and was sent to prison, where he met his death.
In prison, William was destitute of human compassion and, through the seemingly inhuman system of justice, found himself trapped. Justice crushed him, leaving him with no one to turn to but gentle Jesus.
