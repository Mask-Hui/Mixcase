The prompt is a conversation to respond to, and the question asked is "Why did Clough and Taylor argue in Majorca?" The response is: "During their holiday that summer, Clough agreed to take control of Leeds after being approached by their representatives. Taylor, however, argued the case for staying at Brighton and after a bitter quarrel, the two went their separate ways."
