What is Fletcher most concerned about?

Fletcher is most concerned about his ability to keep his promises and lie to his son Max. He is struggling with his compulsive lying and the consequences it has had on his relationships with his son, his ex- wife Audrey, and his former wife Greta. He is also struggling with the consequences of his actions in the case against Samantha Cole, where he accidentally told a lie that led to the breakdown of his relationship with Audrey and the loss of his loyal assistant Greta. Additionally, he is concerned that winning the case against Samantha Cole has punished the loving husband and rewarded the cheating wife, leading to a crisis of conscience and the loss of his trust in the legal system.
