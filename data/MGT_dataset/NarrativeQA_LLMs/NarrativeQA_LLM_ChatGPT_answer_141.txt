Vasudeva urges Siddhartha to let his son find his own path, much like Siddhartha did himself in his youth. Although Siddhartha is desperate to find his runaway son, Vasudeva advises him to have faith in his son's journey and trust that he will find his own way in life. Vasudeva believes that every person must follow their own unique path, just as Siddhartha did, and that attempting to control or manipulate another person's journey is ultimately futile.
