Jake survived being shot because he was wearing squibs, which were fake blood diamonds. When Travis (the henchman for Morgan Price) shot Jake, he didn't realize that Jake was wearing squibs. The squibs filled the pool of blood and made it appear as if Jake had been shot. However, when Butan arrived and saw the pool of blood, he didn't realize that it was fake. Therefore, Jake was able to survive the shooting and sit up without being hurt.
