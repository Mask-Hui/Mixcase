Socrates reject the study of language because he believes it to be philosophically inferior to a study of things themselves. He believes that language is a human invention that serves to express the essence of things, but that it can be used to signify things that are not actually present or exist. He argues that the study of language is better suited to explore the nature of reality and the objects around us, rather than trying to understand their names or the words we use to describe them.
