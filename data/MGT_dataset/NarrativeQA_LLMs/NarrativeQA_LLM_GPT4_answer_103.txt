The main conflict of the story is a love triangle between Paula, Dick Forrest (the protagonist), and Evan Graham. Paula is unable to bear children, and like Charmian in the novel "The Acorn Planters," she is subject to insomnia. Paula and Evan are both in love with Dick, but Paula is also attracted to Evan. The love triangle creates tension and conflict throughout the novel.
