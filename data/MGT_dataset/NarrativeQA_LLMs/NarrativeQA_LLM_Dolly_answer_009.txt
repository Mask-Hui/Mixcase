Based on the passage, it is clear that Theodora and Hector went on a date on the day they had their romantic encounter. They had this date in the car, which is a common place to take a date. The date lasted one hour and twenty minutes, which is significantly longer than the average amount of time that it takes for a car to travel at 60 miles per hour. This length of time is also longer than the average amount of time for a couple to date. The date happened in a remote area of Paris, which implies that they were driving a vehicle that was in a remote area. They also did not stop for food, drink or bathroom breaks throughout their date, which implies that they were traveling at a high rate of speed. Given these facts, the best explanation for where they went on the date is that they went to a remote location to do ajet-ski ride.
