Who does Claude Lantier marry?
The answer is Christine Hallegrain.
Because Claude Lantier is a painter who is obsessed with creating masterpieces and is depressed, and because Christine Hallegrain is a supportive friend who encourages him to create masterpieces by providing a helpful context, and because Sandoz and Bongrand are other painters who provide encouragement, Claude Lantier ultimately marries Christine Hallegrain.
