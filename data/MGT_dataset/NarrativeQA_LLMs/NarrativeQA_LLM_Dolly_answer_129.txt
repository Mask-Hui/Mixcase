That is a very interesting question. I believe the best answer comes from the Laws of Athens. In the very beginning of the dialogue, Socrates questions Crito about his own reasons for trying to convince him to leave. Crito gives two reasons, that he should not have to suffer through the guilt of an attempted escape himself, and that he should not abandon his sons. 
Now, the Laws speak to Socrates in the form of a series of questions. First, they ask if it is just for Socrates to attempt an escape. The Laws reply that to try to escape is to strike one's parent, to the father of the laws. Secondly, they ask if it would be just for Socrates to attempt an escape. The Laws reply that the Laws themselves compel him to stay. 
So what does Socrates do? He accepts the Laws' counsel and tries to persuade them to change their mind.
