Capote's intentions while in Kansas are to document the Clutter family tragedy and interview those involved with the Clutter family, with childhood friend Nelle Harper Lee as his go-between and facilitator. He also wants to gain access to the murderers, Perry Smith and Richard "Dick" Hickock, by using flattery, bribery, and a keen insight into the human condition. Ultimately, he intends to expand the story into a full-length book.
