Anvoy does not keep the money because she feels a moral obligation to give it away to Lady Coxon's husband's friend, Gravener, as he is a kind and intelligent man who is also engaged to her. However, Gravener is a fraud and not a gentleman, which makes Anvoy's decision to give the money to Saltram even more understandable. By giving the money to Saltram, Anvoy is ensuring that he will live off it as he has lived off others in the past, ultimately leading to the loss of the pleasure of Saltram's conversation for everyone involved.
