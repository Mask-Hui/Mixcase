Based on the provided context, the question is: Where does Dwyer open his in vitro clinic?
Given the proximity between Barney Livingston and Laura Castellano, who are siblings who are as close as siblings, it would be reasonable to assume that Dwyer would open his in vitro clinic in California given his relationship there. However, Dwyer does not open his in vitro clinic in California, he opens his in vitro clinic in Hawaii.
