Paul Edgecomb was the prison officer in charge of death row and the state's electric chair at Cold Mountain Penitentiary in 1935. John Coffey was the first to be executed that year. While there is no evidence that John's supernatural powers cured Paul of his bladder infection, there is evidence that John's death acted as a "surprise visit" from his late mother, providing a much-needed emotional uplift to Paul who was otherwise struggling with grief over the loss of his wife and son in the Great Depression.
