The court wonders if Fletcher is crazy due to his erratic behavior in court. He objects to himself and badgers and provokes his own witnesses into admitting they had an affair against Samantha and her husband's prenuptial agreement. He even goes so far as to beat himself up and claim that someone attacked him in order to try and avoid the case. He has a crisis of conscience and shouts at the Judge demanding that he reverse the decision, but he is arrested for contempt of court.
