Capote's intention in Kansas is to document the tragedy of the Clutter family murder case for The New Yorker magazine. He travels to Kansas with his childhood friend Nelle Harper Lee to interview those involved with the Clutter family, with Lee as his go-between and facilitator. Capote forms an attachment to one of the murder suspects, Perry Smith, and starts to form the story into a full-length book. He spends several years visiting Smith and learning about his life, and eventually gets Smith to describe the killings and his thoughts at the time in great detail. Capote's goal is to write a book about the case, which eventually becomes "In Cold Blood".
