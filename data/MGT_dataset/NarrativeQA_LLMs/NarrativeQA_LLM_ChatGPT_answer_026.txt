Brian Clough dislikes Leeds because of the violent and physical style of play under the management of Don Revie, who was the former manager of Leeds. This conflict roots from a 1968 FA Cup match between Leeds and Derby, where Clough made preparations for the match but Revie failed to acknowledge him. Clough initially blamed the brutality of the Leeds players, but eventually realized that his team was not good enough on a technical level. Clough also had a public disagreement with Sam Longson, the chairman of Derby, after losing a European Cup semi-final match against Juventus.
