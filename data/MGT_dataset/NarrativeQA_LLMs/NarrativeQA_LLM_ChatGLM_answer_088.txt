The context indicates that Pierre Grassou de Foug√®res is a mediocre painter who lives off painting forgeries commissioned by an old swindler and art-dealer named Elias Magus. Magus resells these forgeries for a large profit to members of the Petite bourgeoisie who are incapable of appreciating good art.

The paragraph further mentions that Monsieur Vervelle, a prosperous bottle-dealer obsessed with art, is introduced to Grassou by Magus, who introduces the painter as a grand master. Vervelle and his wife are enchanted with Grassou and believe he would make a good match for their daughter Virginie. Grassou is invited toVille-d'Avray, where the Vervelle mansion is garishly decorated, and also includes a large collection of Grassou's work, including the forgery of a Titian.

The question is: Who buys what Grassou creates?
