Ayrton is a quarter-master of the Britannia. Lord and Lady Glenarvan, the Grant children, Paganel and some sailors were left in Australia after a failed attempt to seize control of the ship to practice piracy. Ayrton, a former quarter-master, was mistakenly left behind in Australia. In the book, after learning the lost coordinates of the Britannia, the Grant children, Lord and Lady Glenarvan, Paganel, a former geographer and some sailors set off for South America to find the captain. Ayrton tries to take over the Duncan to get back in the Britannia, but by sheer luck, this fails. The Grant children, Lord and Lady Glenarvan, Paganel, and some sailors board a ship to abandon Ayrton on a desert island. At the end, Ayrton reappears in the book L'Île mystérieuse (The Mysterious Island, 1874)
