Based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the specific reason why John Girdlestone wants to kill his friend's daughter. The context only provides information about John's actions and plans to make money from the business, but does not provide any information about his personal motivations or beliefs. It is important to note that basing a character's motivations on their actions or beliefs is often a dangerous and unethical approach. It is more appropriate to analyze the situation based on the information provided and to come to a conclusion based on the context and the characters' actions.
