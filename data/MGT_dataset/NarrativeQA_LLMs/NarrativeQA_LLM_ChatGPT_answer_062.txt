Hermaphroditus, created by the Witch of Atlas, is described as a "sexless thing" with both male and female characteristics and wings or pinions. Hermaphroditus is an androgynous creature that synthesizes the opposing and contradictory aspects of the creative mind. In Greek mythology, Hermaphrodite was the offspring of Hermes and Aphrodite.
