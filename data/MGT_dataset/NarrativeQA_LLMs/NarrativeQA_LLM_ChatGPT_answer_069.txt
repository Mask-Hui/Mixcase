What is the plot of the movie "Jason X"? 

"Jason X" is a science fiction slasher movie that takes place in the future, over 400 years after the events of previous "Friday the 13th" films. Jason Voorhees is captured and cryogenically frozen by the government, and is eventually discovered by a group of students who bring him aboard their spacecraft. After being accidentally thawed out, Jason goes on a killing spree aboard the ship and eventually becomes a cyborg after being rebuilt by a damaged medical station. The remaining survivors set explosives to separate the remaining pontoon from the main drive section and escape, while Brodski intercepts Jason in mid-flight and they both burn up in the atmosphere of Earth Two.
