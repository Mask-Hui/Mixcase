The question you provided is interesting. I will try to answer it based on the context provided. The question is about a group of people living in the 1960s. There is Barney Livingston and Laura Castellano. They both attend Harvard Medical School and then Columbia University. Livingston wants to become a psychiatrist and Castellano chose pediatrics. After graduation, Castellano becomes a parent with her husband and then they move to New York City. 
There are other people in the family, such as Bennett Landsmann, who went to Yale New Haven Hospital, and became a psychiatrist, but wanted to become more than just a psychiatrist. Hank Dwyer is an adoptee who went to Jesuit school and then Harvard. Others include a former Miss Oregon Grete Anderson.
One of the people living in Chicago is Seth Lazarus, who perform mercy killings. I assume that they moved to Chicago when performing mercy killings there.
