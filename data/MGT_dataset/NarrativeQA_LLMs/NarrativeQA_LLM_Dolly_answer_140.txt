The question you present is about Truman Capote, who was an American author known for his essay "In Cold Blood", based on the true story of the Clutter family. The question is about why Capote became attached to Perry Smith. Based on the context, I will give an answer. Capote was impressed by the way Perry Smith described the crime in detail after drinking to hide his guilt. While reading the New York Times, Capote was captivated by the details about the crime, which made him eager to speak with Perry Smith in order to understand the crime in greater depth. In the process of spending more time with Perry Smith and learning more details about his personal life and how the crime came to be, Capote developed feelings for him.
