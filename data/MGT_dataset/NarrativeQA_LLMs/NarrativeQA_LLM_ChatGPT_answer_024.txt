Diana is described as a young woman with a freedom in her upbringing that was normally only allowed to boys. She is independent, rejecting a proposal of marriage because she doesn't know what love is and doesn't want to know. She is kidnapped by the Sheik Ahmed Ben Hassan, who rapes her and spends several months holding her captive and brooding on her hatred for him. As she spends more time with Ahmed, she eventually realizes she is in love with him, but keeps this to herself. Over time, she submits to Ahmed's violent treatment of her, regains his trust, and eventually their mutual love is declared.
