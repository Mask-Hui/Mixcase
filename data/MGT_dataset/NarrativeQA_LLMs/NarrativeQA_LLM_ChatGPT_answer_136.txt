The person who had the diary was Tatiana, the 14-year-old girl who dies in childbirth. Anna Khitrova, the midwife who finds the diary, discovers that Tatiana was abused, addicted to heroin, forced into prostitution, and raped by Semyon and his son Kirill. It is not explicitly mentioned in the context how Tatiana died, but it is implied that her death was a result of complications during childbirth.
