Sebastian uses photographs to confront Greg with his suspicions about who warned Annette of his reputation as a womanizer. He also uses the photographs to blackmail Greg into doing his bidding, which includes investigating who warned Annette and presenting Sebastian in a good light to her. This happens after Sebastian's first attempt to seduce Annette fails, and he seeks advice from his friend Blaine Tuttle, who suggests that the informant might be Greg, Annette's ex-boyfriend and closeted jock. Later, Greg discovers that the culprit is actually Mrs. Caldwell, Cecile's mother, and Sebastian agrees to seduce Cecile as revenge on the Caldwells.
