The main difficulty in rescuing the Britannia is that the coordinates of the wreckage are mostly erased and only the latitude (37 degrees) is known. The bottle with clues was retrieved from a shark's stomach, making it impossible to trace its origin by the currents. The search party would have to circumnavigate the 37th parallel south in order to find the wreckage site.
