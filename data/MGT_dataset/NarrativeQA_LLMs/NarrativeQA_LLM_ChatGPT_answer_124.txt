Jenny stays with the alien, who is known as the Starman, after she witnesses him use one of his silver spheres to miraculously resurrect a dead deer. This event deeply moves her and changes her initial hostile and fearful attitude towards him. She becomes sympathetic to his situation and decides to help him reach his rendezvous point in Arizona, despite being pursued by the authorities. Additionally, as the two of them spend more time together, the Starman learns to communicate with Jenny and assures her that he means no harm. These factors, coupled with her growing attachment to the Starman, ultimately cause her to stay with him and continue their journey towards the Barringer Crater.
