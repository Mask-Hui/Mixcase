Taylor was set to return to the club after an all-expenses paid holiday in Majorca, but Clough made him return as a supporter. Taylor had a bitter quarrel with Clough after he refused to stay, so Clough made him take a job at Brighton & Hove Albion, another club he used to manage, instead. Brian Clough sent his then players an e-mail to tell them that he had offered his position to Taylor, but Taylor turned down the offer so Clough still have hope to return to his old club.
