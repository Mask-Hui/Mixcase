If the decision to leave Socrates' cell was unjust, Socrates would likely choose to remain in prison and try to persuade the Laws of Athens to let him go. He believes that as a citizen, he has a duty to uphold the laws of his city, and going against them would be unjust. Additionally, he believes that breaking the Laws of Athens would make him an outlaw who would not be welcome in any other civilized state for the rest of his life. Therefore, he would choose to remain in prison and try to persuade the Laws to let him go in an effort to uphold his duty to his city and its laws.
