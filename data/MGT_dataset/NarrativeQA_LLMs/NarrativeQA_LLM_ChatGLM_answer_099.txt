The best possible way that Socrates thought words came about is that names should all (or most) of which are like the things they name, and that they should express the essence of their subject. He compares the original creation of a word to the work of an artist, and believes that the creator of words uses letters containing certain sounds to express the essence of a word's subject. He also believes that the best way to speak consists in using names that are appropriate to the things they name.
