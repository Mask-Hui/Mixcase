Tom is suspicious of Mr. Peters because he is a con-artist who tries to buy out his inventions, and he is using the threat of violence to try to force Tom to give him permissions to his patents. Additionally, Mr. Peters' behavior in the recent accident, refusing to acknowledge the accident and trying to blame Tom, further reinforces Tom's suspicious nature towards him.
