Lizzie went down to the brook to visit the goblins to buy some of their fruit. Once she arrived at the stream, the goblins welcomed her and invited her to sit and dine with them. When they realized that Lizzie meant to pay with mere silver to buy the goblin-fruits to help another person, they turned upon the girl and pummeled and assaulted her. Lizzie escaped and ran home hoping that Laura would eat and drink the pulp and juice from her sister's body. Laura underwent a violent transformation, however, and ate nothing of the goblin fruit. Laura was restored. Both Laura and Lizzie live to tell their children of the evils of the goblin fruits.
