I will answer the question based on the given context.Peggy Gray, Monty's would-be wife who has been sympathetic to his lifestyle despite knowing nothing about the challenge, accepts him as a husband despite his lack of wealth. She marries him shortly after the wedding, which takes place on a night before Monty's deadline. Peggy Gray accepts him despite the lack of wealth, and they live together in a luxurious lifestyle.
