Falder throws himself down the stairs because he is completely overcome by the inexorability of his fate. He has just learned the awful news that the woman he loves has been driven by the "chariot wheel of Justice" to sell herself, and at that moment the police appear to drag him back to prison for failing to report to the authorities as a ticket-of-leave man. This realization, combined with the hopelessness and helplessness of his situation, leads Falder to take his own life.
