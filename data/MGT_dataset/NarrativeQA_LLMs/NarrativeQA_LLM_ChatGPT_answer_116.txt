When saving Balthus from Zogar Sag, Conan sets the Pictish village on fire and the two flee into the woods to escape the pursuing animals controlled by the Pictish wizard. Conan also tells Balthus about the forgotten cult of Jhebbal Sag and how Zogar Sag can control certain animals who still remember it. Using a symbol he once noticed, Conan is able to neutralize the animals and they continue on their journey to warn the settlers.
