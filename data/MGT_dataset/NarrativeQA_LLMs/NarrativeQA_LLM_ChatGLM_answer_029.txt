The question is: Why does E.T. levitate the balls as a response to Elliot and Gertie's question?

The reason E.T. levitates the balls as a response to Elliot and Gertie's question is to show the origin of its solar system. The alien explains that it levitates the balls to represent its solar system because it is a way of communicating its location and history. It also wants to show that it is a proud and powerful entity and that it is capable of doing great things.
