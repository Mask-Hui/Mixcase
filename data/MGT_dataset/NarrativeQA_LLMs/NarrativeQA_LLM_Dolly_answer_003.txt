This is not the end of the story, but an important part of the story. Her original birth mother, Lord Blythe, did not want to have anything to do with her. She lied to cover her tracks and told the lie that her name was 'Innocent' because she was afraid that if she were to admit that she had an illegitimate daughter that Jocelyn's family would disown her. In reality, she was Lady Blythe, the wife of a wealthy and well-known nobleman who, to cover her infidelity with Pierce Armitage, also told lies to cover her tracks. She had an affair with Armitage and bore him an illegitimate daughter called Innocent. The lie was that she was named after her grandmother 'Innocent'.
