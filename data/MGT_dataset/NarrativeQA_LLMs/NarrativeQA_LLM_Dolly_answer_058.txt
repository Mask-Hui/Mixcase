I was tempted to write a sequel, but now that I think about it, I don't think there will be a sequel to this story. Maybe another perspective on the story could have been added, to better illustrate one of the most intriguing aspects of the story - Elizabeth I's relationship with her advisors, Walsingham and Raleigh. Elizabeth I had few peers, and it's difficult to predict her decisions, or her motivations, because her advisors constantly counselled her in ways that were contrary to their own personal interests. 

Also, perhaps Elizabeth could have learned something from her encounter with the Spanish Armada, which provided a near-death experience for the English people and forced Elizabeth to reassess her role as the Virgin Queen, as well as her stance on religion. She could have spent the rest of her reign seeking to shore up the foundations of her kingdom, rather than marching to war, in order to ensure her place as the Queen of England and the protector of her people.
