Magus makes so much money selling forgeries because he is an old swindler and art-dealer who specializes in commissioning mediocre painter Pierre Grassou de Foug√®res to paint forgeries of famous artists such as Titian, Raphael, and other famous artists. Grassou is able to sell these forgeries for a large profit to members of the Petite bourgeoisie who are incapable of appreciating good art, and Magus is able to make a significant income from this arrangement.
