Govinda finally finds enlightenment after his earlier childhood friend, Vasudeva, reminds him of the importance of loving the world in its fullness and not seeking completeness in things and experiences. Because there is always something opposite to what one believes, each individual pursues truth with their own lens, and in a world where no truth is absolute and no perspective is complete, Govinda must continue to seek truth in a different way, that is, without looking outward into a fixed belief or perspective. In this way, he eventually finds peace, wisdom, and realization.
