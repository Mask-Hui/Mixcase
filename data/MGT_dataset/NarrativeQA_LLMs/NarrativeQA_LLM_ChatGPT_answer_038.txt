Irene is rescued from the goblins by Curdie, the young miner whom she befriended after he saved her and her nursemaid from being chased by the goblins. Curdie later learns about the goblins' plan to abduct the princess and marry her to goblin prince Harelip, and warns the palace guards about it. When the goblins break through the palace floor and come to abduct Irene, Curdie stamps on their feet, causing them to retreat, and then follows Irene's magic thread to her refuge at his own house and restores her to the king.
