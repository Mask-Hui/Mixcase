The prompt is a question to answer, task or conversation. The response is a quote from the book "The Jewish State" by Theodor Herzl, translated and reprinted in Dover 1988. The quote is from page 95 of the book and states that "important experiments in colonization have been made, though on the mistaken principle of a gradual infiltration of Jews. An infiltration is bound to end badly." Herzl opposed the efforts already made by Zionist groups to settle Jews in Ottoman-controlled Palestine by arguing that "an infiltration is bound to end badly."
