The question is based on the context that Bill knocks down a boss in the steel mill and Abby helps him escape. The boss was later found murdered and Bill was accused of the crime. The story took place in 1916 and the world was very different then then, there was no cell phone, so friends would probably know each other for years. The question here is which friend would be able to identify that Bill and Abby are not related?
