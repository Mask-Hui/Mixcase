The house was named "Almayer's Folly" by Dutch seamen because Almayer had built a large, lavish house near where he resided in anticipation of the British conquering the Pantai River. However, the conquest never took place and the house remained unfinished, leading the passing Dutch seamen to call it a folly, as it was a waste of resources and effort.
