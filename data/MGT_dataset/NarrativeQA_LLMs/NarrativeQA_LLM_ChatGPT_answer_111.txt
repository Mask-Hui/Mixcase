In the context provided, the Saarne Institute is a mental hospital located in Estonia. Kate discovers that Esther, the adopted 9-year-old girl, had a hidden Bible that came from this institute, prompting her to email the facility to ask for more information. Later, Dr. Värava, the director of the Saarne Institute, reveals to Kate that Esther is actually a 33-year-old woman named Leena Klammer, who has a hormone disorder that stunted her physical growth, and has spent most of her life posing as a little girl and had people adopt her, with the goal of seducing the father and having a sexual relationship with him. Dr. Värava also reports that Leena has murdered at least seven people.
