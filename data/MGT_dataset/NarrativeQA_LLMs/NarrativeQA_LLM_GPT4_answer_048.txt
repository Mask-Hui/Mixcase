The prompt provided is a conversation between Beerbohm and Soames about a fictional story Beerbohm wrote in which Soames is a character. Beerbohm denies that he would ever write such a story, but Soames believes that Beerbohm would try to make people believe he existed. Beerbohm notes that Soames was described as "dim" and that people would stare at him, follow him around and seem afraid of him. Beerbohm concludes that the article was written by T.K Nupton, who had not finished reading Beerbohm's story.
