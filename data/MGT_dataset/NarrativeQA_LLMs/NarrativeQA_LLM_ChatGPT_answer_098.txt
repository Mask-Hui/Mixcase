He falls in love with Almayer's daughter Nina and vows to return to help Almayer find the gold mine. However, he is later killed on the orders of the Malayan rajah, who instructs him to kill Almayer before the Dutch arrive because he is not needed to find the gold now. His anklet and ring are placed on the body of Almayer's slave, which is found floating in the river, making Almayer believe that Dain is dead.
