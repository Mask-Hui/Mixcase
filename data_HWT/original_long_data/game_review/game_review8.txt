This game is a masterpiece of writing, voice acting, and musical talent. In fact, throughout my time with the game, I had to remind myself to sleep, so that I could better understand the story, and improve my performance in the game.   My heart was pumping whenever Geralt entered combat, as the music was that intense. I was moved emotionally by the voice acting. The combat is engaging, and it turns out that the combat phenomenal. There is no one attack that 'beats everything'.  Know this, whatever you do, play the game on the second highest/highest difficulty. It is the only way to truly play the game.  However, this game does have it's flaws. Not in storytelling, or gameplay, but with a couple of technical issues. A few times, I could not exit the conversations I was in with NPCs. Others, my game froze a few times, but the autosave is pretty good, and I only lost about 5-10 mins of gameplay.  9/10   (ONLY because the crashes/bugs were annoying, but not too plentiful to ruin the experience)  Witcher 3 is more than a game, it is an experience.  CDProjektRed...  *Applauds vigorously*   Well Done.    PS: Get the game when its on sale with the DLC bundled in!  PPS: For real people, I had to force myself to not look up spoilers to the consequences of actions in game. That's how badly I wanted the 'best ending'.
