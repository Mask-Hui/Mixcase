(Review counted as the Complete Sam and Max Seasons 1,2 and 3 HOWEVER seasons 1 and 2 currently do not work on Windows 10) Really entertaining and funny point and click adventure game. Though I admit I am a bit dumb when it came to puzzles in this game...often ended up looking up guides &gt;w&gt; SHHHHH! In all honesty the puzzles (basicly everything you do in the game) are all well thought out so there isn't any super unrealistic answer to a problem that hasn't been hinted slightly in the game....Like pixel searching or using items together in a way that makes no sense to solve a problem.  Get it if you love point and click adventure games because this is as good as it gets!! ^.^ As long as you dont mind 15 games appearing in your games library after only buying 3.....
