Crysis 2 is a very solid and enjoyable game. The graphics are beautiful and the suit system has been revamped in a good way. I didn't find that the loss of the sandbox navigation of the first game detracts from gameplay at all, which I've heard was a common complaint; personally, I felt it made things easier because Crysis 1 always had me wondering if I was going in the right direction.  I disliked the change to a silent protagonist and I was disappointed that the story wasn't continued as Nomad, which I think could have been accomplished. I also think that the story felt just a tad too silly with character reactions and revelations throughout the game.  Finally, I'm sad to say that using the stealth suit is still the most overpowered way to finish the entire game because enemies suddenly lose track of you when you stealth, and I had multiple occasions where they would shoot straight at me and every bullet/shotgun pellet would pass straight around me. Probably worth buying anyway.
