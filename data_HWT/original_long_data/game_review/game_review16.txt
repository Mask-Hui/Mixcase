I could tell by the menu screen this game was going to be creepy.   First Night: I look at my cameras and notice the bear is starting to move a little. I start to think everything is ok but its been awhile since I checked my cameras. I glance down at my camera and see there is no bunny. It takes me a second to process it and I pull up the camera a second time to confirm that the bunny is gone. Now I'm starting to hear things in the hallway and I start to press my light in small flickers trying to conserve power. I turn the light on and then the bunny is right there leaning in the room and I about have a heart attack as I reach and slam the door button down. When 6 clock comes around and you still have enough battery to keep your door closed it will be such a relief.   I made it to Night 3 on my first go but didnt press the door quickly enough and its really scarry if you dont :(
