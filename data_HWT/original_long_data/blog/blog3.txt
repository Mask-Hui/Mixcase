        An Epiphany  Fred, you probably should stop reading this right now. I know how you hate it when I get philosophical.  But I had an epiphany last night.  I was practicing yoga and almost ready to go into the rest pose when it hit me.  I've always said that pain is a warning, but I never really fully understood that, until last night.   I didn't hurt myself or anything.  I was sitting with my legs (almost) in lotus, with my forehead resting on the floor.  And I had this urge in the back of my head to sit up.  I resisted as long as I could, but then I realized that I needed to sit up.  The urge was strong enough to push me up.    In that position, I always think about being a seed buried deep in the dirt.  What makes it want to grow?  It must be that urge to rise.  The hunger and need to change and grow.  You know how an old pair of shoes can just start to hurt?  Time for new ones.  Or when those size 6 jeans just don't fit anymore?  Time to acknowledge there's been a change, and react with a change of jeans.    On a deeper level, sometimes when we feel like something just isn't right it's because we need to grow, to make a change.  The hard part isn't only noticing the hurt, but also figuring out what's causing the hurt.  Discovering what needs to change can be so very hard.  But, once you figure it out, the ache goes away.  That little urge inside you, bugging the hell out of you, quiets down and goes away when you've taken the right action and made the right change.  Everything changes, and when we don't change too, it just hurts.  Diva out.
